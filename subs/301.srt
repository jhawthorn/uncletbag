1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,914
<i>Michael Bluth began his day
with something he'd never seen before.</i>

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,184
<i>I'm hearing good things
about the Bluth Company.</i>

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,725
<i>Good news about
his family's housing business.</i>

8
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,125
<i>Old man Bluth's in jail.
I think his son is running the company.</i>

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,460
<i>Doesn't seem like
a total moron to me.</i>

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:36,899
<i>I've had this thing as a triple sell,
and I am upgrading it right here, right now.</i>

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,404
<i>I think this thing could even
go as high as a "Don't Buy."</i>

12
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,874
Don't buy! Huh?
Mom, did you see that?

13
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:49,074
<i>- Don't buy Bluth!</i>
- You build a house that's good, people are gonna wanna come...

14
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,815
This sinkhole spread
a little bit more last night?

15
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,721
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the prison.
I'm gonna tell Dad about this news.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,919
- I thought you said we shouldn't visit him.
- Visit, no. Gloat, yes.

17
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,054
I've worked very very hard for this.
I sold the cabin property to keep us afloat.

18
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,827
I haven't had any time
to spend with my son.

19
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:12,428
Now you can spend time with <i>my</i> son.
I want your brother Buster to come live with you.

20
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,236
And it's not because he has
that horrible hook for a hand now.

21
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,537
It's the snoring.
Listen to this.

22
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,909
<i>Buster's snoring. Wednesday night.</i>

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,074
<i>It's driving me cra...</i>

24
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,152
You won't even know he's here.

25
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,516
You seem more villainous than usual, Mom.
Are you sober?

26
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,454
- Michael, it's 8:00 a.m.
- So, it's not that.

27
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,753
I don't know.

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,091
Maybe it's because I went off
my postpartum medication.

29
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,961
You were still taking that?
You had Buster 32 years ago.

30
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,261
And that's how long
I've been depressed about him.

31
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:47,305
Actually, I did go off it in the early '90s,
but I didn't like what happened to me.

32
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,002
<i>Claiming she could take it no more,
the young mother released the emergency brake...</i>

33
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,945
<i>allowing her car to roll backwards
into the nearby lake.</i>

34
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,039
Good for her.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,710
I must have gained three pounds.

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,788
Why did you go off them
this time?

37
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,256
Well, apparently, mood-altering medication
leads to street drugs.

38
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,022
That's what this very handsome
young doctor said on the Today Show.

39
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,065
That was Tom Cruise,
the actor.

40
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,135
They said he was
some kind of scientist.

41
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,363
Maybe you should get away
from Buster.

42
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,339
- Why don't you go up to the cabin in the woods.
- I thought you said we sold it.

43
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,240
We sold the property. I worked it out
so we could relocate the cabin...

44
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,075
but it is gonna be up in Tahoe
for another couple of days.

45
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,945
Maybe you can
take a date up there.

46
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,510
How am I supposed to find someone
willing to go into that musty old claptrap?

47
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,394
The cabin. Yes.
That would be difficult too.

48
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,658
Please get back on the meds, Mom.
We miss the <i>old</i> old you.

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,534
I didn't even know
that we had a cabin.

50
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,769
Ah!@%$. Well, for what it's worth,
I've never actually been there.

51
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,776
<i>Although he'd often been promised.</i>

52
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,869
<i>Hey, pal. Something's come up.</i>

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,246
<i>This nice young lady has lost her puppy
and your dad's got to help her find him.</i>

54
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,843
<i>Oh, bad news, buddy.
This young lady's dad is sick...</i>

55
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,253
<i>and I'm taking her
to the hospital.</i>

56
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,554
<i>Come on. You're old enough
to figure this out. I'm nailing this broad.</i>

57
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,630
Pardon me if I don't
burst into tears, Michael...

58
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,426
but at least
he promised to take you.

59
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,434
He just let me blindly
enjoy my childhood.

60
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,403
I didn't even know there was a cabin
he wasn't taking me to.

61
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,906
Mmm. Mine's sadder.

62
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,101
I don't see you crying, robot!

63
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,304
You taste these tears.
Taste my sad.

64
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,382
No. Not gonna
lick your eye, okay.

65
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,246
Well, I will tell you this, Michael.
I don't have a son.

66
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,252
<i>- He does.</i>
- But if I ever do...

67
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,254
I'm either gonna take him
to the cabin in the woods...

68
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,381
or I'm gonna promise to take him
and then not take him.

69
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,426
But the one thing
that I will never do...

70
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:53,090
is not tell him that I'm taking him to
a cabin in the woods, and then not take him.

71
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,099
<i>Gob was growing up.</i>

72
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,398
Well, the cabin in the woods is gonna
be stacked up next to our carport.

73
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,871
But maybe we should head up
there tonight, huh?

74
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,411
One... first time.

75
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,139
- Taste the happy, Michael.
- Oh, no.

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,341
- Taste it.
- Tastes kind of like sad.

77
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,114
<i>Michael set off to prison to tell off
his father when he discovered his son.</i>

78
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,416
- George Michael?
- Dad, hey.

79
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,822
- What are you doing?
- I didn't wanna miss you because
you've been leaving so early lately.

80
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,690
You slept out here
to see me?

81
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:26,424
<i>Michael had never been
so touched by something his son had said.</i>

82
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:31,526
<i>But it wasn't true. He was hiding
from his cousin after an awkward incident.</i>

83
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,874
<i>They'd since been trying
to avoid each other...</i>

84
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,604
<i>which was difficult,
considering they shared a bunk bed.</i>

85
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,648
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hi.</i>

86
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,278
- I'm off to the car.
- I'll be in the crawl space.

87
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,119
- How would you like to head up to the cabin?
- Can you afford to skip work?

88
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,786
I think the president of a "Don't Buy" company
can afford to take a day off.

89
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,295
We're up from "Sell"?

90
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,662
- It's happening, isn't it?
- It's really happening.

91
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,826
It's time for us to start
creating some memories.

92
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,301
There's been enough disappointment
in this family.

93
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,742
There's only one sleeping bag, so we're gonna
have to double up. Pigs in a blanket!

94
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,508
Sorry, pal.
Something came up.

95
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,884
It is worse to know.

96
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,386
<i>Gob was getting life lessons all over the place.</i>

97
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,685
<i>And Michael broke a two-month silence
and went to visit his father.</i>

98
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,124
You came!
Someone came!

99
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:33,255
Only to tell you that the company is back
on track and it's because you're behind bars.

100
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,097
And now I get to do with my son what you
never did with me. I'm taking him to the cabin.

101
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,433
...scar!
And every night...

102
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,531
I'm scarred too, but my son
is not going to be.

103
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,874
And they cover it with soap,
and you're supposed to thank them.

104
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,947
Like they're doing you a favor!

105
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,575
- Anything you'd like for me to pass on to the family?
- I'm your uncle!

106
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,621
I'm your dad's twin brother!

107
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm Oscar!
He switched on me.

108
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,187
No one believes me.

109
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,322
<i>Unfortunately for Oscar, "you've
got the wrong twin" was a very popular alibi.</i>

110
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,332
You've simply got
the wrong twin.

111
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,732
We're quadruplets.
You've got the wrong two.

112
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,931
- We're Larry and Dave.
- You want Curtis and Jeff.

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,907
I even started a Web site...
imoscar.com.

114
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,739
I'm innocent, Michael.

115
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,940
I'm Oscar!
Dot com!

116
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,744
Don't buy it.
I'm taking my son to the cabin...

117
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:31,722
and there's nothing you can say
to make me believe that you are not my father.

118
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,224
I understand.

119
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,989
Your child comes first.

120
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,232
- Oh, my God. You're Oscar.
- Dot com.

121
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,676
<i>So Michael returned
to the office to try and free his uncle.</i>

122
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,644
Don't buy! Don't buy!
Don't buy!

123
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,943
<i>When he realized how much that freedom
would cost his employees.</i>

124
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,280
Don't buy! We did it, Mikey.
We're super rich again.

125
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,911
And I'm gonna buy a car.
The Volvo.

126
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,014
<i>Lindsay, you're not gonna start spending money.
And this is not a Vol-vo.</i>

127
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,025
- That's from sitting on the copier.
- Lindsay...

128
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,188
Michael, I've got nothing. My husband dumped me
and ran off to Vegas with Kitty.

129
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,324
- That bleached blonde whore.
- He's definitely got a type.

130
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,335
I can't believe he left me.

131
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,099
I mean, this and these and this!

132
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,606
- That's the car.
- Oh.

133
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,438
- This.
- Glad I didn't spring for color.

134
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,809
The only reason you want Tobias
is because you can't have him.

135
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,712
And the second that you can have something,
all of a sudden you don't want it.

136
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,150
- That's not who I am, Michael.
- No? All right, maybe you're right.

137
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,280
- Maybe we should get you this car.
- I don't know. It's so boxy.

138
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,728
- Gob.
- Oh, Michael.

139
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,798
- How's Dad?
- Uh, I don't know.

140
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:50,130
It's Oscar who's in prison.
If I let him out, people will know Dad is free...

141
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,034
and those people out there
will end up paying for it.

142
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,269
Dad hasn't, uh, tried
to contact you, has he?

143
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,312
Like I'd ever hear from that son of a bitch.

144
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,349
<i>Earlier that day,
Gob received a letter from a group...</i>

145
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,387
<i>that reunited abandoned sons
with their fathers, called SAD.</i>

146
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,255
Father-son reunion?
But Dad's still in prison.

147
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,259
<i>But now the letter made sense.</i>

148
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,422
- That son of a bitch.
<i>- Law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

149
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,558
- Hi, it's Michael Bluth for Barry.
<i>- Barry went to Reno to see your father.</i>

150
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,160
- Reno? He said he's been visiting my father in prison.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

151
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,764
Barry says a lot of things
he doesn't mean.

152
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,401
Well, I guess I'm going
to Reno to look for Dad.

153
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,913
Good luck, favorite son.

154
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,041
<i>So once again, Michael went after the father...</i>

155
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,210
<i>who'd once again abandoned him,
only to find...</i>

156
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,847
<i>he was about to do
the same thing to his own son.</i>

157
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,016
It's not happening, is it?

158
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,855
Something came up.

159
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,433
<i>Michael had just told his son
they wouldn't be going to the cabin.</i>

160
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,529
But the cabin's in Lake Tahoe.
That's right near Reno, and we could...

161
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,609
But this is gonna be like an adult trip.
Aunt Lindsay will be here.

162
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,735
Hi. Hey, why don't you pop a tent
in front with your cousin Maeby?

163
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,247
- What? No!
- I'm not really the outdoorsy type.

164
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:15,218
Well, then this is a good chance
for you to rub off on her.

165
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,382
<i>As Michael set out to find his father...</i>

166
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,426
<i>Gob thought he was doing
the same.</i>

167
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,894
<i>There's my guy!</i>

168
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,932
Hey, buddy, come on.

169
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,632
Gettin' 'em to track down
your dad too?

170
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,968
- My dad actually had them track me down.
- Oh.

171
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,977
But... it does look like
he's not gonna show.

172
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,515
<i>Kind of feel like that kid
who found the severed hand.</i>

173
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,746
Hey, Dad, look what I found.

174
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,550
Anything for his father's approval.

175
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,115
- Heartbreaking.
- You look familiar.

176
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,094
I think that's because
we actually kind of look alike.

177
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,665
<i>Remember when I said Gob had a son?</i>

178
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,098
- I'm Gob.
<i>- I wasn't just saying that.</i>

179
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,501
<i>In high school, Gob became
intimate with these girls.</i>

180
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,133
<i>These girls got pregnant.
This one had a baby.</i>

181
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,543
<i>And that baby would grow up to be...</i>

182
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,845
Steve Holt.

183
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,144
All I ever wanted was to spend
a little time with my dad.

184
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,344
Maybe go camping.
But I guess that will never happen.

185
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,218
I know this is gonna sound
kind of crazy...

186
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,121
but my family has a cabin
in the woods for one more night.

187
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,195
Maybe we could go up to Reno,
get the keys and go camping.

188
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,164
You know, sort of...
a son-and-son thing.

189
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,757
<i>If Steve had had a father,
he would've warned him...</i>

190
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,997
<i>not to go into the woods
with strange men, but he didn't.</i>

191
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,041
- Sure! Let's go!
- Okay. Great.

192
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,042
- This is me right here.
- Okay.

193
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,736
- Yeah, baby!
- Emo!

194
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,474
<i>Michael, meanwhile, arrived in Reno...</i>

195
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,710
<i>a city competing
with Las Vegas's successful...</i>

196
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,049
<i>"What Happens in Vegas
Stays in Vegas" campaign...</i>

197
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,350
<i>and set about searching
for Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

198
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:03,053
I'm looking for a man who's probably
in the seedy underbelly of Reno.

199
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:08,725
Oh, the Christian League had the Seedy
Underbelly shut down. Now it's a Swallows.

200
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,826
<i>Swallows was a family-style restaurant by day...</i>

201
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,100
<i>and an anything-goes,
pansexual bazaar by night.</i>

202
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,643
<i>Can I interest you in
a smoothie or an amyl... Michael!</i>

203
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:23,044
Tobias, I thought that you were in Vegas
with Kitty and the Blue Man Group?

204
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,811
No, as it turns out,
the part that I'd...

205
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,580
destroyed my life to get
had already been cast.

206
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,625
<i>The role was filled by George Sr.,
who used it to hide in plain sight.</i>

207
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,717
<i>That is until he choked
on a marshmallow...</i>

208
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,922
<i>and almost died when
no one noticed he turned blue.</i>

209
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,434
So, Kitty suggested we come
up here to try out in Reno, and...

210
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,595
Uh, I'll be honest, Michael...

211
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:50,267
leaving Lindsay was the biggest
little mistake I've ever made.

212
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,436
I can't seem to call her though.
Damn this pride of mine!

213
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,379
Tuna melt's up, and you need
to flip the cushions in the grind room.

214
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,919
Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Great. Now I'm gonna
be smelling to high heaven like a tuna melt.

215
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,979
What would you say if I told you that Lindsay
might be willing to get back together with you?

216
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,389
Oh, uh, I'll call her right now.

217
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,554
Why don't you let me handle it? You know
Lindsay. She only wants what she can't have.

218
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,691
- What would you do about Kitty?
- I can't lie to you, Michael.

219
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,326
Kitty left me two days ago.

220
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,668
There's a blue handprint on the back of your head,
Kitty. Are you seeing someone else?

221
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,574
Face it, Tobias.
It's over!

222
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,272
- Say good-bye to these!
- Those are blue too!

223
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,245
There were blue handprints on them?

224
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,079
Yes. And I swear to you,
they weren't...

225
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,676
Yours. No, I know.
It all points to Dad.

226
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,848
Dad's in Reno, Kitty's in Reno.
Dad's in Kitty, and he must be a Blue Man.

227
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,894
- I'm gonna go check out the theater.
- Okay, I'll meet you there.

228
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,624
I just have to break down the salad bar
and set up the leather pony.

229
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,293
- What's a leather pony?
- I don't know. We don't have that at lunch.

230
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,532
<i>So Michael called Lindsay
to say he'd found her husband.</i>

231
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,041
- All right, I'm on my way.
- No, no. I'll just bring him back with me.

232
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,046
- He wants to come home?
- I mean, against his will.

233
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,673
Knock him out if you have to.
He's my husband!

234
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,344
Just watch the kids
like you promised, okay?

235
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,944
- I'm not...
- Neither am I!

236
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,955
Hold it.

237
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,857
<i>And the kids found themselves
closer than ever on the bumpy road to Reno.</i>

238
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:17,986
<i>Hello?</i>

239
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,500
Lindsay, hey, hi. Michael said not to call you,
but I missed you so much.

240
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,501
You miss me?

241
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,037
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

242
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,007
I was driving out there, but this is crazy.
We have to be realistic.

243
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,078
But the thing is,
I can't leave Kitty.

244
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,239
What, with all the sexual intercourse
and whatnot.

245
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,543
- You bastard!
- What are you doing?

246
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,085
- Nothing!
- I will be backstage...

247
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,314
after the Blue Man show
whether Kitty likes it or not.

248
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,322
Sounds good.
One quick question.

249
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:50,225
What if Kitty's not there and I'm less
of a Blue Man and more of a cocktail waitress?

250
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,820
- She's turning again.
- Hang up!

251
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,422
<i>I'll see you there. Thank you. Bye.</i>

252
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,331
<i>Michael was already
at the theater looking for George Sr...</i>

253
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,166
<i>when he ran into Barry
doing the same thing.</i>

254
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,833
- Hey! Barry.
- Hi, Mikey. So, how much do you know?

255
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,037
I know that Oscar is in prison,
and that my father is a Blue Man...

256
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,377
- and that you are clearly in cahoots with him.
- Ooh, a lot.

257
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,382
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

258
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,577
I was gonna meet him here,
but he must've seen you and run off.

259
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,680
I was gonna give him this...
$250,000 and a passport.

260
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,192
- Just a passport.
- Well, I was up for so long.

261
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,094
- Barry, you're fired.
- What?

262
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,462
- Yeah.
- Just like that?

263
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,762
No warning?
You're my only client.

264
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,361
What am I supposed to do now,
turn tricks on the street?

265
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,463
How much do you think I can get
for that, by the way?

266
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,202
- I've got to let Oscar out of prison.
- What about making out?

267
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,939
Fifty dollars, or is that just LA?
Am I just...

268
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,553
<i>Soon, Lindsay arrived at the hotel...</i>

269
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,055
<i>and the kids finally faced facts.</i>

270
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:56,150
Look, it was just a half kiss. Maybe that's
the reason why we're acting weird.

271
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,322
It was because we didn't finish the kiss?
Is that what you w...

272
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,229
Yeah. Do you think we should
just finish the kiss? Get it out of the way.

273
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,598
Let's get it out of the way.

274
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,764
Hey, kids, bring the bags.
We're sharing a room.

275
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,968
- Let's meet back here tomorrow morning, okay?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,569
- Go.
- Are you... Yeah, I'm gonna...

277
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,981
I'm gonna stay out here
and watch that famous Reno sunset.

278
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,251
Isn't it behind you?

279
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,951
There's... Yeah, but there's mirrors.
It'll actually look closer.

280
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,119
<i>While George Michael waited for the sunset...</i>

281
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,322
<i>another set of sons arrived.</i>

282
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,629
Michael said he'd meet me here.
I'll get the keys to the cabin, son.

283
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,604
I'll go buy some fishing stuff, son.

284
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,267
- So, where did you get this kid?
- I guess I can tell you now.

285
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,868
We were both waiting for our dads at that garden
where the little boy found the arm.

286
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,610
Kid's amazing, though.
It's almost like... I wish he could be my dad.

287
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,085
Okay, um, your dad's not trying
to find you, your son is.

288
00:15:56,188 --> 00:16:00,056
That kid's your son.
You're the dad, hmm?

289
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,627
I've made a huge tiny mistake.

290
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,396
Gob. You can't just leave your son
in the middle of a parking lot in Reno.

291
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:15,200
<i>And that's when Michael
saw his own son in a parking lot in Reno.</i>

292
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,834
He drove all the way up here
to be with me. Wow.

293
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,640
Well, I guess I'm, uh...
I'm no better than...

294
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,984
No, I'm better.

295
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,214
<i>They were an hour out of Reno
when George Michael woke up.</i>

296
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,257
You were out like a light, pal.
Our dreams are about to come true.

297
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,259
- Maeby?
- Definitely!

298
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,829
We are going camping.
It's finally happening.

299
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,099
It's never happening.

300
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,302
<i>Michael had just surprised
his sleeping son by taking him camping.</i>

301
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,807
I put this off too long,
and it's too important.

302
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,844
Your Uncle Oscar can stay
in prison one more day, right?

303
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,744
<i>Not according to that
day's blog on imoscar.com.</i>

304
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,841
This here is way more important
than me trying to find my father.

305
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,853
Although, I was very close.
I almost had Pop-Pop in Reno.

306
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,549
Me too.

307
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,252
<i>As Michael was forcibly taking
his son out to the cabin...</i>

308
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,196
<i>Lucille was ready to forcibly throw hers out.</i>

309
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:26,467
Well, that was a freebie.

310
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,309
<i>Lucille didn't trust herself
to be in the house when Buster returned.</i>

311
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,943
<i>So, she headed off to the cabin
Michael said would be unoccupied.</i>

312
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,216
<i>Tobias, meanwhile, was looking
for a way to make his wife jealous...</i>

313
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,884
<i>by convincing her that he was not only
a Blue Man, but still with Kitty...</i>

314
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:46,090
<i>when he came across a makeup woman who,
coincidentally, looked a great deal like Kitty.</i>

315
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:51,659
If this tableau I re-create,
perhaps I can re-snare my mate.

316
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,068
<i>Gee, why wouldn't she want him back?</i>

317
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:58,132
<i>And Michael and his son arrived
at the cabin in the woods.</i>

318
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,678
Looks like they have
trucked off the bedrooms.

319
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,649
Maybe we'll just set up some sleeping bags
right here in the living room, huh?

320
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,744
<i>Lucille, meanwhile, heard a familiar sound.</i>

321
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,348
- Oh, come on!
- Mother?

322
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,258
What the hell are
you doing back there?

323
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,991
I decided to sleep in the car
so my snoring wouldn't bother you...

324
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,036
and I left that recording of my snoring
so you wouldn't know I'm gone.

325
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:29,198
We're halfway to the cabin.
I'm gonna drop you by this light.

326
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:34,211
Or I could come with you. That might be
the exact shot in the arm our relationship needs.

327
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,647
Well, at least I'll have someone
to talk to on the way up.

328
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,459
This is fun, isn't it? This is just like
when we used to live up in the attic.

329
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,531
Yeah.

330
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,160
Or... Or we could
go back to Reno.

331
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,238
Go back to Reno?
You don't wanna be here?

332
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,332
You've been sleeping in the stair car
just so we can spend time together.

333
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,343
That's not totally true though.

334
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,505
- I'm just in the middle of a problem right now.
- Oh, yeah?

335
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,209
- Well, let's talk about it.
- I can't talk about it with you.

336
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,582
- Why not?
- It's about a girl, and you're not gonna like this.

337
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,484
- Is it about Ann?
- No.

338
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,989
Oh. Of course I don't like it.

339
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:25,189
- I like Ann.
- No, it's just...

340
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,197
It's a problem without an answer.

341
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,199
Well, every problem has an answer.

342
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,260
You're probably just confused because
you're going through all of this alone.

343
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,603
And that's exactly why we need
to spend this time together.

344
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,506
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I know so.

345
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,375
So here's the plan. Tomorrow morning
we're gonna get up early.

346
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,814
Before we tell the cops
that Pop-Pop escaped from prison...

347
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,615
we're gonna go down to the lake,
discuss your girl problem, and it's gonna be fun.

348
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,485
Especially the part about the cops.
All right?

349
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,890
Whatever your problem is with the girl,
we're gonna figure it out.

350
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,224
That's what this place is for.

351
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,457
That, and cheating on Gangy.

352
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,263
- I'm really glad you brought me here, Dad.
- Yeah, we needed this.

353
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,964
And this time, I'm not gonna
let the family drag me away.

354
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>The next morning, Michael rose
early to spend the day with his son...</i>

355
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,305
<i>only to find himself, once again,
dragged away by his family.</i>

356
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,974
Dad! What the hell
are you doing?

357
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:25,318
Sorry. I can't let you let Oscar out
of prison or they'll come for me.

358
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,052
Hey, how do you like the cabin?

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,264
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

360
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,428
<i>Lucille arrives at the cabin.</i>

361
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,302
!@%$ me, there's no cabin.

362
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,672
- Mother?
- Oh, my God!

363
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,613
You still doing breakfast burritos?

364
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,914
<i>- Maeby finds someone to help her forget her cousin.</i>
- Being stood up.

365
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,750
- Yeah, me too.
<i>- Her cousin.</i>

366
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,416
- Wanna make out?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

367
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,857
<i>And Lindsay catches up
with Tobias.</i>

368
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,122
Get your hands off
my husband, Kitty.

369
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,129
Did someone say "husband"?

370
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,135
I want a divorce.

371
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,502
And I would be thrilled to
represent either one of you.

372
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,871
That'll be $50.

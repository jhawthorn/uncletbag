00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,523
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,626 --> 00:00:07,560
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:17,363
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:23,301
<i>Low-carb diets</i>
<i>are sweeping the nation...</i>

6
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:25,436
but some local businesses
are being left in the dust.

7
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,980
- And the latest on Iraq...
- Hey, George Michael.

8
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:31,142
They're gonna show that interview you did.
We're gonna watch it on Thursday, okay?

9
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,550
- I'll make some popcorn.
- <i>Popcorn? Really? Cool.</i>

10
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:36,248
- Yeah, the hell with Atkins, huh?
- Oh. Yeah.

11
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:38,723
Oh, why blow it now?
I'll fry up some bacon.

12
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:41,454
Uh, Dad...

13
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,532
Buddy, you gotta
take it easy, okay?

14
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,533
I'm showing this
as a model again.

15
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,468
I don't want people to think
we've got shoddy workmanship.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,004
That might not
have been your fault.

17
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,600
I know. Nothing works
in this house.

18
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,907
- Tell me about it.
- Is that a shot at me?

19
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:02,642
- <i>Probably.</i>
- Because for your information, I got a job.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,810
- Really? What kind of job?
- Beads.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,083
- Bees?
- Beads.
- Beads?

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,387
- Gob's not on board.
- Beads are very big right now.

23
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:15,189
Uh, anklets,
necklaces, you name it.

24
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:18,094
- Bracelets?
- But I'll need some start-up money.

25
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,531
I'm in. But we're
gonna need a lot.

26
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,762
Beads aren't cheap.
Are beads cheap?

27
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,963
Gob, shouldn't you
be in bed?

28
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:27,097
Well, we got a meeting
with Dad's attorney today.

29
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,108
He's gonna want me to
take a lie-detector test...

30
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,940
to use as evidence
in Dad's trial, but, uh, I don't want to.

31
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:34,514
What if they ask about a magic trick?
I just... I can't risk it.

32
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:38,517
They're not gonna ask you anything.
They want me to take the polygraph test.

33
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,780
But... I'm the oldest.

34
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:43,379
- The matriarch, if you will.
- Sure. I will.

35
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:47,450
Listen, I have to do this to help out Dad,
and you don't know anything about our business.

36
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:51,657
<i>Gob, I'm not looking for a partner. And,</i>
<i>believe me, if I was, it would not be you.</i>

37
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,064
Oh. Good.

38
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:57,296
Well, I'll start my own business.
How hard can it be?

39
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:59,498
Z-z-z-z-z!

40
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,336
Bz-z-z-z-z-z!

41
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:03,808
We'll see who
brings in more honey.

42
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,243
[Buzzing]

43
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:08,713
- He's thinking about bees again.
- Oh.

44
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:12,047
I'm not just gonna cut you a check so you can
throw it away on another failed business.

45
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,519
Hey, "Mommy, What Will I
Look Like?" should have worked.

46
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:17,682
<i>[Man Narrating] Lindsay had once started</i>
<i>a photo-enhancing service...</i>

47
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,886
<i>which gave new parents a glimpse at</i>
<i>what their infants would look like...</i>

48
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,020
<i>in half a century.</i>

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,827

<i>surprised when an ugly adult comes out.</i>

50
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:30,529
Look, I need to become self-reliant.
It's not gonna last with Tobias.

51
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:34,506
He's completely oblivious.
He's got no idea how I'm feeling or thinking.

52
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:38,510
- So there's no sex?
- I mean, how do you not have sex with me?

53
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:41,274
It is a struggle.
I'll tell you what.

54
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:43,282
I'll help you out,
but you gotta work.

55
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:45,852
Great. Before you know it,
I'll be in the red.

56
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:48,421
And you can take that
to the bank.

57
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:50,513
I'm sure they'll
contact me first.

58
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:53,354
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Michael</i>

<i>And later, the family waited for Michael</i>
<i>at the prison meeting room.</i>

- How do you make money from it?
- I don't know. Honey?

64
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:09,438
- Or just as gifts.
- Who'd want a bee as a gift?

<i>While Buster and Annyong</i>
<i>waitedjust outside.</i>

66

- Come on. Just let me have one bite.
- No.

67
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,639

68
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,651
get girlfriend
that's not old lady.

69
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:21,347
- At least I can get a girlfriend.
- I can get a girlfriend before you.

70
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:24,083
- Oh, we'll see about that.
- Why aren't you in there?

71
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,887
Oh, I was just keeping
Annyong company.

72
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:30,088
Give me that bagel, you little... [Beeps]
Give it to me! [Beeps]

73

Whoa! Our star witness!
Come here.

74
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,733
Good to see you. You know what?
Don't get too close to me.

75
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:38,737
'Cause I've got an itch you can't believe.
I think something laid eggs on me.

76
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:42,570
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- That's okay. We've got your polygraph
set for tomorrow.

77
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:44,940
- About that...
- <i>I'll tell them, Michael.</i>

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,847
I won't do it.
I'm afraid of what I might know.

79
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,941
You? No one wants you.
Does anyone want him?

80
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:54,418
- Who would want him?
- They don't want you.

81
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:57,320
- Good.
- I might not be the best witness either.

82
00:03:57,424 --> 00:04:00,086
- I got a phone call from Kitty this morning.
- His secretary?

83
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:02,594
- My secretary.
- <i>She says that she's got some evidence...</i>

84
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:05,426
and she's threatening to bring down
the company unless we meet her demands.

<i>[Gob]</i>
<i>Oh, that is just great.</i>

86
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:11,767
And now I'm expected to climb back
on top of Kitty and do my thing again.

87
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:13,806
I mean, this family
runs into problems, it's...

88
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,808
"Oh, let's have Gob
[Beeps] our way out of it."

89
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,141
- What is the matter with you?
- It's me that she wants to meet with, Gob.

90
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,646
Oh. Good.

91
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:24,047
Now, what does she have, Dad?
I need to know.

92
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:26,278
No, you can't know.
We got to keep you nice and clean, Michael.

93
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:30,323
- Especially if you're going
to take that lie detector test.
- He is absolutely right.

94
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:32,756
<i>[George] Find out what Kitty wants</i>

Michael, you can
save this business.

97

You are the only one
who can do it.

98
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,562
<i>Yeah, besides me, right? But I kind of</i>
<i>got my hands full with these babies.</i>

99
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,230
- <i>He's got bees!</i>
- <i>No bees!</i>

- <i>Get it!</i>
- <i>[Jar Rolling]</i>

101

<i>at the banana stand...</i>

- <i>when George Michael made a new friend.</i>
- Hi.

104
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:59,718
- Hi.
- Are bananas high in carbohydrates?

105
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,720
<i>Oh, you're</i>
<i>on Atkins too?</i>

106
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:05,223
Uh, yeah. Actually, that's, um...
that's why I'm gonna be on... on TV.

107
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:08,887
- You are?
- I was interviewed for <i>Hindsight,</i> with John Beard.

108
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:12,261
I, uh, I gave them a joke,
but I don't know if they're gonna use it.

109
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,233
You know, thanks to this diet craze,
the last time we had a customer...

110
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,065
the banana stand
was still green.

111
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:21,505
Lose it. No, lose the whole kid.
We'll just go with the Iraq piece.

112
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,442
- That's so cool.
- I guess.

113

<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>You wanna watch over at my house?</i>

<i>Their last meeting</i>

117
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:38,390
Say good-bye
to your company, Michael.

00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,687
- And say good-bye to these.
- No, no, no, no.

119

<i>So Michael was understandably</i>
<i>anxious about their reunion.</i>

Guess I do get to see them again, huh?
[Chuckles]

121
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:50,369
Can we please have one conversation
that's not about my rack, Michael?

122
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,769
- Yeah.
- Maybe a better question would be...

123
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:54,704
what evidence do I have
against you, because...

124
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,708
No, no, no. I don't...
I don't wanna know.

125
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,108
I just want to know
what you want.

126
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:01,704
I'd like to be in charge
of the Bluth Company.

127
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:05,046
Well, I want a hamburger and French fries,
but I can't have the bun or potatoes. Get real.

128
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:08,644
I deserve it. Your father promised it
to me on the day he went to prison.

129
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:12,884
Sounds like something
that he would do.

130
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:16,793
<i>And if I can't be in charge, then I'm</i>
<i>going to have to tell the entire world...</i>

131
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:19,627
that your father was
building houses overseas...

132
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,133
- without paying...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. Stop.

133
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:26,070
Act... No. Finish. Finish.
Um, without paying what? Taxes?

134
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:29,734
Model houses, Michael.
Overseas.

135
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:32,937
And he hid it...
[Whispering] from the U.S. government.

136
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:35,572
That's it? That's what
my dad's been hiding... back taxes?

137
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:38,481
And unless you plan
on paying them...

138
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:41,986
your dad's gonna be
in prison for a long time.

139
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,923
No, we'll pay them. Forget it. We'll just...
We'll mortgage the company if we have to.

140
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,586
We found money for those.
We'll find money for taxes. Good to see ya.

141
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:53,759
Yeah. If I was in charge,
that would have been my first move too.

142
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,392
<i>[Narrator] As Michael returned home,</i>
<i>George Michael was heading out...</i>

144
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,506
Great news. The business
is gonna be okay.

145
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,599
Yeah, I thought bananas
would be okay on the diet.

146
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,111
No, l-I meant... Well...
You haven't been eating those, have you?

147
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:09,705
- No. No. Not at all. Just some nuts.
- Good. Those are fine.

be seeing Pop-Pop sooner than we thought.

Huh?
Does that sound good?

- It is very worrisome.

- Great news, Michael.

152

a Bluth model home.

00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:35,708
Actually, I am the breadwinner, Michael,
as it turns out.

157
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,834
I was walking
in a strange place today...

158
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,209
<i>a place I'd never</i>
<i>set foot in before.</i>

159
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:43,078
<i>[Narrator] Tobias, walking down a street</i>
<i>he'd been down many times...</i>

160
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:47,415
<i>saw a book he'd written</i>
<i>years earlier as a psychiatrist.</i>

161
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:49,887
<i>The book, initially unsuccessful,</i>
<i>had suddenly caught fire...</i>

162
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,222
<i>although, strangely,</i>
<i>only in the gay community.</i>

163
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:57,855
The book is huge. And I have a bit
of money coming my way as a result.

164
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:01,196
<i>So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to</i>
<i>go upstairs and run the shower.</i>

165
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:03,496
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>if it's too loud in the kitchen.</i>

166
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:05,538
Okay, honey.

167
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,836
So, your husband comes into some money,
and suddenly he's not so oblivious anymore, huh?

168
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,240
Hey, now, this is not me
being shallow, Michael.

169
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,870
He's written a self-help book
that's helping people.

170
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:15,881
- That does take some insight.
- Listen.

171
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:17,883
This better not mean
you're blowing off the bead store.

172
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:21,751
Well, uh, seeing as though you brought it up,
maybe we should get out of this investment.

173
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:24,517
- I mean, seriously, Michael... beads?
- I knew you'd do this.

174
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,253
You work for three seconds,
and you find something easier and grab it.

175
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:29,261
It's "Dip-A-Pet"
all over again.

176
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:32,389
<i>[Narrator] Lindsay also had a brief foray</i>
<i>into what she had then hoped</i>...

177
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:36,560
- Come back here!
- <i>would be the burgeoning fad</i>
<i>of custom pet coloring.</i>

178
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,764
Well, that would've worked
if you'd sprung for a bigger sink.

179
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:42,364
George Michael,
our show's about to start.

180
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:45,036
- He went out on his date.
- A date?

181
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:48,137
<i>But we had plans to</i>...
<i>A date with who?</i>

182
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:51,877
Some girl. I mean, she barely has a face.
You couldn't pick her out of a lineup of one.

183
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:54,317
<i>[Man On TV]</i>
<i>But first, the palaces of Iraq.</i>

184
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:57,584
Trisha, tell us about these new
mini-palaces of Saddam's you've discovered.

185
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,717
Our troops have been living here
for the last few days...

186
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,628
and, as you can tell,
they've made themselves right at home.

187
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:08,565
Now, a lot of this damage
is just due to shoddy workmanship...

188
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:11,467
but the real surprise here
is that these homes...

189
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:14,905
appear to be American-built
to begin with.

190
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,942
There have been sanctions
against doing business...

191
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:19,171
with Hussein's regime
since the early '90s...

192
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,442
- <i>so who built them?</i>
- Does that look a little like our kitchen island?

193
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:25,916
Well, whoever it is,
they're in a world of trouble.

194
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,146
<i>[Narrator] Michael realized</i>
<i>that his father's crimes...</i>

195
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:30,120
<i>might be bigger</i>
<i>than he thought.</i>

196
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:35,025
There's a good chance
I may have committed some light treason.

197
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:39,122
This might even be
considered light treason.

198
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,827
Oh, my God.

199
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:49,476
<i>[Narrator] Michael hadjust found out</i>
<i>his father might have committed...</i>

200
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:53,412
<i>[Narrator] Michael hadjust found out</i>
<i>his father might have committed...</i>

201
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:56,506
<i>some light treason</i>
<i>by building model homes in Iraq.</i>

202
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:59,745
<i>And he tried to get ahold of Kitty,</i>
<i>who he knew had the evidence.</i>

203
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,515
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Kitty was meeting with Gob at the time.</i>

204
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,354
- What about hash browns?
- No, because hash browns are potatoes.

205
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,860
So you really can't
eat anything on this diet.

206
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:12,056
Wow. Wonder how this
is gonna affect my honey business?

207
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,566
Gob, I have seen you
get passed over...

208
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:16,966
time and time again
by your family.

209
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,334
You don't deserve that.
You're smarter than them.

210
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:24,172
What about macaroni...
let me finish... salad?

211
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:26,769
Gob, this is your time.

212
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,781
With my help,
knowing what I know...

213
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:34,013
- we could take over the Bluth Company together.
- Wow!

214
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:36,555
This is a side of you
I'd never noticed before.

215
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:40,184
Have they always
been that big?

216
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,387
<i>[Narrator] And the next day,</i>
<i>Michael went to his mother's.</i>

217
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:45,522
I saw an exposé
on the Iraq palaces last night...

218
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:48,192
and I could have sworn that one of them
was the Sea Wind unit.

219
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,864
That's funny. I always pictured Iraq
in the middle of the desert.

220
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,634
Dad sold houses to the Iraqis,
didn't he?

221
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,266
And this is what you kept from me
so I could take the polygraph test.

222
00:10:57,377 --> 00:11:00,540
Tell me the truth, okay? 'Cause there's been
a lot of lying in this family.

223
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:02,638
And a lot of love.

224
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,274
- More lies.
- Look, I never knew about anything.

225
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,683
But I had my suspicions.

226
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,688
He never told me
where he was going...

227
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,385
but he used to come back from those
business trips reeking of lamb.

228
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:16,360
<i>And people would send figs</i>...
<i>not even at Christmas.</i>

229
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:18,829
In the middle of October.

230
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:21,162
Oh, and once,
someone sent him a toe...

231
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,361
and he went white
as a sheet.

232
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,564
- I think you're right, Michael.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

233
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:30,074
<i>Zero hour, Michael.</i>
<i>It's the end of the line.</i>

234
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:33,806
I'm the first born.
Sick of playing second fiddle.

235
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:37,179
Always third in line for everything.
Tired of finishing fourth.

236
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:39,752
Being the fifth wheel.

237
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,287
There are six things
I'm mad about...

238
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,256
- and I'm taking over.
- You want to be in charge?

239
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,520
- Yeah.
- You want to deal with what I deal with...

240
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:50,995
a sister who takes your money
and throws it away;

241
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:52,998
a mother
who you can't trust;

242
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,228
a company whose founder
may be on trial for treason...

243
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,600
Is that what you want?

244
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:03,142
- What kind of vacation time does it offer?
- Yeah.

245
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:07,612
<i>[Narrator] Gob realized that the power play</i>
<i>he promised to make with Kitty...</i>

246
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:10,774
- <i>had perhaps come at a bad time.</i>
- I've made a huge mistake.

247
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,319
<i>And Tobias was having</i>
<i>his first book reading.</i>

248
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,217
<i>And Tobias was having</i>
<i>his first book reading.</i>

249
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,847
And, for the ease of the reader, I have
changed all the gender-related pronouns...

250
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,858
"he," "she"...
to the masculine "he."

251
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,260
<i>"The Man Inside Me.</i>
For Lindsay, my rock.

252
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,855
I could not have done this
without him."

253
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:31,132
<i>[Narrator] And Lindsay arrived</i>
<i>to support her husband.</i>

254
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:35,698
"For there is a man inside me,
and only when he's finally out...

255
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,210
can I walk free of pain."

256
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:41,747
This book is gonna sell,
like, a billion copies.

257
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,976
<i>Lindsay!</i>
<i>Oh, I'm so glad you came.</i>

258
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:47,019
I was hoping for more women.

259
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,486
Perhaps I shouldn't have just used "he."
I think that was a mistake.

260
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,753
<i>And Lindsay realized that Tobias was just</i>
<i>as oblivious as she'd always thought.</i>

261
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,385
Tobias, I don't think
this relationship is gonna work.

262
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:59,522
What are you talking about?
We've had some great times.

263
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:04,670
We've got nothing left,
Tobias.

264
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:07,137
<i>And Michael went</i>
<i>to confront his father.</i>

265
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,835
You're building houses in Iraq? I mean,
do you know how they punish treason?

266
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:13,174
- First time.
- I've never heard of a second.

267
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,874
Oh, I've got the worst...
[Beeps] attorneys.

268
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:19,008
This is why I didn't want to get you
involved, but we can fix this.

269
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,212
- What are Kitty's demands? What does she want?
- She wants my job.

270
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,289
Suddenly everybody wants my job,
and I should've given it to her.

271
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,690
You mean, you didn't? Michael! She has
the evidence of what we did over there.

272
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:30,285
No, all she thinks it is
is unpaid taxes.

273
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:33,230
Yeah. What if she gives it to someone
who's even moderately intelligent?

274
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,393
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Kitty had gone</i>
<i>to someone moderately intelligent...</i>

275
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:39,563
<i>in her continuing quest for</i>
<i>control of the Bluth Company.</i>

276
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:43,404
- I can't believe you called me for a date.
- You didn't tell anyone, did you?

277
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,445
Are you kidding?
I don't need to brag...

278
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:49,140
<i>that some people haven't</i>
<i>even been on a date!</i>

279

Day not over yet, fatty.

00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,118
<i>You weren't thinking clearly.</i>
<i>I mean, none of us are.</i>

281
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,121
We need bread.

282
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,714
If this information was so damaging,
why didn't you just shred it?

283
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:01,225
Well, Saddam
owed us money.

284
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:04,126
You didn't realize
that he wouldn't pay?

285
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:06,256
Your mom had a good
feeling about him.

286
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:11,770
<i>So Mom knew this entire time, and shejust</i>
<i>lied to my face for months and months?</i>

287
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:15,603
Let me tell you something, Dad. This is...
This is your problem. Okay? Not mine.

288
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,805
Well, maybe it wouldn't be my problem
if you did what I asked for once in your life...

289
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:23,041
- and you gave Kitty what I asked you to!
- Once in my damn life?

290
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,142
All I've ever done my entire life is do
exactly what you told me to, all right?

291
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:30,246
I've done everything for this family, Pop.
Not anymore. Kitty can have my job.

292
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:32,917
And you can take your own
polygraph test, 'cause I'm done.

293
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:36,120
- I'm done with you,
and I'm done with the business.
- <i>Great.</i>

294
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:40,529
I'm gonna get a lethal injection
because my son won't eat a potato.

297
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:51,367
- So did you swipe the sedative
from the infirmary...
- No!

- to lower your heart rate?
- No! It's okay. I want to do this...

299

I never willfully deceived anyone.

- But I can see clearly now...

<i>let myself down.</i>

- <i>That was not a nod. No.</i>

00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:28,704
- That was not a nod.
- Call an ambulance!

310
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:30,908
[Siren Wailing]

311
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:35,550
- Oh, how is he?
- Stable.

312
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:38,852
But they don't know
if he's due for another one.

313
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,089
It's his own fault. What kind of diet is this?
It's too much meat.

314
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:46,290
I want all of you
off this immediately.

315
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,129
Except you.

316
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,898
<i>Tobias!</i>
<i>I can't believe you came!</i>

317
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:55,031
Oh, come on, Lindsay.
This is my family.

318
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:58,872
<i>[Narrator] And Lindsay realized that</i>
<i>perhaps they did have something left</i>...

319
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,537
<i>a real connection.</i>

320
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:03,207
Also, Dale, one of the gentlemen
from my reading...

321
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:06,149
is a nurse here, so we were able
to park right out front.

322
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:09,921
Oh! Barry.
Did you talk to a doctor?

323
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:12,719
I did.
I have poison oak.

324
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:15,556
Do you believe it?
Where the hell did I get that?

325
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:17,562
<i>[Dog Barks]</i>

326
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:20,394
- She was talking about George.
- No, he's the same.

327
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,402
Look, I guess we should decide who's
gonna speak for the family. I would...

328
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:26,062
but I have Laker tickets.

329
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,072
<i>[Dog Barks]</i>

330
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,074
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Buster knew this was his chance...</i>

331
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:32,110
<i>to put Kitty's coup d'état</i>
<i>in action.</i>

332
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,510
<i>He wondered</i>
<i>ifhe was up for it.</i>

333
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:37,082
Someone might have to sign
the "do not resuscitate" form.

334
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:41,244
- <i>And he decided he wasn't.</i>
- I need to make a telephone call.
Get out of something.

335
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,447
I'm in charge now.

336
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,752
I speak for this family.

337
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:49,454
<i>I mean, l-I could,</i>
<i>if you wanted me to.</i>

338
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:53,260
I'd rather not, obviously.
Don't know what I'd say.

339
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,926
Why do I have to be the one?
I don't need this.

340
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,300
<i>Why does this have to</i>
<i>become my problem? No. I'm out.</i>

341
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:00,532
Forget it. Find somebody else.
I'm sick of it.

342
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,269
- I'm sick of doing everything for this family.
- Where is Michael?

343
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,607
- [Scoffs] Typical.
- Did somebody call him?

344
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,704
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, they hadn't.</i>

345
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,443
<i>And at that moment,</i>
<i>he was determined to finally get...</i>

346
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:13,781
- <i>as far away from his family as possible.</i>
- Hey, pal.

347
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:16,117
- Pack your bags.
- Where are we goin'?

348
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:19,316
Anywhere. Joshua Tree, space camp,
the Baseball Hall of Fame...

349
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:22,953
Everything you and I have always wanted to do
but haven't been able to because of this family.

350
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,793
- We're just gonna go?
- Yeah. And I don't know
if we're even gonna come back.

351
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:28,459
- There's nothing keeping us here.
- Well, Dad...

352
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:32,004
- I like it here.
- What the hell's going on with you lately?

353
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:35,268
I wanted to watch <i>Hindsight,</i>
and you weren't there.

354
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,310
I want to pack up and desert the family,
and you don't want to.

355
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:41,346
- Is it this new girlfriend?
- No, it...

356
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:45,077
It's because of the family.
I like the family.

357
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:48,916
- I mean, if we leave, who's
gonna take care of these people?
- I don't know.

358
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:53,322
The state or the police. Maybe the
Magicians' Alliance will pick up some slack.

359
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:56,361
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Hey. That's gonna be them, and
they're gonna want something.

360
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,590
We're not answering that.

361
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:01,667
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

362
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,539
Hello?

363
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:11,767
- Where's George Michael?
- Exactly. Where is he?

364
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:15,177
Ever since he's been dating this
Annie McNo-face, he's been blowing me off.

365
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,511
- Oh, hey. Where's Pop-Pop?
- Room 212.

366

<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And that's when Maeby decided...</i>

<i>[Narrator]</i>

368
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:24,247
<i>that perhaps she could use her uncle</i>
<i>to make her cousin jealous.</i>

369
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,524
Hey, Dad.
Wait up.

370
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:32,291
That was a waste
of time.

371
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,930
- [Groaning]
- How's he doin'?

372
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:39,198
He's hanging in there.

373
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:41,705
<i>He keeps trying to get this I. V.</i>
<i>out ofhis arm. I don't understand why.</i>

374
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:43,708
<i>It's just glucose.</i>

375
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,210
We're all trying
to stay away from sugar.

376
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:51,745
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Absolutely. Absolutely. You all right?

377
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:54,183
I'll handle
this one, Michael.

378
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:59,088
Don't you worry. It'll take a lot more
than a heart attack to kill that old bear.

379
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,092
[Laughing]
Old bear!

380
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,094
He likes the honey!

381
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:07,731
He never got a chance
to see my bee business take off.

382
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:11,361
Hey, come on, now. Dad's gonna be
around another 30 years, Gob.

383
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,962
Your business,
uh, might not.

384
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:17,772
You're a good brother,
Michael.

00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:21,836
Heart attack never stop
old Big Bear.

386
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:24,940
I didn't even know
we were calling him Big Bear.

387
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:28,919
- We never had a chance to!
- Hey, hey. Come on, Gob.

388
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:33,459
Everybody, I'm very sorry, okay?
I feel awful. I should have been here.

389
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,825
I was the one that was supposed to take that
polygraph test, and then I just turned on him...

390
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,921
<i>and then this happened,</i>
<i>but never again, okay?</i>

391
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:42,433
I will never, ever leave this family,
no matter what.

392
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:47,600
- You should've been here.
- I feel like I covered that.

393

- Well, you didn't say it.
- I feel awful. I should have been here.

394
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:53,372
Maybe you're right. Maybe I didn't
say it. I should have been here.

395
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:58,880
- Excuse me, Mr. Bluth.
- Hmm?

396
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,780
- We lost him.
- [All Gasping]

397
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,347
He just, uh, got away from us.
I'm sorry.

00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:09,822
<i>Uh, can we go in there?</i>

399
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,397
If you want.
Not a lot to see.

400
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,491
Maybe not for you,

<i>The family grapples with the news</i>
<i>they hadjust heard.</i>

00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:56,041
Why would a doctor say he's "gone"

God, I've missed bread.
Mmm.

<i>Maeby's life gets</i>
<i>a little more complicated.</i>

411
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:09,054
It's so obvious. He gave himself the shot
to make it look like a heart attack.

412
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:11,487
- How could they not see that?
- Maybe we should kiss again...

413

about obvious.

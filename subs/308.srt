1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,584
<i>Michael was trying to include
his brother in the business...</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,249
<i>at his father's request...</i>

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,225
So, the last couple of months
have seen us hemorrhaging money...

8
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:32,628
<i>But he was finding himself
overwhelmed by the change.</i>

9
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,064
Is it my turn to speak yet?
I've got a good one.

10
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,864
- We're gonna wait till after lunch for the tricks.
- It's not a trick, Michael.

11
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,769
It's a business opportunity.

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,104
You can turn the music off.
I already shot my wad.

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,109
Off.

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,702
No, that's tape. It's a...

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:51,614
I have got a quick way for us...

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,619
to literally be showered with money.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,588
That's where the penny thing would have...

18
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,725
Bonus. Anyway, it involves
us making some money...

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,389
with our Mexican friends from Colombia.

20
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,295
I think they're called Colombians.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,064
Oh, I forgot. We're being "politically correct."

22
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,005
Anyway, there's a company there that
wants to develop some time-shares with us.

23
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,474
I told them that we'll
sell them our blueprints...

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,774
- for 100 grand.
- Gob, we're prohibited...

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,440
from doing any business outside the
country while we're under investigation.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,575
Translation: "Wish I'd thought of that."

27
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,085
- Nice translating, Dad.
- Oh.

28
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,213
I also had this slogan made up.

29
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,588
"A Colombian cartel that <i>won't</i>
kidnap and kill you."

30
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,321
Underline "won't," 'cause
that makes the competition look like...

31
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,329
- maybe they...
- I'm serious. We're not doing it.

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,696
It's illegal, and, uh, it's also kind
of a stupid way to make a quick buck.

33
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,793
- It's not stupid. You're stupid.
- Nice pout, Dad.

34
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,566
I wasn't calling you stupid.
I was calling the idea stupid.

35
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,574
If you'd spend a little more time
learning about the business...

36
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,837
and less time with the tricks,
you'd know that.

37
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,539
If I didn't have a live dove
in my pants right now...

38
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:58,139
I would leap across this table and...
You know what? Forget it.

39
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,549
- Let's go ahead and take five.
<i>- Michael was frustrated...</i>

40
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,180
<i>and returned to his office to find Lindsay.</i>

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,690
Gob is driving me crazy. I finally
got rid of him for a little while...

42
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,693
and Dad put him
right back in the business.

43
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,695
You two have always fought.

44
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,130
- I think I even have video of that.
- You and half of Orange County.

45
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,965
<i>As children, George Sr. would
often provoke the boys to fight one another.</i>

46
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,971
He's calling you a liar.

47
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,041
I don't want your cards, Michael.

48
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,906
<i>He believed it created a competitive spirit...</i>

49
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,241
<i>which equipped them for the challenges of life.</i>

50
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,247
Let's keep it in frame.

51
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,250
<i>He also believed footage
of the tussles would be a big hit...</i>

52
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,912
<i>in the burgeoning
home video market.</i>

53
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,650
<i>He soon franchised the concept
with such titles...</i>

54
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,159
<i>as</i> Boyfights 2...

55
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,196
A Boyfights Cookout...

56
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:49,098
<i>and</i> Backseat Boyfights:
The Trip to Uncle Jack’s 70th.

57
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,830
- How do you think I feel?
- You weren't even in the tapes.

58
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,339
I was talking about my marriage.
Are we still talking about the tapes?

59
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,170
Apparently not.
What's going on with your marriage?

60
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,839
Well, as you know, Bob Loblaw and I
have had a secret little thing going.

61
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,748
- Very secret. He doesn't know.
- He has not known of it. That's correct.

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,515
But last night he finally
responded to one of my little hints.

63
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,749
- Why won't you!@%$ me?
- Look...

64
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,521
You're an attractive woman, and you've
been dressing like a common whore.

65
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:19,291
- Well, I've been trying. - But you asked
me to represent you in your divorce.

66
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,891
- I can't see a client.
- Then recommend somebody else.

67
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,902
Well, our copy boy is very striking...

68
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,904
but he often has toner on his fingers.

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,873
- I meant another lawyer.
- Oh.

70
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,377
So now I have to tell Tobias we're getting
divorced, break the news to Maeby...

71
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,947
plus fit an eyebrow pluck in there,
all before the weekend.

72
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,574
Perhaps you can talk to Maeby while
you're getting your eyebrows plucked.

73
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,779
It'll look like your eyes
are watering 'cause you're sad.

74
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,482
<i>Later that day Michael
went to his parents’ apartment...</i>

75
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,924
<i>to talk about the problem
he was having with Gob.</i>

76
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,427
- What's going on here?
- They're painting the whole building...

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,555
so I'm having the inside done too.

78
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:57,899
And that goes into storage, right?
Not into your apartment.

79
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,495
What's Spanish for
"I know you speak English"?

80
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,507
Mom, if you're gonna speak
to these guys like this...

81
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,509
you might want to sleep
with one eye open.

82
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,478
Actually, I'll be sleeping at your place.

83
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,277
- Paint fumes are deadly.
- You know Dad's under house arrest here.

84
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,284
It'll be nice to get
a break from him too.

85
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,321
Besides, I certainly
can't recuperate here.

86
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,721
- Recuperate?
- I didn't want to worry anyone.

87
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,284
It's a routine procedure...
Very common for women my age.

88
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,854
I see. The apartment's not
the only thing getting a face lift, huh?

89
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,264
Hope you kept your punch cards.
You're about due for a free one.

90
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,269
- We have to pay for the paint.
- No, no, no.

91
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,362
You're not getting a centavo
until you finish all the work.

92
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,771
You guys are both gonna be
sleeping with your eyes open.

93
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,843
Mom, however, will not have a choice.

94
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,844
Dad, need you to help me get rid of Gob.

95
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,347
- That ship sailed 35 years ago.
- Doesn't know anything about the business.

96
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,883
Today he suggested that we do
an illegal Colombian deal.

97
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,182
- You said that was legal.
- That was your idea?

98
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,316
- I may have mentioned it.
- You told Gob to do it, didn't you?

99
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,326
Did you just want to get us
at each other's throats again...

100
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,295
- like you used to do with the <i>Boyfights</i> videos?
<i>- Boyfights?</i>

101
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,128
<i>- Luchas de Muchachos.</i>
- Oh, sí, <i>Luchas de Muchachos.</i>

102
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,634
- We had this video.
- Sí.

103
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,533
<i>The tapes were a big hit in Latin America.</i>

104
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,868
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with them...

105
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,965
Except for some
of the Baby Buster shorts.

106
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,976
Maybe I was trying
to teach you something.

107
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,978
Maybe I was trying
to teach you how to compete.

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,015
I didn't do it with Buster,
and look how he turned out.

109
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,483
- Is Buster.
- Baby Buster.

110
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,578
"Yo quiero leche.
Yo quiero leche de madre."

111
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,158
Even though I am so old.

112
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,250
Those tapes made quite
an impression on these painters.

113
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,159
I think I turned out
pretty darn well, myself.

114
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,164
Oh, you just turned out great.

115
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,996
I used my contacts
to get you a job, and you quit.

116
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,299
<i>The job was at an Iraqi-owned toy store...</i>

117
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,067
<i>that was hoping
to deter shoplifting.</i>

118
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,168
Okay, I'll just take off
this cheap fake hand...

119
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,907
and we gonna put on this sign.

120
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,074
Beautiful. You like?

121
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,051
They only wanted me because
I had one hand... and I won't do it!

122
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,553
- That's not the way Mother is raising me.
- Like I won't compete...

123
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,615
with my older brother anymore,
despite the way Father raised me.

124
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,595
- We'll show you. - Just like I showed
Mr. Al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat.

125
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,064
I stole this sign.

126
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,362
Of course, I left my hand there also.

127
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,566
<i>But FAO al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat...</i>

128
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,303
<i>wasn't the only one
having trouble scaring kids.</i>

129
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,939
<i>So was Hollywood's third-youngest
movie studio executive, Maeby Fünke.</i>

130
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,950
The creature's in your imagination.

131
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,327
That's the bloodsucker? It looks like Alf.
You got a week to fix it.

132
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,953
This must be the creature that ate our cat.

133
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,496
<i>- And Michael met up with Gob.</i>
- Hey, Gob.

134
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,400
Why didn't you tell me that
Colombian thing was Dad's idea?

135
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,235
Well, Dad said not to
because you don't think I'm smart...

136
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,741
- and that I should take credit for it.
- It was just Dad...

137
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,744
trying to turn us against each other again,
and of course I think you're smart.

138
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,076
Okay? Hey, what's going on
down there? What are you doing?

139
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,241
You don't want a hungry dove
down your pants.

140
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,649
That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut.

141
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,348
Look, I know that I don't know
about this housing stuff...

142
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,823
but I've got this
Christian girlfriend now...

143
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,258
and she's trying to get me
to be a better man...

144
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,262
and reconnect with my son...

145
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,855
and I'm trying to get her
to renounce God and!@%$ me...

146
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,868
and I just want to prove to her
that I'm worth it.

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,961
As always, Gob, a mixed bag there...

148
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,166
but the middle part sounded pretty admirable
for a second, so here's what I want to do.

149
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,540
I want to get you your own
banana stand franchise...

150
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,205
and you can have Steve work at it.

151
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,977
- You'd do that for me?
- Yes. Yeah. You can design your own shack.

152
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,642
- And choose my own location?
- Whatever you want.

153
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,778
You're gonna be 100%
in charge, all right?

154
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,288
But the most important thing
is that we never let Dad...

155
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,293
- turn us against each other again.
- Thanks, Michael.

156
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,834
If you feel something moving
down there, it's just the bird.

157
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,803
I know it.

158
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,841
<i>And a few days later...</i>

159
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,002
<i>Michael got a call from his son.</i>

160
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,875
- Hey, Dad, did you know Gob started
a banana stand? - Yeah, that was my idea.

161
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,677
I'm trying to get us
to be less competitive.

162
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,218
That's gonna be difficult.

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,050
Plus they have a very aggressive slogan.

164
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,794
<i>Gob had opened a new
frozen banana stand, like...</i>

165
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,198
<i>twenty feet from the old
frozen banana stand.</i>

166
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,964
What's going on? You just thought
you'd put the stand right here?

167
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,302
Did the research. Do you know
that more frozen bananas are sold...

168
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,705
right here on this boardwalk
than anywhere in the OC?

169
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,040
- Don't call it that.
- Also gonna need a check, 'cause I kind of went...

170
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,046
out of pocket on the new sign... and
I need some bananas and some chocolate...

171
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,173
- from the other branch. - Just take
the sign down... Take the whole booth down.

172
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,718
You're cannibalizing our business.

173
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,254
You're just scared
of a little "competish."

174
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,586
You guys don't even have bananas,
so I'm not too worried.

175
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,888
In fact, you know what? Me and my son
are gonna kick your little shack's ass.

176
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,327
Dad, it's okay. We can just work
together with them, you know?

177
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,331
That makes sense. I mean, we
don't really even know the recipe.

178
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,891
- You just freeze the banana,
and then you stick it... - Don't tell 'em.

179
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,904
- Stick it in the what?
- No, it's okay. We'll figure it out.

180
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,201
And when we do,
we'll have the last laugh.

181
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,108
We'll be the laughingstock
of the boardwalk.

182
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,841
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay was
preparing for her own competition.</i>

183
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,349
This is Treat. He'll be representing you.

184
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,352
He started off as my paralegal,
but he's a lawyer now.

185
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,184
- Well, as of next Monday.
- Well, we'll fudge that.

186
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,918
Lindsay, just do me one favor.

187
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,824
Don't mention me by name when you
talk about your future plans for dating.

188
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,022
It reflects poorly on me.

189
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,531
Right, right.
The conflict of interest.

190
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,863
Yeah, that too.

191
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,302
- Hello, Lindsay.
- Tobias. Did you get a lawyer?

192
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,206
Only the best-looking and
best-educated lawyer in the whole OC.

193
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,210
- Don't call it that.
- Okay.

194
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,076
- Bob Loblaw. How are you?
- Bob's representing you?

195
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,947
<i>He was. One day earlier,
Tobias had spoken to him...</i>

196
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,885
<i>- on the phone.</i> - Whether or not
those promises were made explicit.

197
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:53,482
You... want me to be explicit?

198
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,493
Anyway, as it turns out...

199
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,826
Bob was offering to be my lawyer.

200
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,831
<i>And that night...</i>

201
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,664
<i>- Buster arrived with a post-op Lucille.</i>
- There she is.

202
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,399
She wants to know where you want to put her.

203
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,634
She can take my room.

204
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,438
She wants to know
if I can sleep there too.

205
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,173
She said that's very important to her.

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,250
All right. I'll meet you
up there, Mother.

207
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,284
You better not lock it!
I'll kick it in!

208
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,690
Oh, by the way. Doctor said
no kissing her on the face for one week.

209
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,854
I was like, "Make it two weeks.
See if I care."

210
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,432
Got a new hand?

211
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,592
Oh, yeah. I'm trying it out.

212
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,932
Guess who I ran into at the prosthetic
shop while I was waiting for Mother.

213
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,938
Sorry, no refunds...

214
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,307
- And that's why you don't take your foot
out of its wrapper. - J. Walter Weatherman.

215
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,210
You're the man who used to scare us
as children, and one time as an adult.

216
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,943
<i>George Sr. had always used him...</i>

217
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,349
<i>to teach his children
lasting lessons.</i>

218
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,856
<i>They usually involved
his prosthetic arm being ripped off.</i>

219
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,794
And that's why you always leave a note.

220
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,832
- You're one of George Bluth's kids.
- Uh-huh.

221
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,460
- I guess you'll be scaring children yourself now.
- As a matter of fact, I won't.

222
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,902
If anything, it
strengthened my resolve...

223
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,406
to be more than just
a one-armed man...

224
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,977
Even if it means me never
taking a job again.

225
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,314
Almost makes it worth it.

226
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,179
- Hello.
<i>- Listen. I heard...</i>

227
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,809
that you gave Gob
a banana stand.

228
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,354
<i>They did great.
He and Steve took in over $700.</i>

229
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,356
- They did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

230
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,892
So I guess the Bluth Company's
got a new heir.

231
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,862
<i>That's when Michael
realized it was time to get serious.</i>

232
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,092
George Michael, do you know
where the banana suit is?

233
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,706
<i>That night,
Maeby, displaced by Buster, heard a noise.</i>

234
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,510
Hello? George Michael?

235
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,014
I'm thirsty.

236
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,278
<i>And Maeby knew she had found
her bloodsucking creature.</i>

237
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,549
<i>The next day, Michael took
off work to man the banana stand...</i>

238
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,890
<i>- while his son manned a banana.</i>
- How you doin' there, champ?

239
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,431
- Is my name champ? It's so hot.
- Why don't you take five?

240
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,796
That's not including the five minutes
it takes to get out of this thing?

241
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,801
- You're not getting out of it.
- Attention, everyone.

242
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,533
Why go to a banana stand when
we can make <i>your</i> banana stand?

243
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,235
I give you Barbara and Dee.

244
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,274
Don't worry. These young beauties have
been nowhere near the bananas.

245
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,283
Dad, are they strippers?

246
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,650
If I know your uncle, they're at least
strippers. I guess we gotta up the ante.

247
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,453
No, Dad. Then they're just gonna up it
and it'll go back and forth all day.

248
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,653
- If that's what it takes, that's what
we're gonna do. <i>- And they did...</i>

249
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,221
<i>But it was less entertaining
than you might imagine...</i>

250
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,098
<i>no matter what music
was put under it.</i>

251
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,011
<i>It was kind of funny
to "Yellow Submarine"...</i>

252
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,920
<i>but who could afford it?</i>

253
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,960
<i>So here's what happened at the end.</i>

254
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,598
- Hey, stop fighting!
- Stop it!

255
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,656
- Hey, stop fighting!
- Stop it!

256
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,326
That's it. They're right, okay? This is insane.
We're just "boyfighting" again.

257
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,427
And for what?
A hefty bag full of pesos.

258
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,599
- You've been taking pesos?
- Dad said I should.

259
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,438
- Dad's involved with this?
- Well, he chose the location...

260
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,446
And the strippers and the sign.
Every part of it, really.

261
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,641
Wait a minute. Don't you see
what's happening here?

262
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,650
Dad's clearly going ahead
with the Colombian deal...

263
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,652
and he's laundering it
through your banana shack.

264
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,779
He pitted us against each other
so I'd be too busy to notice.

265
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,323
Well, you know what? I think it's
time for us to teach Dad a lesson.

266
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,451
Get the person who terrorized us
the most in our childhood.

267
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,020
She's still healing.
Let's get J. Walter Weatherman.

268
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,031
<i>Michael and Gob had decided...</i>

269
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,109
<i>to teach their father a lesson.</i>

270
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,111
- We need the number of the one-armed man.
- I'm not giving you that.

271
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,704
You want to use his disability
to scare someone.

272
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,046
That's everything I'm against.
Read the button, mister!

273
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,853
"The only scary thing about...

274
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,357
a one-armed man trying to
scare someone is the fact that"...

275
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,223
That he feels that his one arm is good
for nothing but trying to scare somebody.

276
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,058
- It's upside down.
- Let's see you try to put a button on...

277
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,291
with this.

278
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,060
Stop screaming.
It's not scary.

279
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,068
I'm gonna get the number myself,
'cause we're not gonna...

280
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,070
go through our lives
being controlled by this guy.

281
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,231
What is more pathetic than grown men
being scared of their father?

282
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,071
- I'm thirsty.
- Oh, my God!

283
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,075
<i>This continued for a while.</i>

284
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,809
<i>And later, Michael and Gob
went to put their plan in action.</i>

285
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,885
I gave the Colombians back
their money, and I told them...

286
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,113
that you had no right
to make the deal.

287
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,155
I have to warn you, though,
they didn't sound too happy.

288
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,725
Let's just hope they don't try to get
even by "cir-sum-venting" the law.

289
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,125
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Kidnap or... Michael said it.

290
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,595
What, are you kidding?
I have an ankle monitor.

291
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,791
I can't even go into the hallway
without the cops coming up.

292
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,801
- Stop it!
- Clearly you know what you're doing.

293
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,066
There's an off chance they might
just want to take you, leave the ankle.

294
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,697
But anyhow...
Stall him.

295
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,606
<i>And Michael
went to solicit help for the lesson.</i>

296
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,906
How would you and some
of your friends like to help us...

297
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,982
teach Mr. Bluth a lesson?

298
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,982
Maybe pose as Colombians.

299
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,575
But we are Guatemalan.
Won't he know the difference?

300
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,247
I think anything south
of San Diego will be just fine.

301
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,587
- Orlando was in the Groundlings.
- Just classes.

302
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,253
Is it going to be unscripted, like <i>Curb?</i>

303
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,264
<i>George Sr., meanwhile,
had grown suspicious of his sons.</i>

304
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,596
What was that with Michael just now?

305
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,603
He wants to teach you a lesson.

306
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,832
- What kind of lesson?
- J. Walter Weatherman lesson.

307
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,501
He's gonna fake your kidnapping
and helicopter ride to Colombia.

308
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,511
He's gonna teach me a lesson
using my own scare toy?

309
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,945
Weatherman wouldn't do it.
I think Buster turned him.

310
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,949
Yeah, well, he'll say yes for me.

311
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,111
We'll go along with his lesson, but
we're gonna teach him one of our own...

312
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,678
But it's gotta be a secret, okay?
Between a dad and his...

313
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,521
His favorite son.

314
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,999
- Don't worry, Pop. Gob Bluth doesn't cave.
- Yeah, you just did for me.

315
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,535
- Well, you asked me to so I thought...
- Okay, go, go, go. It's fine.

316
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,868
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias
were back with the arbitrator.</i>

317
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,908
As you know, it is very difficult...

318
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,069
to establish fault in a divorce,
but one indicator is fidelity.

319
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,876
My client has not pursued sex
outside of this marriage.

320
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,178
- Nor in it.
- I got this one.

321
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,310
- Can the same be said for you?
- Oh, absolutely.

322
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,253
- I've done everything to make this marriage work.
- That's interesting.

323
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,825
Can you tell me what your
plans are for this evening?

324
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,724
Uh, I have plans with a friend.

325
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,559
- A man? What's his name, please?
- Don't answer that.

326
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,725
I withdraw the question.
Why don't we stop for the day?

327
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,860
So <i>Mrs.</i> Fünke...

328
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,938
can get to her date
with her mysterious...

329
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,507
Mr. Blah-blah-blah.

330
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,543
At 8:30, unless you want
to sit at the bar.

331
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,839
<i>It was the first time
someone took Tobias's side...</i>

332
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,678
<i>- and he wanted to thank him.</i>
- As much as I hate losing Lindsay and everything...

333
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,082
I feel like I'm making
a friend in you...

334
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,711
so I was wondering if maybe
tonight you just want to...

335
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,722
take in a movie... or a <i>schvitz...</i>

336
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,883
or just stay in and nest.

337
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:11,053
Actually, I was going to stay in my
office tonight and work on my law blog.

338
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,529
Of course...
The Bob Loblaw Law Blog.

339
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,692
Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful.

340
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:21,205
<i>While Tobias was trying
to get his mouth around Bob Loblaw...</i>

341
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,742
<i>Maeby was showing Mort Meyers
a monster of her own.</i>

342
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,743
Oh, that's terrifying.

343
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,972
Who did that for you,
Industrial Light & Magic?

344
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,879
- Topelson Plastic and Silicone.
- Did he do <i>Land of the Dead?</i>

345
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,544
Yeah. He's been
in Beverly Hills for years.

346
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,281
- Get our makeup people on it.
<i>- And George Sr. waited...</i>

347
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,324
<i>for the fake kidnapping
he knew Michael had orchestrated.</i>

348
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,920
- Don't move!
- Hey, well, let's do it.

349
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,931
Get into the box, old man.

350
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,933
Oh, blankets. That's...
Who thought of that?

351
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,469
- That is very nice.
- Come on, get in the trunk!

352
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,971
What about...
What about my ankle monitor?

353
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,338
We have an ankle monitor deactivator.

354
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,343
Oh, good. See, I've been
meaning to get one of those.

355
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,176
I'm not gonna resist you guys because,
you know, I don't want you to beat me.

356
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,307
<i>But the mistreated painters...</i>

357
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,476
<i>were actually looking forward to that part.</i>

358
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,050
Oh! Forgot my iPod.

359
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,692
- Start the helicopter!
<i>- And so Michael, believing himself...</i>

360
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,929
<i>to be aided by Gob, set to work.</i>

361
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,302
<i>But this too produced
less-than-compelling footage.</i>

362
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,214
<i>And this is how that ended.</i>

363
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,115
Put on the sound effects.
Put on the sound effects.

364
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,211
CD... CD one. CD one.

365
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,052
Track two. Track two.

366
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,353
Put the hostage here by the ottoman.

367
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,553
Get it out of here.
What's it doing in here?

368
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,495
- Ottoman out.
<i>- And George Sr. was released...</i>

369
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,568
<i>- from his long journey into the living room.</i>
- Where am I?

370
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,899
- Colombia. Where do you think?
- And you just missed the last train...

371
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,496
that will come through
the jungle for three days.

372
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,576
- He's good.
- He's a Groundling.

373
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,371
You have betrayed us,
and we will make you pay...

374
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,743
- and then we will go back for your sons.
- My sons? No.

375
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,147
They too will suffer
for your terrible decisions.

376
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,186
And you should really
pay your workers what they deserve...

377
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,187
not make them have to buy
their own supplies.

378
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,086
Not just the painting.
The sanding too.

379
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,819
Yeah, and the taping
is very time-consuming.

380
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,693
<i>Michael decided
his father was ready to learn his lesson.</i>

381
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,526
- And that is why...
- He's got a gun!

382
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,029
I can't let you do it! Get away!

383
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,734
Get away. I'll shoot. I will, I will.
I'll take you all out.

384
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,672
- This is all fake. These guys are painters.
- I will, I will!

385
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:41,337
- Oh, God! My arm.
- Dad, you just shot off this guy...

386
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,346
This guy's arm.

387
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,441
And that's why you don't
teach your father a lesson.

388
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,114
Who's the stupid one now?
Thank you, Gob.

389
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,522
Gob? You told him?
I thought we were a team.

390
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,062
- It's not fun feeling stupid, is it?
- You son of a...

391
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,699
- Wait a minute. I gotta get my camera.
- Get off of me!

392
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,201
What is all this?
What's going on?

393
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,363
Keep it in frame.
You wanna... Cheat out.

394
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,531
- I will kill you!
- I'm gonna kill you.

395
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,541
- You're going out of frame.
- I'll kill you.

396
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,735
No!

397
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,109
Oh, my God! Michael!

398
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,982
Dad... It was an accident. I'm sorry.

399
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,715
And that's why you don't pit
Gob and me against each other.

400
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,553
- Yes! Yeah!
- Gob.

401
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,559
- You set me up.
- That's right.

402
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,392
- No more "boyfights."
- J. Walter Weatherman was in on it too?

403
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,762
- Right from the very start.
- So you did use him.

404
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,961
Look at this place.
Look at my home.

405
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,303
- Freeze! Drop the gun. - It's okay.
We're just trying to teach this guy a lesson.

406
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,105
- Drop the gun!
- Oh, my good hand!

407
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,237
<i>Buster's good hand just came...</i>

408
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,680
flying off.

409
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:56,777
And that's why you don't use a
one-armed person to scare someone.

410
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,652
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

411
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,194
<i>Maeby finds a way
to scare an entire generation.</i>

412
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,993
<i>This Christmas, terror has a new face.</i>

413
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,092
I'm thirsty.

<i>Gangy.</i>

415
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,666
We should start production
on <i>Gangy Two.</i>

416
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,675
Well, I know she
wanted a skin peel.

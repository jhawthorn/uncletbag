00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:13,952
NARRATOR: <i>Gob Bluth had just</i>
<i>been told by his father</i>

2
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:16,371
<i>to go to work</i>
<i>for his younger brother.</i>

3
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,165
And then thanks
for the birthday card

4
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:21,292
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:23,128
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact,</i>

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,172
<i>- it was a brother with whom</i>
<i>Gob...</i>-What the hell?

7
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:26,381
- (horns honking)
<i>- ...was secretly competitive.</i>

8
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:27,674
MICHAEL:
I got the right of way.

9
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:30,093
- GOB: N-No.
- MICHAEL: Okay. (laughs)

10
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:33,722
NARRATOR: <i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>that sense of competition...</i>

11
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:36,349
(tires screeching, horn honking)

12
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,476
<i>...that led</i>
<i>to this tinkling match.</i>

13
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,311
GOB:
<i>I've met someone.</i>

14
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:43,023
Can't really give you any
information-- kind of famousy.

15
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:44,691
- I also met someone.
- Have you?

16
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,902
Also famousy.
Can't give<i>you</i>any information.

17
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:49,404
- Is it Julie Bowen?
- No, it's not.

18
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,073
- Is yours Julie Bowen?
- Is yours Julie...?

19
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,825
Oh, my God, Michael,
you're seeing Julie Bowen?

20
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,077
I am not seeing Julie Bowen,

21
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,287
but if you are,
you tell me right now.

22
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:00,040
I want to hear you say the words
"I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."

23
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:02,209
I have not seen Julie Bowen.

24
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,668
Well, that's a funny way
to phrase it.

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,503
NARRATOR:
<i>This went on for some time,</i>

26
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,215
<i>but eventually</i>
<i>they started talking business.</i>

27
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,259
If it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,467
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

29
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,136
- to bring the people in.
- (squawk)

30
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,513
- Lindsay.<i>-But soon the hard</i>
<i>lemonade softened</i>

31
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,266
<i>- their competitive edge.</i>
- No, no, this-- maybe Tobias.

32
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:18,808
<i>And Michael confessed</i>

33
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,854
<i>that he had grown estranged</i>
<i>from his son.</i>

34
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,189
I'll call him for you.

35
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,275
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

36
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:28,110
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

37
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,737
You know, when I said that, that
these places sell themselves,

38
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:34,574
I should have gone on to say,
you know, that, that, uh...

39
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,159
No, they don't.

40
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,494
No, I'm not talking
about selling these mausoleums.

41
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:40,747
I mean destroying Tony Wonder.

42
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,125
I'm gonna destroy his career the
same way that he destroyed mine.

43
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,585
NARRATOR: <i>Gob was referring</i>
<i>to an escape act</i>

44
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:47,462
<i>he'd performed that had failed</i>

45
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,214
<i>when the hidden compartment</i>
<i>that held</i>

46
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,716
<i>the keys to his escape</i>
<i>hadn't opened...</i>

47
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:52,884
- It's not going to work.
<i>- ...humiliating him</i>

48
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,303
<i>in front of his bride...</i>

49
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,638
<i>- uh, her...</i>
- He's not coming back.

50
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,723
<i>...and all of Christendom.</i>

51
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,226
Destroying Tony Wonder is
your sense of purpose?

52
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:02,769
I thought you said,
thanks to me...

53
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,062
Because he's performing
at a gay club tonight,

54
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,480
and I need you to act as
my boyfriend

55
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,522
to help me get in.

56
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,358
I'm gonna say no, thank you.

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,026
And don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

58
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,486
I am your brother.

59
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,280
You sound like my son.

60
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:16,366
NARRATOR: <i>Whom Gob had spoken to</i>
<i>earlier that day.</i>

61
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,743
<i>- And in a van, by the way.</i>
- Hey, you remembered.

62
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:23,081
(chuckles) How about you and I
go to a magic show together?

63
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:24,333
(laughing):
I love magic, of course.

64
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:26,335
I mean, my dad's a magician.

65
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:30,088
- Well, you're my dad, I mean,
so, so you should know. -Right.

66
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,842
Well, it'd be sort of a, a
father-son thing at a gay club.

67
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,677
Well, technically gay night
at a magic club.

68
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,220
Hey, you know what'd be funny?

69
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:38,972
If you pretended
to be my boyfriend

70
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:40,140
so I could lock
this guy Tony Wonder...

71
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:41,975
You know, I-I don't know,

72
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:44,602
I-I don't think this whole thing
is sounding like a good idea.

73
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,938
Besides, last time we tried
to do something together,

74
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,523
- you didn't even show up.
- You know what?

75
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,859
You're mad at me--
I get it, I totally get it,

76
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,695
- and guess what--
I'm mad at you. -You know, Dad,

77
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:56,198
that attitude might be
why you're alone all the time.

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,283
- The way you treat people...
- What about you?

79
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,910
I didn't hear from you
for your entire childhood,

80
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,662
and then thanks
for the birthday card

81
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:07,000
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

82
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,584
NARRATOR:
<i>This was extra hard for Steve</i>

83
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:10,753
<i>to hear on his actual birthday.</i>

84
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:12,088
And didn't you already try
locking Tony Wonder in

85
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,882
- his trick?
- Oh, yeah, but that

86
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,800
wasn't for revenge,
that was just on spec.

87
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:18,761
- Just like Tony Wonder.
<i>- And it didn't work.Besides,</i>

88
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:20,847
that's before I knew that
he had locked me in my trick.

89
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,141
You still don't know that he
tried to lock you in your trick.

90
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:25,060
Hey, I do know, I have proof.

91
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:29,772
I went in that cave
and I found this.

92
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:31,358
We both know
what that stands for.

93
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,401
Jesus.

94
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:33,526
No, that would be a "J."

95
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:34,944
This is a "T."

96
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:37,030
Tony Wonder was there
in the cave the night

97
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,282
that I did my big illusion,
so when I went yesterday

98
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:41,284
to the cave and I saw
that this had wedged

99
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:44,204
my compartment door shut,
I knew that I'd been wronged.

100
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:45,496
Okay, the only thing
that we know

101
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:48,124
is that you tried to
lock Tony Wonder

102
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,084
in his trick first.

103
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,377
- Right?
- No,

104
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,669
- no.
- So you're even.

105
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,296
Because mine didn't work.

106
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:55,257
He got the last laugh,
which, in this case, happened

107
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:56,716
to be the first laugh.
I don't understand

108
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,093
why you can't seem to follow me

109
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,886
- on any of this.
- Gob, you've got a chance

110
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:02,389
to build a brand-new life.
Don't run away from it again.

111
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:04,433
- Don't try to escape it.
- I don't do that, Michael.

112
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,268
Listen, if you insist
on speaking to me like you're

113
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:08,603
my wife, then don't be surprised
to find my (bleep) in you

114
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:10,646
and then you never hear
from me again.

115
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,899
(sighs)
I'm offering you a good job

116
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:16,111
selling good homes,
making real good money,

117
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:20,740
and I'm not asking
for anything in return.

118
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,617
What is this?

119
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm asking for a little
something in return.

120
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,287
These-- this is for the movie.

121
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,038
This is for your life rights
in perpetuity,

122
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,040
in the known universe
and beyond.

123
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,833
Blah, blah, blah, look at this.

124
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,710
What's that mean--
you're not gonna sign it?

125
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,254
No, I was just thinking

126
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,798
that I should have my attorney
Bob Loblaw look at this.

127
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh, he doesn't need to-- it's
all pretty boilerplate stuff.

128
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:39,884
Yeah, no, I'm fine with it.

129
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,677
I'm gonna be in a movie.

130
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:42,845
- (laughs)
- No, you're not.

131
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,265
I'm gonna be in a movie. Okay.

132
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,975
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

133
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:50,645
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

134
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,314
<i>and the one son</i>

00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:54,190
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

136
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,238
<i>It's Gob's</i>
Arrested Development.

137
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,993
<i>Gob was making good</i>
<i>on a promise</i>

138
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:06,828
<i>- he had made to Michael...</i>
- GEORGE MICHAEL: Hi, Uncle Gob.

139
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,788
I need to see you tonight.

140
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,666
<i>- ...to talk to his son.</i>
- It's about your father and you.

141
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:14,002
Really, is... is he upset?

142
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,087
(over phone):
Do I seem like a clown to you?

143
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,464
I got it.

144
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,174
Do I seem like some kind
of a clown to you?

145
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,176
Look, I got it, I got it,
Uncle Gob, just tell me where.

146
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:24,012
Meet me tonight
at the Gothic Castle.

147
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,430
I will-- the Gothic Castle?

148
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,015
No, the Gothicassle.
Yes, the Gothic Castle.

149
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,683
No, I didn't say
the Gothicassle.

150
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:30,560
What, what do you think,
they call it the Gothicassle?

151
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,894
No, I said the Gothic Castle.

152
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,522
- It's the Gothic Castle.
- Gothic Castle.

153
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:34,730
Okay.

154
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:37,359
TAILOR:
I think you look amazing.

155
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,901
I'll take it.

156
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,236
- Great.
- No, no.

157
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:43,198
The compliment, not the shirt.

158
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,492
NARRATOR: <i>And so it was</i>
<i>a very worried George Michael</i>

159
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:48,953
<i>that arrived to speak to</i>
<i>his uncle at the Gothic Castle,</i>

160
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,913
<i>which, that night,</i>
<i>did actually kind of resemble</i>

161
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,207
<i>the Gothicassle.</i>

162
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,417
- Uncle Gob.
- Don't call me Unc...

163
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,918
Actually, no, that's good,
that works here.

164
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,628
Is my dad upset?
What's going on?

165
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,422
- No, he's fine. -But you told me
he was really upset

166
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,257
- about something.
- I don't know.

167
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,634
I do know that your daddy
wants you to get

168
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,011
your hot, little, tight,
little, hot ass

169
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:06,846
right up there right away
to see him.

170
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,723
- BOUNCER: You're good. -You,
you had me come all the way here

171
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:10,392
just to tell me
my dad wants me to meet him?

172
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,227
No, no, those two things
are unrelated.

173
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,312
No, I'm, I'm here 'cause
I'm trying to lock this guy Tony

174
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:15,813
into this gay magic trick,

175
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,233
and I just needed
a believable arm candy bean.

176
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,276
And don't make that face;
you look homophobic.

177
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,070
- No, I'm not being homophobic.
- Why are you doing this?

178
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,821
- I'm, I'm uncomfortable.
- This is very important for me.

179
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,698
Don't worry, you're blending in
here perfectly.

180
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,657
A newbie.

181
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,701
(chuckles)
Except,

182
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,161
even if he does post that
somewhere,

183
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,496
the Fakeblock thing
will scrub it away.

184
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,289
You know about Fakeblock?

185
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:35,250
You know, that's my software.

186
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,335
I wonder if my dad thinks
I'm blowing him off

187
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,379
because that's starting
to take off now.

188
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,548
Well, you should go find out
'cause I do know that your dad

189
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,592
is really, really,
really upset with you.

190
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,427
He is upset?
I asked you that.

191
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,720
That was literally
the first thing I asked you.

192
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,598
You're giving me these craz...

193
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,140
- Mad?
- N...

194
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:53,017
- God, what is that inky taste?
- It's my stamp.

195
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,644
- Oh, I'm so sorry about that.
- No, that-that's okay.

196
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:56,896
I probably won't come back in.

197
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,898
I-I'm gonna go see my dad.

198
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,650
Yeah, you are
'cause you're a good son.

199
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,278
Ow!

200
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,238
- Bit my tongue, that little
bitch.<i>-Oh, no, he didn't.</i>

201
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,574
- They're always doing that.
<i>- I mean, oh, no, he didn't.</i>

202
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:09,867
Thank you, George Michael;
honestly I owe you big-time.

203
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,994
Not a lot of nephews
would do this for their uncles.

204
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,246
Now get out of here.

205
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,457
I never want to sleep
with you again.

206
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,125
I mean, I probably will.
(whispers): I don't.

207
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,585
But are we good?

208
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,253
- We're good.
<i>- After successfully looking</i>

209

<i>like he'd had a fight</i>

<i>Gob put his plan into action.</i>

211
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:28,094
Knowing that Tony would go
into the closet

212
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,054
and pop out of somewhere else,

213
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:32,974
Gob proceeded to lock
everything he could find.

214
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,937
Who's the dumbwaiter now?

216
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,859
<i>back to a moment when his life</i>

"Don't talk to us," they said.

00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:17,727
"Keep your hands to yourself,"
they also said.

228
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:22,148
Magic is only for straight men.

TONY: I don't want
to look at you, son.

232
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:33,868
Just go to work.

233
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,706
Why can't you be
like your brother?

234
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,336
There! Stay in there!

- We don't want you out here!

236

Well, I'm here,
I'm queer, and now...

237
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,011
I'm in a chair!

238
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:54,430
- Did somebody say Wonder?
- (audience cheering)

239
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,057
NARRATOR:
<i>Nobody actually did that time,</i>

240
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,892
<i>but I think</i>
<i>he got away with it.</i>

241
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,478
Didn't expect to see you here.
Want to get a drink later?

242
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,897
<i>And believe it or not,</i>
<i>it was this trick...</i>

243
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,566
Now everybody's gay!

244
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,984
<i>...that really brought</i>
<i>the crowd to their feet.</i>

245
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,446
<i>Although it was pretty easy</i>
<i>to figure out how he did it.</i>

246
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,906
<i>They started out gay.</i>

247
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,824
You missed your cue!

248
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,993
<i>Gob was having a drink</i>
<i>with a man</i>

249
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:17,787

00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:21,249
Beanbag chair-- I was wondering
what you were gonna pop out of.

251
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,751
Did somebody say Wonder...

252
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,419
...ing?

253
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,713
I always try to stay one step
ahead of the audience.

254
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:27,756
<i>Vamanos!</i>

255
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,552
Oh, hey, come on, man.

256
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:33,886
Timing, right?

257
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,012
Hey, leave the mask.

258
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,264
Yeah, of course-- mask.

259
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:37,599
Yeah, that makes sense.

260
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,267
I use a mask myself, in my act.

261
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,936
But you have to tell me how
you do that bean bag trick.

262
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,979
Well, I guess,
since you're a magician, too.

263
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,106
But not a word of this.

264
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:47,316
(whispering):
I did use a mask.

265
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:48,526
I put it on another guy,

266
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:49,944
and then I was
in the bean bag chair

267
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,028
the whole time.

268
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,614
Oh, well, that's... that's...

269
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,323
(whispering): ...that's why
they put that sign

270
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,367
on the bean bag chair that says,
"Do not steal this..."

271
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,244
<i>And the magicians</i>
<i>shared the secrets</i>

272
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:00,079
<i>of their ancient</i>
<i>and mystical craft.</i>

273
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,039
TONY (whispering): And also
it's very hard to get out of

00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,916
(normal volume):
at the end, when I appear.

275
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,376
So how have you been?

276
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,129
I haven't seen you
since your "wedding,"

277
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,631
when you did the Jesus gag.

278
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:11,591
See, it's like a quotation mark,
but with a "W."

279
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,092
Oh, yeah, right, I got ya.

280
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,803
That's... I should do that.

281
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:15,928
Hey, don't. Okay?

282
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,264
I-I... I won't.

283
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,725
Yeah, uh, no, the marriage
was unsuccessful.

284
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,770
I guess you could say
I was a runaway groom.

285
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:25,605
Well, makes sense now,
doesn't it?

286
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:26,815
What do you mean?

287
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:27,898
Well, I mean,
you are gay, right?

288
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,776
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

289
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:32,194
Very... because of
what I'm... dressed...

290
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:33,655
And my boyfriend
was here earlier.

291
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,114
And-and he bit my tongue.

292
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,907
<i>And that's when Gob did</i>

293
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:38,242
<i>a magic trick of his own.</i>

294
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,994
- Want to see?
- No, I believe you.

295
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,287
I'm just surprised, though,

296
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,331
because you are
the Christian magician.

297
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,708
Although you did look awfully
shredded on that cross.

298
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,126
You should have seen me

299
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,670
when they took me
out of the storage locker.

300
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,589
- Hmm. -But how'd I get in
the storage locker?

301
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,007
That's okay;
I know it didn't work.

302
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:54,634
Made the "Woops" column
in<i>Poof.</i>

303
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:56,803
<i>It's cool, though, man;</i>
<i>I've been there.</i>

304
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:57,970
<i>Your assistant probably</i>
<i>sabotaged you.</i>

305
00:10:58,012 --> 00:10:59,514
I don't even use one anymore.

306
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:00,682
I resorted to using my own legs

307
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,391
in the
"Saw the Lady in Half" gag.

308
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,685
I even shaved them.

309
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,936
Want to feel?

310
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:07,188
Wow, they are smooth.

311
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,023
Like a lady's.

312
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:10,692
I think.

313
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,318
(laughing)

314
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,028
You're funny.

315
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,864
- Too bad we can't do this more.
- Why?

316
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,072
I don't know if it'd be

317
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:18,491
great for my reputation
to be seen

318
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,618
with the fundamentalist
Christian magician.

319
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,205
<i>And he was suspicious that Gob</i>
<i>might not actually be gay.</i>

320
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,624
MAN: Valet is closing.
The Cabriolet--

321
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,293
- license plate: "ANUS TART."
- That's me.

322
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,170
Aw, what the hell,
let's do it.

323
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,215
<i>And that's when Gob came up</i>
<i>with a new revenge plan.</i>

324
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:35,633
Yeah, let's risk it.

325
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:36,801
Right? Let's risk it!

326
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,302
Come on.

327
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,600
<i>The next day, Gob shared</i>
<i>his new plan with Tobias.</i>

328
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:45,976
Good. Seems like
you're done talking.

329
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,645
I, too, am in a relationship,

330
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,314
but mine is purely
a revenge-based deal.

331
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,692
Plan on making this person
fall in love with me

332
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:55,319
and then destroying them
by breaking their heart.

333
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,071
How do you make someone
fall in love with you?

334
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:59,114
- Can you pass the mustard,
please? -Yeah.

335
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:00,742
Oh, it's easy when
you've got so much in common.

336
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,243
Last night, for instance,

337
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:03,745
we both got a case
of the munchies,

338
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,705
and then we went out
and we stole these pies...

339
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:09,751
<i>As it turns out, they did</i>
<i>a lot more than steal pies.</i>

340
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,588
<i>They had a raucous good time.</i>

341
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,047
And then the candy
bean dish right here,

342
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,424
we made those
at "Color Me Mine,"

343
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:17,926
and I know they're
kind of cockeyed,

344
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,886
but they remind us both
of my crooked smile.

345
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:22,012
Sounds like you're really
into this girl.

346
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:23,765
Don't call me girl, friend.

347
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:25,641
No, this is purely
an act of revenge,

348
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,936
filled with white-hot hate.

349
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:30,772
I'd tell you on who, but this
person is sort of a celebrity.

350
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:31,856
Oh!

351
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,024
Well, turns out my femme fatale

352
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,443
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

353
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:37,278
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Gob found a solution</i>

354
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,154
<i>to filling one of the houses.</i>

355
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,740
...I've been looking
for a place to live.

356
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,283
That's great.
When can you move in?

357
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:43,993
Uh, duh! Now!

358
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,662
Oh, the other sex offenders
are going to be so jealous.

359
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,498
Wait a minute...

360
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,585
you know of other people
with similar needs?

361
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,420
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he filled the rest.</i>

362
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:56,171
Oh, I have a list of men

363
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:58,758
that could fill
every opening you have.

364
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,051
(coughing)

365
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:03,137
(laughs, coughs)

366
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:05,556
Let me get a shot of mustard.

367
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,600
That was all cheese,
but no mustard.

368
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,351
<i>Not wanting</i>
<i>to appear desperate,</i>

369
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:13,063
<i>Gob waited till late afternoon</i>
<i>to continue his plan</i>

370
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:14,774
<i>to make Tony</i>
<i>fall in love with him.</i>

371
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:16,525
TONY (recorded):
It's Tony.

372
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:20,112
I'm not here right now,
because I'm right behind you.

373
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,864
Made you look.

374
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:23,407
But how did I know you looked?

375
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,034
Because I'm right behind you!

376
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,913
Made you look again.

377
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,205
Tony, it's Gob.

378
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,583
Man, does anybody
ever fall for that?

379
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,753
Listen, uh, I was just,
I was thinking about you--

380
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,797
what a fun night
we had the other night.

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,882
So just call me
when you get a chance.

382
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:41,843
Okay? All right.

383
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,845
(ringtone plays)

384
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:44,929
Wow, that was fast,
you hot little...

385
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:46,639
- It's your mother.
- Hi.

386
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,474
Sorry, I thought you were
somebody else.

387
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,810
I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm
dating someone famous.

388
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:53,395
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was given a new job.</i>

389
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,397
You better start
to build this wall, pronto.

390
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,026
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

391
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,028
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was told to make it</i>

392
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,863
(with Lucille):
<i>...look like major construction</i>

393
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,155
<i>had begun on the wall.</i>

394
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:06,367
<i>So Gob set out to find a crew.</i>

395
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,910
(men shouting)

396
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:11,121
- (feedback screeching)
- Who wants to... (screaming)

397
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:12,414
Hurt my ears.

398
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:15,043
Who wants
to help me build a wall...

399
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,461
to keep Mexicans out of America?

400
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,254
(bleep)
All right, all right!

401
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:20,339
(men shouting in Spanish)

402
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,799
Who wants to help me

403
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,175
build a wall for no reason?

404
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:25,135
It's a different wall.

405
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:26,178
(men shouting, cursing)

406
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,347
- (bleep)
- (men shouting angrily)

407
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,682
(bleep)

408
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:30,808
(Gob shouting,
feedback screeching)

409
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,227
Aah! This thing is loud!

410
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,855
<i>And so he decided to head</i>
<i>to the border ribbon</i>

411
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:37,690
<i>to put in some</i>
<i>manual labor himself.</i>

412
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,149
GOB: ...show everyone
that I'm not afraid of

413
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:42,277
the sweet sting of sweat
in my eyes.

414
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,823
<i>...when he came across</i>
<i>a local maca picker.</i>

415
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,825
You need help to make
your sign stand up?

416
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,451
Yes. No!

417
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,996
I need to find some Mexicans
to help build this wall.

418
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,455
Hey, you know what?

419
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:54,665
You should get the Chinese
to build your wall.

420
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:55,666
We make great walls.

421
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,667
That would be great.

422
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,002
How can we make that happen?

423
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,128
I'm Chinese; I know all Chinese.

424
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,504
I hook you up.

425
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:01,881
- Well, that's, uh...
- (ringtone playing)

426
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,591
That'd be... great.

427
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:05,175
Would you get off
my (bleep), Mother!

428
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:07,511
Well, if I wasn't sure
you were gay, I am now.

429
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,805
It's Tony. Hey, Tony.

430
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,390
Sorry I couldn't
talk last night,

431
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,935
but, uh, I'd really love
to get together later.

432
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:16,311
This week,
or maybe Saturday, say, 5:00?

433
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:17,980
- Great.
- I'm thinking Little Ballroom.

434
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:20,274
Little Ballroom good?
Or you sick of Little Ballroom?

435
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,944
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

436
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:24,528
That was Tony.
My friend Tony.

437
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,739
Oh, she sounds wonderful.

438
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,324
No... no...
I'm gonna get revenge on him

439
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,077
and destroy his life.

440
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,494
Her life.

441
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:34,830
Our... life.

442
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:36,958
Destroy our life.

443
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,334
Destroy our life.

444
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:40,795
That doesn't matter.
Who cares?

445
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:43,131
<i>But Tony Wonder</i>
<i>had a secret, too.</i>

446
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:44,632
We're on.

447
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,550
And he definitely thinks
you're gay, right?

448
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,218
Don't worry, the only thing I'm
better at than (bleep)-ing women

449
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,138
is pretending I'm gay.

450
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,973
Trust me, I am all man.

451
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:53,975
Give me a little leg shave?

452
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,559
All right, well,
you have to be careful.

453
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:56,602
If Gob finds out
you're straight,

454
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,395
he'll use it to ruin you,

455
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,565
and I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

456
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,358
to re-brand you
as the gay magician.

457
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,736
<i>It seemed Sally Sitwell</i>
<i>had a secret also.</i>

458
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,404
I know that.

459
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,823
Why are you telling me all this?

460
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:11,117
'Cause if she finds out,
we both go down.

461
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,868
And I don't want
to have to sell that closet

462
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,662
as a sweat sauna on Craigslist.

463
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,454
- Ow!
- Ooh. Sorry.

464
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,039
It's fine.

465
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,082
And as long as we're recapping

466
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,917
things that we already know,

467
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,293
an inside source tells me

468
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:24,130
he's my ticket
to Internet billions.

469
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,422
Inside source?

470
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:26,340
Oh, I didn't tell you that?

471
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:27,508
- No.
- That's new?

472
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:30,427
It's "in the bag."

473
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,888
<i>Tony made that sound</i>
<i>a lot cooler than it was.</i>

474
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,973
That Fakeblock thing will
scrub it away.

475
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,057
You know about Fakeblock?

476
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,892
You know, that's my software.

477
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,560
I wonder if my dad thinks...

478
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:41,105
<i>It took a lot of restraint</i>
<i>for Tony to not pop out</i>

480

guy sitting on me.

483
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:51,740
<i>Once I get him alone,</i>
<i>I get into his phone,</i>

484
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:53,325
get his boyfriend's information,

485
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:56,078
hack into his software

486
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,329
Ow!

487
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,331
How do you not know how
to shave a leg?

488
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,083
I've never done it before.

489
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:08,966
Anyway, he's halfway to falling
in love with me already.

490
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:12,594
I mean, he actually sounded
excited about seeing me tonight.

491
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:15,514
Poor guy doesn't realize
I'm about to destroy our life.

492
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,933
Our life?

493
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,811
I mean,
destroy our life with Gob.

494
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:25,983

00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:56,805
and that weird fuzzy moth
in the drain...

508
00:17:56,847 --> 00:18:00,101
NARRATOR: <i>It seemed Sally</i>
<i>had two secrets.</i>

509
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:06,148
<i>And days later,</i>
<i>Gob was feeling pretty good.</i>

510
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,693
<i>China Garden had come through</i>
<i>with a crew to build the wall,</i>

511
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:12,280
<i>and with the help of</i>
<i>a well-placed ad,</i>

512
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:16,408
<i>he'd successfully filled all</i>
<i>the homes in Sudden Valley.</i>

513
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,411
<i>And he was on his way to</i>
<i>a hot date with Tony Wonder.</i>

514
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:22,206
Siri, where is
the Little Ballroom?

515
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:23,916
SIRI:
I have three matches.

516
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,086
(mumbles):
I'm going to need the gayest.

517
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:28,712
Did you say the "grayest"?

518
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,422
(snickering)

519
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:32,216
I need the, uh, gayest one.

520
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:33,884
SIRI:
Did you say the "grayest"?

521
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:35,219
I need the gayest
Little Ballroom!

522
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,888
SIRI:
Okay, Gob, try this one.

523
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:42,684
I've got to tell Michael
that I saw another map car.

524
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:44,394
He's gonna be blown away.

525
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:46,230
GOB:
<i>You don't see them a lot.</i>

526
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,898
<i>- Well...</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

527
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,817
...looks like he's turning
into a parking lot.

528
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:52,444
My Little Ballroom.
Of course, yeah.

529
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,071
<i>She's got a kid,</i>
<i>he's acting like</i>

530
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:55,864
<i>he's Father of the Year</i>
<i>or something.</i>

531
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,407
<i>I bet he's pretending</i>
<i>Steve Holt is, like, nine.</i>

532
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:59,034
<i>I just saw him,</i>
<i>he looks 50.</i>

533
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,661
NARRATOR:
<i>But of course Gob was</i>

534
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:02,746
<i>at the wrong Little Ballroom.</i>

535
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,123
I do not get this lifestyle.

536
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:06,041
- Gob?
- You're mistaken.

537
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,169
Hi, there.

538
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,171
- Michael.
- Yeah.

539
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:11,922
Well, look who's here: you.

540
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,382
Where is she?

541
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:14,883
First of all, that's very dated
of you, Michael.

542
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:16,885
"He's" don't like
to be called "she's"

543
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,971
and I don't who this he-man is
that you're referring to.

544
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,264
No, no, no, it's a "she."
My girlfriend.

545
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,598
That's who I'm talking about.

546
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,142
Rebel. Rebel Alley.
Where is she?

547
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,977
- Never met him.
- It's a she.

548
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:26,603
Nice try.
Now what are you doing here?

549
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:27,896
You gonna meet her here
with her son, maybe,

550
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,023
so her son can play
in the ball pit?

551
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:30,649
That's disgusting, Michael.

552
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,734
- This is no place for a child.
- I know what you do.

553
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:34,278
Mom told me
you were bragging about

554
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,654
seeing somebody in showbiz.

555
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,489
Then I see
a frozen dove in a freezer.

556
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,241
That could be anything.

557
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,909
It said "Love each other"
on the foot band.

558
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,203
Yeah, that does
sound like one of mine.

559
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:43,453
Whose freezer was it in?

560
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,206
Rebel. Rebel Alley's.
Nice try, Gob.

561
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:46,707
If I want to see bad acting,

562
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:48,500
I'll go see Tobias in
<i>A Jew Comes to Dinner.</i>

563
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>But Gob wasn't acting.</i>

564
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,421
<i>He'd just forgotten</i>
<i>that he had met</i>

565
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,131
<i>a still-partying Rebel Alley.</i>

566
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,425
It's a little dove.
He's so cute.

567
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:59,094
<i>And Rebel returned home</i>
<i>to an unfortunate surprise.</i>

568
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,388
(dove squawks)

569
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:05,893
<i>She felt bad,</i>
<i>so quickly put it in a bag,</i>

570
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,229
<i>wrote down the species</i>
<i>and location</i>

571
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,773
<i>from which she'd acquired it</i>
<i>and then one further caution.</i>

572
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,027
<i>It was a merry mix-up.</i>

573
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,987
<i>But neither of them</i>
<i>knew any of this.</i>

574
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,031
Honestly, I have no idea what
you're talking about, Michael.

575
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:20,449
Yes, you do.
I got you dead to rights.

576
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,117
Dead to rights!

577
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,412
If ever we were gonna
have a fight, Michael,

578
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:26,414
this would be
the safest place to do it.

579
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,498
- Right! Let's do it! -This gay
bar would be the best...!

580
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,752
...something that can fillet a
chicken and subdue an intruder.

581
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:32,920
Let's do it!

582
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,300
Back to My Little Ballroom?

583
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:39,885
Yeah, this is the middle
of their workday.

584
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:41,845
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

585
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,597
You son of a bitch, Gob!

586
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:46,100
You'll never catch me, Michael!

587
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:49,270
♪ You raped and pushed
and struggled ♪

588
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:50,354
♪ All those balls in the air...♪

589
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:53,399
You have to find me, Michael!

590
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,817
♪ How hard can it be? ♪

591
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,527
Gob?

592
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,654
♪ ...those balls in the air ♪

593
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:04,910
♪ But keep those
balls in the air ♪

594
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:08,872
♪ Balls in the air. ♪

595
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,707
Are we done?

596
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm just surprisingly tired.

597
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,920
So tired... and so not hurt.

598
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:17,172
Look, I'm not the guy, Michael.

599
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:19,258
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I did what you said.

600
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,676
I filled all your...
your houses.

601
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:22,844
Hang on-- filled 'em?

602
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:24,805
Every last one of 'em.

603
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:25,889
With who?

604
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:28,642
With sex offenders.

605
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,019
Hey! Hey!

606
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,355
Gob, you're out of the movie!

607
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,149
BOY: Thanks for ruining
my birthday party.

608
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,654
NARRATOR:
<i>After fighting with Gob,</i>

609
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:42,823
<i>Michael paid a return visit</i>
<i>to his mother.</i>

610
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:44,241
- What happened to your eye?
- Oh...

611
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,909
Is that from Gob?
Was I right about him?

612
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,995
No, actually.
Want to hear a funny story?

613
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,580
You're out of the movie.

614
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:51,915
Hold on, George.

615
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,083
I beg your pardon?

616
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,751
Did you say George?
Is that Dad?

617
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,420
'Cause he's the one
who told me to hire Gob.

618
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,088
I actually owe him a call.

619
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,381
Hey, Dad, how you doing?

620
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:01,216
Y-Yes, he did.

621
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:02,468
With sex offenders.

622
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,136
You want
to hear something funny?

623
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:06,263
You're out of the movie!

624
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:07,931
Want to hold for Mom? Yeah.

625
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,392
Bye.

626
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:14,438
<i>And later that night,</i>
<i>Gob went to win back the trust</i>

627
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,566
<i>of the man he was still</i>
<i>hoping to con.</i>

628
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:19,151
Hey, look...

629
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:20,819
<i>Although he quickly</i>
<i>lost sight of that plan.</i>

630
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:23,572
- You're mad at me.
- You stood me up.

631
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,783
Oh, no-- Siri sent me
to the wrong "Ballroom,"

632
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,702
and then I got in this fight
with my brother

633
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:30,538
that didn't hurt,
it was just a whole...

634
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,080
Oh, is that it?
Or is it because

635
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:34,333
your boyfriend is 20
and I'm nearly twice that?

636
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,377
You think that I care
that you're...

637
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:38,045
three years older than me?

638
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:40,130
No! I don't--
Check my phone. Check my phone.

639
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:41,756
I don't need to check
your phone; come on in.

640
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:43,384
<i>But getting Gob's boyfriend's</i>

641
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,511
<i>contact information</i>
<i>out of that phone</i>

642
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,596
<i>was the reason</i>
<i>for Tony's charade.</i>

643
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:49,264
He hates me;
the whole family hates me.

644
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,517
- Damn it!
<i>- Which he remembered too late.</i>

645
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,934
Yeah, damn it!

646
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:54,853
I mean, I even helped
fill his stupid homes

647
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:57,398
with sex offenders,
and yet he still hates me.

648
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:59,400
Sex offenders need
a place to live, too.

649
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:03,153
Yes! Exactly!
That's what I always say.

650
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,655
It's, like, God...
you get me.

651
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,657
Well, you're an easy guy to get.

652
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,451
I can't go home;
he's probably waiting for me.

653
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,785
He's gonna be my boss?

654
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:12,079
He's the younger brother.

655
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,039
- How old is he?
- 42.

656
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,416
Same!

657
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:17,459
My younger brother's 42, also.

658
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,502
Same!

659
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:20,045
But...

660
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,422
- I mean 32.
- Third... two...

661
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:22,839
- 32.
- 32! Same!

662
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,383
- Same! I was gonna say it.
- Same?

663
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,510
- I was thinking the same.
- That's so weird!

664
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,387
(both talking at once)

665
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,598
- ...same.
- ...same.

666
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:31,723
- Crazy!
- ...zy!

667
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:32,807
Do you want a glass of wine?

668
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:33,892
I love wine.

669
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,394
- Red wine?
- I love red wine!

670
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:36,520
- Same!
- Same!

671
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:37,479
(laughing)

672
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:38,730
It's, like, two same.

673
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,357
- That's in-same.
- Totally in-same.

674
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:42,401
<i>It turns out the guys</i>
<i>had tons in common.</i>

675
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:43,944
- That's so weird.
- ...weird.

676
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:45,695

00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:47,615
BOTH:
...the last... time I went...

678
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:51,577
BOTH:
...scuba diving?

679
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:53,579
- Wow.
- Wow.

680
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:58,292
BOTH:
...eating... Captain Crunch.

681
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,252
- Same.
- Same.

682
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:01,836
<i>The hours melted away...</i>

683
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:03,380
TONY:
I guess I must have been...

684
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:04,548
<i>...and perhaps,</i>
<i>pretending to be gay...</i>

685
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,258
...I don't know, 17...

<i>...allowed them the freedom</i>
<i>to speak honestly.</i>

687
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,345
...when I started saying "same."

688
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:13,098
- Same. -That's about
the same time I got into magic.

689
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,100
You know, I think I got into
misdirection 'cause I just...

690
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:17,936
maybe I was trying to hide
my feelings or something.

691
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,981
I was just doing it
to get out of gym.

692
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:22,732
Who's Jim?

693
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:23,817
No, I... phys ed.

694
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:25,402
(laughs) Jealous!

695
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:27,779
- Oh... kidding.
- (laughing): Right.

696
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,239
(singsong):
Kidding.

697
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:30,365
(both laughing)

698
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,533
- Ooh!
- Oh...

699
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:33,327
- Don't stop.
- Oh!

700
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:35,162
Popcorn fight!

701
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:37,331
(Tony coughing)

702
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:39,749
(gagging)

703
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:47,424
It almost went down my throat.

704
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,551
(Gob sighs)

705
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:53,639
I'll get some water.

706
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:55,516
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just...

707
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,809
NARRATOR: <i>And Tony had</i>
<i>another opportunity</i>

708
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:01,522
<i>to get at Gob's phone.</i>

709
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:03,565
<i>And chose not to take it.</i>

710
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:07,736
<i>Gob also saw an opportunity to,</i>
<i>in some small way,</i>

711
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:10,656
<i>sabotage Tony's act.</i>

712
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,660
<i>And he also chose not to,</i>

713
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:17,245
<i>although he did put the mask</i>
<i>down his pants.</i>

714
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:19,414
Ah.

715
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:28,798
(gulping loudly)

716
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:39,142
BOTH:
Ah.

717
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,274
We were really thirsty.

718
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:47,651
Well, I guess I should get go...

719
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:50,362
Yeah, I'd say stay,
but I just... I feel...

720
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,947
I just feel like we should
take it slow, you know.

721
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:54,449
Oh, same.

722
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:57,411
I-I would definitely stay
and have gay sex with...

723
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,037
or normal sex with you, but...

724
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,499
Yeah, I would totally have
gay sex or whatever, but...

725
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,876
just drank a lot of water,
you know.

726
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:08,589
I-I just... I just had
a lot of water, too.

727
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,257
Yeah, I don't want
to rush things.

728
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:11,925
- Same.
- Same.

729
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:13,885
You know, maybe we make
a date to do it

730
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,721
another time,
and tonight we just...

731
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:17,431
We can just sit and talk.

732
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,516
<i>Gob had never said anything</i>
<i>like that before.</i>

733
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,518
That would be amazing.

734
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,689
<i>And then he said something else</i>
<i>he'd never said before.</i>

735
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:29,859
I have... feelings for you.

736
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:34,448
I have feelings...

737
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,784
for you.

738
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,493
<i>The feeling was friendship,</i>

739
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:40,579
<i>but neither had ever</i>
<i>experienced it.</i>

740
00:26:40,621 --> 00:26:43,665
<i>All they had to do now was</i>
<i>avoid making any specific...</i>

741
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:45,250
Why don't we have normal sex
on Cinco?

742
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:47,001
Let's have normal sex on Cinco.

743
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:49,546
<i>I guess they figured they could</i>
<i>get out of it later.</i>

744
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,256
<i>I'm not sure why</i>
<i>they said that.</i>

745
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:52,758
- Same!
- Same!

00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:57,387
NARRATOR: <i>It was</i>
<i>the Newport Beach celebration</i>

747
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,888
<i>of Cinco de Cuatro,</i>

748
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,349
<i>and after taking care</i>
<i>of some business,</i>

749
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,811
<i>- Gob ran into an almost</i>
<i>ex-wife.</i>-No, honey, on Cinco,

750
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:06,020
we break the stick
and not the piñata. Okay, look.

751
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,981
Whoo! Huh?

752
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:09,441
GOB:
Well...

753
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:11,067
- (chuckles)
- How long has it been?

754
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,111
- It's been five years.
- What are you doing here?

755
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:16,030
I'm taking my five-year-old
to see<i>Fantastic Four.</i>

756
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,616
I'm pretty sure
that's an adult...

757
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:19,033
Wait, you have a five-year-old?

758
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,160
<i>Oui.</i>

759
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:22,621
What? We what?

760
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:24,289
No, <i>oui.</i>
It's French for "yes."

761
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:25,874
As in, "Yes, I have a son,

762
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:28,376
and his father's a magician."

763
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:31,379
(intro to
"The Sound of Silence" playing)

764
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:36,426
(mariachi band playing
"The Sound of Silence")

765
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:38,345
Oh. It's not us.

766
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:39,971
Don't worry. It's not you.

767
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:41,682
It was a real magician.

768
00:27:41,723 --> 00:27:43,433
He took advantage
of how angry I was

769
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:45,185
when you wouldn't come out
of that cave.

770
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,020
He promised me
a life together, and after

771
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:49,564
he had his way with me,
he never wanted to see me again.

772
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:51,441
I don't think
there's anything wonderful

773
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:53,318
about Tony Wonder.

774
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,986
Are you kidding me?
Are you saying...

775
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:56,946
- Yes.
- Tony's straight?

776
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:01,034
<i>Gob felt betrayed by a person</i>
<i>he was starting to trust,</i>

777
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:02,952
<i>and he decided</i>
<i>to do something about it.</i>

778
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:06,748
How would you like to spend
the night making revenge love?

779
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,958
(sighs) Uh, Jacqueline,
could you, uh...?

780
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,671
<i>With a plan to get revenge</i>
<i>on Tony Wonder taking shape,</i>

781
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:14,798
<i>Gob met with Ann</i>
<i>at the model home.</i>

782
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,217
I'm ready, Gob.

783
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:18,802
Yeah, okay, well,
don't get ready yet.

784
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:21,388
Uh, Tony's not
going to be here for a bit.

785
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,848
Tony?

786
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,726
You're having sex
with Tony Wonder tonight.

787
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:28,311
Well, I-I thought
we were having sex.

788
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,313
Oh. Uh, no, thank you.
(chuckles)

789
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,982
Listen, here's the plan--
this house is wired

790
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:35,485
with hidden cameras
from<i>Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

791
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,780
There, there, there and there.

792
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,574
We're going to destroy
Tony's career

793
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:43,493
by proving that he's straight
when he has sex with you

794
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,537
while you're wearing...

795
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:47,455
this Gob mask.

796
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:49,207
Oh, and this little black
mini-robe.

797
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:52,502
Just to really sell
that you're a man.

798
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,212
Why would I wear a Gob mask?

799
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,464
Because Tony's coming here
expecting to have sex with me.

800
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:59,676
Look, in the act of having
fake gay sex,

801
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:01,678
you're going to take off
the mask to reveal

802
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,430
that you're having
real straight sex,

803
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:05,640
destroying his career,
and it's all going to be

804
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:07,768
captured on that camera
right there.

805
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,144
I don't want to have sex
with Tony.

806
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:12,814
Aren't you just a little cur...?

807
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,148
I have a child with him!

808
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,401
Okay, yes, new plan.

809
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:19,237
I'm going to wear
this Tony Wonder mask,

810
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,323
you're going to wear
the Gob mask, and...

811
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:24,701
I am going to have sex with you.

812
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,411
I'm sorry about all that.

813
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:29,289
And then, again, you're
going to rip off the Gob mask,

814
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,832
and the world will think
that he's straight,

815
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:32,041
and it'll ruin his career.

816
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,126
That's great.

817
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,461
Much simpler plan, thank you.

818
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,546
But the main event
is us having this...

819
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:40,675
pretend gay
but actually straight sex.

820
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:41,802
And you know what it is?

821
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,136
It's a straight bait.

822
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:44,805
I just realized,
it's a straight bait.

823
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:46,222
You ever watch those?

824
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,100
Good, and let me
have the room, yeah.

825
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:52,687
I need a little while
to get same.

826
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:55,941
To be the same.

Hello? Hello?

<i>...and was looking</i>

Hey... you.

833
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:10,956
It's Ann.

834
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:12,958
Awfully funny time
to run into you.

835
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,211
Yes, it is an awfully funny time
to see you, too...

836
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:19,130
you.

837
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:20,882
I know I owe you child support.

838
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,676
Don't worry, I got
something big in the works.

839
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,886
Actually,
that's why I came here.

840
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:26,805
- What are you doing here?
- Gob invited me.

841
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,098
He's planning
on getting revenge on you.

842
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,309
(laughs)
He would never do that.

843
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,688
Then why did he want to have sex
with me with this on?

844
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:36,940
Wait a minute.

845
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:38,984
Sex with you?

846
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:40,986
Gob is straight?

847
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,154
Oh, yeah, he is.

848
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,741
- Tony?
- I just... Why would he do that?

849
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:48,368
I thought he was gay.

850
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:50,704
- Tony, you're not gay, either.
- That's business.

851
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:52,873
Why do you think David Geffen
pretends to be gay?

852
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,457
You think
the Shubert Organization

853
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,125
would entrust a project
like<i>Dreamgirls</i>

854
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,627
to a straight producer?

855
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:59,420
How do you know so much
about<i>Dreamgirls?</i>

856
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:01,339
'Cause it's my business
to know about<i>Dreamgirls.</i>

857
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:03,174
And if you wanted to be
in a film version

858
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:06,302
of a musical called
<i>The Magic Show,</i> done in 1974

859
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:08,889
by another secretly straight guy
named Doug Henning,

860
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,640
you'd make it
your business, too.

861
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:12,017
I mean,
they can't give everything

862
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,267
to Doogie Howser, right?

863
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,353
Biggest fake gay there is,
by the way.

864
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:18,023
But if I fund it,
then they can't say no to me.

865
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:20,149
But it's big money--
I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil.

866
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:21,526
Fakeblock money.

867
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:23,152
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

868
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:25,154
I... I've been
overexplaining the (bleep)

869
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,364
out of everything lately.

870
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:27,824
You can't tell a soul.

871
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,367
No one I know will care.

872
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,912
Look, do you want
to out Gob as gay

873
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:34,039
so it'll ruin his career
as the Christian magician?

874
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:36,416
- Yes, of course.
- Are you still your own legs?

875
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:38,835
And do you have toenail polish
on you right now?

876
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:41,588
Are you asking, am I wearing
any, or do I have any extra?

877
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:43,423
Because the answer
to both questions is yes.

878
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:45,926
Then we're covered.
You and I will have sex.

879
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,469
And you wear this Gob mask, and
I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask.

880
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:49,930
Okay, I have two questions.

881
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:52,015
One: Are you going to
move this time?

882
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:55,769
And two: Why can't I just be me
and you wear the Gob mask?

883
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,355
I just thought that if you
had to have sex with a man,

884
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:01,274
wouldn't it be more of a turn-on

885
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:03,818
to have sex with someone
that looks like you?

886
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:06,738
Okay.

887
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,823
Put these on,
and then meet me in the bedroom

888
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:11,868
in five minutes for some serious
secular intercourse.

889
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,244
With myself.

890
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:16,039
Yeah.

891
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:27,717
- Same.
- Same.

892
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:30,971
- Same.
- Same.

893
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:33,431
<i>And two men who never loved</i>
<i>anyone but themselves...</i>

894
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,225
- Same. Same.
- Become... the same.

895
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:40,147
<i>...prepared to ruin</i>
<i>each other's reputation.</i>

896
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:42,565
- Same.
- Same.

897
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,819
- Same.
- Same.

898
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,737
GOB:
I should dim the lights.

899
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,949
<i>And that's how Ann</i>
<i>not only performed</i>

900
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:55,954
<i>a real-life version of Tony's</i>
<i>most beloved illusion...</i>

901
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:57,789
Now everybody's gay!

902
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:00,792
<i>...but was responsible</i>
<i>for the first reported instance</i>

903
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:04,004
<i>of a Christian</i>
<i>straight-to-gay conversion.</i>

904
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:11,636
<i>Gob went downstairs</i>
<i>to take a forget-me-now...</i>

905
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:13,554
Is that you, Maria?

906
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:16,557
<i>...when he bumped into a</i>
<i>brother who also had a secret.</i>

907
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,768
GOB: We did make quite a mess
in that bedroom.

908
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,603
- Michael.
- Gob?

909
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,647
<i>And relished the opportunity</i>
<i>to rub it in.</i>

910
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:25,358
Besides, you could not make me
feel worse right now.

911
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,943
I'd be willing
to let you have your

912
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:28,736
apology back if you give me
the chance to try.

913
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:31,656
Bad example. If you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

914
00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:34,075
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

915
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:35,493
something that you only
allowed to happen because

916
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,245
you thought he was gay
and you were hoping

917
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:40,040
to exact revenge, but then
you found out he was straight,

918
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:42,458
then you wanted to get even,
so maybe you put a mask

919
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,127
on someone and then tried
to convince yourself

920
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,295
that the sex you were
about to have was with yourself,

921
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:48,965
but it turned out to be him,
and all you ended up doing

922
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:51,092
was proving that your feelings
were real...

923
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,053
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

924
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,304
- It's not that.
- I said, "Bad example."

925
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:56,723
Hey, listen, Michael,
if you want,

926
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:58,058
- we can split this.
- No.

927
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,976
Believe me,
this is the last time I ever

928
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,269
- judge you for anything
- (door opens)

929
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,270
that you ever do.

930
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,189
Oh, (bleep).

931
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:06,691
Is that who you were with?

932
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:09,110
<i>And Gob decided to be generous</i>

933
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:11,571
<i>- with his last forget-me-now...</i>
- (grunting): No!

934
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:13,781
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>it was Michael</i>

935
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:16,868
<i>who forgot his shame,</i>
<i>and Gob who remembered.</i>

936
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,828
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

937
00:34:21,455 --> 00:34:24,584
<i>Michael wakes up and is</i>
<i>reminded of something horrible.</i>

938
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:27,461
FATHER MARSALA (over TV):
700,000. Think about it.

939
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:29,047
That is a very big number.

940
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,007
700,000 abortions every year...

941
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:32,759
NARRATOR:
<i>The amount of money he owed</i>

942
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,096
<i>because Tobias wanted</i>
<i>to mount this abortion.</i>

943
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:38,347
♪ Fantastic Three,
Fantastic... ♪

944
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,558
<i>And he does something that</i>
<i>he never thought he'd do...</i>

945
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,269
LUCILLE 2 (recorded):
Vote for Lucille!

946
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,729
- (beep)
- Hey, Lucille 2.

947
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:47,732
I was hoping that
we could get together

948
00:34:47,774 --> 00:34:50,777
and talk about how I can
repay you that loan.

949
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:53,487
<i>...and had already done.</i>

950
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:55,656
<i>And then, with nothing</i>
<i>left to lose,</i>

951
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:57,284
<i>he makes another call.</i>

952
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,368
Rebel. Yeah, Michael.

953
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,954
I need to come over.

954
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,705
I'm... I don't want to act

955
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:05,959
like it doesn't matter
to me anymore, 'cause it does.

956
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,376
Well, there's somebody here
right now.

957
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,753
I don't care.

958
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,297
The thing with
the other guy, it's...

959
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:12,090
you know, that's over,
so we don't...

960
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:14,425
we don't ever have to talk
about that ever again.

961
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:15,802
It's going away.

962
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:18,763
Okay, well, you can
come over later, okay?

963
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:21,224
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

964
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:25,270
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Who was that?

965
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,438
No one.

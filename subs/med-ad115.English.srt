00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:17,431
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:23,642
<i>Michael had begun to work weekends.</i>

6
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:27,111
<i>Unfortunately, this interfered</i>
<i>with the Saturday morning bike ride...</i>

7
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:29,273
<i>he usually took with his son.</i>

8
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,616
So this isn't bad, right?
just like a normal Saturday.

9
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,713
You don't have to drive so slow.
I can ride my bike by myself.

10
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,883
This actually doesn't
go any faster.

11
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:41,587
I mean, I know you have a lot of work, you know?

12
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:43,596
It still doesn't mean
I can't hang out with my...

13
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:45,598
Hang on one second.
This is Michael.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,464
Mom, I'm expecting
a very important phone...

15
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:50,833
<i>For God's sakes!</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

16
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:53,270
<i>Dad. Dad!</i>

17
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:56,741
Nice instincts, son.
Good reflexes.

18
00:00:56,844 --> 00:01:00,610
<i>Back at the model home, Lindsay</i>
<i>awoke late to find her husband missing.</i>

19
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:04,276
Maeby? Michael? Tobias?

20
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,285
- Work?
- <i>Tobias had recently...</i>

21
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:10,483
<i>been cast in a movie,</i>
<i>playing the role of a frightened inmate.</i>

22
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:13,890
I ain't going to squeal, man.

23
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:17,863
I ain't going to...
Oh, I'm not frightened! God!

24
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:20,799
Lindsay, say something
to scare me.

25
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:23,495
... me.

26
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:28,141
Nope. Nothing.
Thanks for trying though.

27
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:29,937
<i>You know what I ought to do?</i>

28
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:33,377
I ought to check myself
into a men's penal colony.

29
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,507
<i>Perhaps your father</i>
<i>could get me in.</i>

30
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:39,711
Well, if he can go to work,
so can I.

31
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,118
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was growing closer...</i>

32
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:45,283
<i>to her recently adopted Korean son,</i>
<i>whom she called Annyong.</i>

33
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:47,520
- Much better, Annyong.
- <i>Which isn't a name</i>...

34
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,619
- <i>Annyong.</i>
- <i>but the Korean word for "hello'.</i>

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,664
And I guess I can
comb my own hair.

36
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,893
Oh, please.
He's a little boy...

37
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,401
and since he's going to go off
and work for 10 hours...

38
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:58,529
<i>I want him to look nice.</i>

39
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:02,336
- Thank you, Lupe.
- You got a job, Annyong?

40
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:04,138
- <i>Annyong. Annyong.</i>
- Annyong.

41
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:08,773
At the banana stand.
Oh, his work ethic is unbelievable...

42
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:11,249
unlike some sons I know.

43
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,753
I'm a scholar.
I enjoy scholarly pursuits.

44
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:19,315
Suddenly playing with yourself
is a scholarly pursuit.

45
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,859
Hey, Lupe.

46
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:26,125
- What's wrong with Lupe?
- Oh, she's upset...

47
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,258
because I told her
she couldn't take the day off.

48
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:31,099
There's a family reunion
in Catalina.

49
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,332
Catalina? We're not going
to Catalina, are we?

50
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,932
<i>Buster had an unfortunate</i>
<i>encounter in a photo booth...</i>

51
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:38,511
<i>on the wildlife-populated island of Catalina.</i>

52
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:40,739
No, Lupe is.
You see, for her...

53
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:43,339
a family reunion might actually
be a pleasant experience.

54
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,885
They've got a bus,
and they want to use the parking lot...

55
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:47,886
to this building as a meeting place.

56
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:52,448
I mean, for God's sake,
it's not a hardware store.

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,553
We can't have them hanging around like
freeloaders, looking for an easy buck.

58
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:58,359
What's the emergency, Mom?

59
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,060
- I need money.
- I don't have time for this, okay?

60
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:03,068
I don't even get to see my own son.
I'm going to work now.

61
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,968
And while you're there,
find out from your assistant, Kitty...

62
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:07,973
why she didn't send my paycheck.

63
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:12,439
You get a paycheck
from the Bluth Company?

64
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:15,538
It's important to the company that
I keep up the image of my lifestyle.

65
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:19,278
Illusion, Mom.
And I'm the president of that company.

66
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:22,480
I believe I'm the one that asked you
to start shopping at Quantity Plus.

67
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,218
They made me apply
for a membership card.

68
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:31,390
- It was humiliating.
- I'll see what I can do for you.

69
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,558
Now that I know I'm the one
that pays Lupe...

70
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,397
I'm giving her
the day off, okay?

71
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,404
<i>Lupe, did you hear that?</i>
<i>Tell your bus driver...</i>

72
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,498
that he can pick up your family
at the Bluth Company parking lot.

73
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:46,239
- Oh, thank you, Michael.
- My hero.

74
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,872
Anyway, you enjoy
that paycheck when you get it.

75
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:50,974
It will be the last one
I ever send here.

76
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:55,647
Does that mean I have to go to your office
to get mine, too, or how's that work?

77
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,725
You gotta be kidding me.
All right. You know what, Buster?

78
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:02,159
Bob, in the copy room...
he quit today.

79
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:05,198
If you want your money,
you're gonna have to work for it.

80
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,132
Okay. I accept.
I'll take that job.

81
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,999
I will work in the copy room.

82
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:18,103
I wouldn't go in there
without knocking, Michael.

83
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,280
Now, I know we've been
putting in a lot of hours...

84
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,112
but we've got to keep our
heads down and power through...

85
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,186
you know, and... and sacrifice.

86
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:28,187
Don't mind me.

87
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,689
I'm just here to pick up
my paycheck and get out of here.

88
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,826
Guys, go ahead
and take a three.

89
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:39,730
Lindsay, how can you just come in here
and ask me for a paycheck?

90
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,530
Well, I usually ask Kitty,
uh, but she's not around...

91
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:45,127
and you're the only one here
I've ever seen before.

92
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:48,675
- How long has this been going on?
- Dad hired me out of college.

93
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:52,303
- You quit college.
- Yeah, well, I had a job. What was the point?

94
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,313
You have a job now.
Since Kitty's gone...

95
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,246
you can earn your check
by answering the phones.

96
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,183
Michael, it's Friday.
Everybody coasts on Friday.

97
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,777
- It's actually Saturday.
- Finally. I'm out of here.

98
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,019
- I'll see you Tuesday.
- I'm serious, Lindsay.

99
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:09,152
- This is why your employees hate you.
- They're actually fond of me.

100
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,891
Okay, guys, back to the staff meeting.

101
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:20,997
- Uh, Lindsay. Hello. The phones.
- Well, you said "staff."

102
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,010
The zoning committee
feels that we're...

103
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:28,081
trying to squeeze too many units
onto a lot this size...

104
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:30,241
and we need to if we want
to make a profit.

105
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,251
<i>So how do we fit</i>
<i>these units on there?</i>

106
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:35,914
Are these fluorescent lights
bothering anybody else besides me?

107
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:38,548
That's not what I want to deal with today.

108
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,559
You and I have different
management styles.

109
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:43,221
I believe work should be fun,
and you try to crush people's spirits.

110
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,299
<i>What's next, Michael?</i>
<i>Are you going to make dancing illegal?</i>

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,265
Is this the tiny town from <i>Footloose?</i>

112
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:50,633
Good point.

113
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:53,639
Can you go to your desk, please?
Be like Buster.

114
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:56,209
He's been in the copy room.
I haven't seen him all day.

115
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,210
<i>In fact, Buster had grown anxious...</i>

116
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,974
- <i>in the confined space of the copy room.</i>
- Bob?

117
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,480
Bob?

118
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,244
- Bob?
- Bob?

119
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,649
Bob?

120
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:10,248
I need a different job.

121
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:13,053
I'm having real trouble
in a confined indoor space.

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,096
- Oh. Hey, coworker.
- How do you feel about working outdoors?

123
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,265
Uh, what else do you have?

124
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,672
<i>At the banana stand,</i>
<i>George Michael was also working.</i>

125
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,606
I thought your dad
worked last weekend.

126
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,940
No, last week he had to finish
planning the new subdivision.

127
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:34,173
Oh. So did he finish it?

128
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:39,383
No. Hey, are you trying
to make me feel bad?

129
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:42,080
- Yeah, I guess. Sorry.
- Yeah.

130
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,521
- I'm just bored.
- That's okay.

131
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,820
I guess he just likes work
more than he likes you.

132
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:52,455
<i>Tobias went to the prison</i>
<i>in preparation for his own work.</i>

133
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:56,229
I have a letter of introduction
here from Carl Weathers.

134
00:06:56,337 --> 00:07:00,171
<i>Fortunately, the new warden</i>
<i>was an appreciator of the arts.</i>

135
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:03,573
It would be an honor to have you
research in this institution.

136
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:05,042
Oh.

137
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:07,079
And, if I may...

138
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:11,618
I have this script
I'd love to get to Carl.

139
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,882
- Okay.
- The warden could easily be black.

140
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:16,616
- Oh! Yes.
- Okay.

141
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,725
Lets see, now.

142
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:25,955
187 won't be free
till Tuesday... at midnight.

143
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:30,366
And I can't put you into 212,
because there's already another actor...

144
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:34,100
researching a role in there...
Steve Buscemi.

145
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,641
Oh! Re...

146
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:39,509
Well, l... I would like to bunk
with my father-in-law.

147
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:43,743
Okay.

148
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,978
Let's get you into wardrobe.

149
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,417
Wow! Prison!

150
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:53,516
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and Buster</i>
<i>had arrived at the construction site...</i>

151
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,357

That's great, buddy.

00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,735
Listen, I know that we're
behind on the payroll...

155
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,635
but as soon the zoning committee
gives me their approval...

156
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,640
I know the bank's gonna release the money.

157
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:11,506
Right now, I'm just asking everyone
to power through, sacrifice.

158
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:15,139
I'll try, but these guys have been
working too hard not to get paid.

159
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:18,184
I'll get on it. But until then,
I got Buster here to help.

160
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,777
That's another guy.

161
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,791

Michael.

164
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,559
- How did you know I was here?
- I called the office.

165
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,400
You know, that Kitty is starting
to sound pretty damn sexy to me.

166
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:41,565
- Maybe I oughta...
- That was Lindsay.

167
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,707
- Anyway...
- Yeah.

168
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:47,474
- What's Busty doing here?
- Michael got me the job.

169
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,572
How did you get him
to do construction work?

170
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:51,981
The guy's like the world's
biggest chicken.

171
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,884
- I'm not a chicken.
- Yeah, he's not a chicken.

172
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:56,888
He just doesn't like
confined spaces, that's all.

173
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,983
- I thought it was open spaces.
- No, it's both. But I love it here.

174
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:04,223
<i>And the language</i>
<i>these guys use.</i>.. <i>rough!</i>

175
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:08,700
<i>One of the guys told me to take my head</i>
<i>out of my bottom and get back to work.</i>

176
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:11,202
My bottom!

177
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,008
What do you want?
You want your paycheck?

178
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,169
I usually get cash
under the table.

179
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,873
- But if you made it out to cash...
- I got bad news for you, Gob.

180
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:27,511
<i>Hey, pick up the pace, douche bag!</i>

181
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:30,522
- Michael!
- <i>You too, candy ass!</i>

182
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,592
"Candy ass."

183
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,186
<i>With Michael gone,</i>
<i>Lindsay was taking over.</i>

184
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:38,696
Thanks, fellas.

185
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,599
We, uh, finished the proposal,
and we're gonna order some pizza.

186
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:46,867
Um, we were wondering if we could have
two toppings on account it's Saturday.

187
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,442
Well, he's not here,
and since I'm in charge...

188
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,943
I'm taking you all out to lunch...
the whole staff.

189
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:55,446
- We have to go to lunch!
- <i>We have to go to lunch, you guys.</i>

190
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,210
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Lets go to lunch.</i>

191
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:02,044
- What happened to the lights?
- Isn't this better?

192
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:05,091
Doesn't this just wanna
make you curl up and forget about the world?

193
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:07,387
Lindsay, we need the light
so that people...

194
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:11,055
- Where are these people going?
- I'm taking them out to lunch.

195
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,996
Did you reserve a restaurant?

196
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,591
- Are they taking their own cars?
- They'll figure something out.

197
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,170
No, they won't.
You don't have a plan?

198
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,967
I told you, these people are sheep.

199
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,803
<i>All right? They'll wander off,</i>
<i>and you'll lose the sheep.</i>

200
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,902
- You've lost the sheep.
- Oh, they'll be fine.

201
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:27,913
<i>In the parking lot,</i>
<i>the employees boarded the bus...</i>

202
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,314
<i>Lupe had rented</i>
<i>for her family reunion...</i>

203
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:34,182
<i>thinking Lindsay had reserved it</i>
<i>to take them to lunch.</i>

204
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:38,156
Well, I need this proposal. I don't know
how they can walk off and just...

205
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:40,419
It's right here, Michael.
You weren't here...

206
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:43,428
and everything got done
while I was in charge.

207
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,522
- See? Not so hard, what you do.
- You just got lucky this once.

208
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,533
You really think I could leave here
and everything would be fine?

209
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,500
I think everything
would be fine but you.

210
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:52,629
I don't think
you can leave.

211
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,934
If I didn't have that phone call
from the zoning committee...

212
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:58,307
You'd have no reason to live.
I'll have it forwarded to your cell.

213
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,208
Great. I'll leave.
Not a problem.

214
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:05,683
I, uh, can spend some time with my son.
So, you're in charge.

215
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,778
- Try not to bring the whole company down.
- Like that's even possible.

216
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,722
<i>So the employees</i>
<i>headed off to Catalina...</i>

217
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,521
<i>providing the surveillance team</i>
<i>that had installed the lighting...</i>

218
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,619
<i>with the opportunity</i>
<i>they needed.</i>

219
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,463
- The place is empty.
- All right. Let's get in there
and bring this company down.

220
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:28,573
<i>At prison, George Sr.</i>
<i>was making converts to his new way oflife.</i>

221
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:32,236
You won't regret this,
LittleJustice.

222
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:37,079
Uh, okay, what say from now on
we call you David Ben-Avram?

223
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,243
What are you doing
to my guy here?

224
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:42,254
<i>Nothing. I'm just merely</i>
<i>providing him with options.</i>

225
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:46,759
This yarmulke will protect you,
David Ben-Avram.

226
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,920
<i>Pipe!</i>

227
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,488
<i>I've got worse planned for you</i>
<i>if you keep trying to convert my team.</i>

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,592
Hold it. Hold it, now. Wait.
Now, I'm doing no such thing.

229
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:59,433
Both of our religions
have a lot to offer.

230
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:03,498
There's theJewish notion of heaven and that...
that it can be attained here on Earth...

231
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,307
and there is your belief in
the cleansing power of the pipe.

232
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:10,212
No more teaching from you.

233
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,114
No teaching. No teaching.

234
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,119
<i>It was at</i>
<i>that moment that George Sr...</i>

235
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:16,121
- <i>reunited with his son-in-law.</i>
- Father.

236
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,123
Tobias, what the hell
are you doing here?

237
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:21,683
I'm here to study with you,
to learn from you.

238
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:25,287
- Teach me.
- There's no teaching.

239
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,129
- There's no teaching.
- <i>Who is this little</i>...

240
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:30,999
It's been quite awhile
since anybody called me a tyke...

241
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:33,538
but, no, I am Dr. Tobias Fünke.

242
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,132
Or, with your help,
Frightened Inmate #2.

243
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:39,337
And who is this
shiny building of a man?

244
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:42,040
- Oh, I'm very scared right now.
- Oh, we're starting.

245
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,243
Oh, yes. Let me get
something to write with.

246
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:48,082
<i>Back at the banana stand,</i>
<i>Annyong had arrived.</i>

247
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:51,589
It looks like we're gonna have
to restock on nuts tonight, all right?

248
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:55,059
Now, listen, I know that that's
nobody's favorite Saturday night...

249
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:57,722
but if we just power through and keep
our heads down, we might be able to...

250
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:02,359
- Annyong and I are fine here.
I mean, you don't have to...
- <i>Annyong.</i>

251
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:05,370
You don't have to worry so much.

252
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,667
I mean, obviously, your dad
doesn't want to spend time with you...

253
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:10,106
but, you know,
go to the beach or whatever.

254
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,111
- He's just not around, okay?
- He no have father?

255
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:15,340
Older lady adopt him too?

256
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:18,009
<i>No, he have father.</i>
<i>Father no love him.</i>

257
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:21,110
No, he love me... loves me.
He loves me.

258
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,884
<i>So, all right.</i>
<i>Maybe I will take a little time off...</i>

259
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,186
and go to the beach or something.

260
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:31,060
<i>I went to beach once. Next thing</i>
<i>I know, I'm in crate next to pig.</i>

261
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,094
<i>Instead, George Michael</i>
<i>had decided to leave...</i>

262
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:40,605
<i>for his father's office</i>
<i>and have lunch with him.</i>

263
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:43,403
<i>Meanwhile, the white collar</i>
<i>Bluth Company employees...</i>

264
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,978
<i>had made it through</i>
<i>the first leg of theirjourney...</i>

265
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,879
<i>and were about to embark on the second</i>.

266
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,543
<i>And Lucille,</i>
<i>taking Michael's advice...</i>

267
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:54,882
<i>returned home from Quantity Plus</i>
<i>with a problem.</i>

268
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:59,254
Lupe! Buster?

269
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:02,861
Annyong? Hello?

270
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:06,160
<i>With Lupe gone and the rest</i>
<i>ofher family working for once...</i>

271
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:08,757
<i>Lucille realized</i>
<i>she missed them.</i>

272
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,100
Well, now, who the hell
is gonna unload the car?

273
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,003
<i>Hola.</i> Is Rosa still alive?

274
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,599
No? Hmm.

275
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:20,839
Okay. This is not my day.

276
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,980
<i>Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>stopped by to say hello to his son...</i>

277
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,350
<i>and found out he had</i>
<i>gone to the beach.</i>

278
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:30,980
<i>So Michael went</i>
<i>to find George Michael...</i>

279
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:33,855
<i>and also try to figure out</i>
<i>a solution for his space problem.</i>

280
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,930
<i>And then he decided that perhaps he,</i>
<i>too, should try a little relaxation.</i>

281
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:49,669
<i>Back at the construction site,</i>
<i>Gob was also ready to take the afternoon off.</i>

282
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,643
Screw this!
I have my pride.

283
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,271
I don't care how much
they're paying me.

284
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:58,783
You got paid? I thought
we were all making sacrifices.

285
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:01,820
Yeah, well, maybe it's time for some of
those big shots at the Bluth Company...

286
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:03,822
to start making some sacrifices.

287
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,859
<i>I say we shut down construction!</i>

288
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:14,290
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
Why are we stopping?

289
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,666
This is fun!
We should do this just for the fun.

290
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:20,239
Easy for him to say.
He got his paycheck too.

291
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,240
- Unbelievable.
- That's not right.

292
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:25,402
Come on, you douche bags.
We're all on the same team!

293
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:28,037
Don't listen to him.
He'll never stand up to the man.

294
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:31,481
He's a chicken. A chicken.

295
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,151
My whole life you've called me
a chicken, but that's over now.

296
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,350
I have nothing to prove.

297
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,259
That is not how a chicken sounds.
Chickens don't clap!

298
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,334
- Chickens don't clap!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:50,665
That is not how we settle things on a site.

300
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,238
We got our own way of
finding out who's a chicken...

301
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,241
by a little game
we like to call... "chicken."

302
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,636
I hope you're
up to this, Buster.

303
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:02,579
This is a game of courage,
a game for men.

304
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:05,116
Yeah, well, it's a game
I'm ready for!

305
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:09,720
- Uh-oh. My seat doesn't have a cushion.
- Ready? Go!

306
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,693
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna need a cushion.

307
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,360
<i>As the Bluths squared off, Lindsay dealt</i>
<i>with the news of the work stoppage.</i>

308
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,098
This wasn't my fault.

309
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:28,606
- I thought you were Michael.
- So wait. My Dad's not here?

310
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,041
Nope. He went out for lunch to have fun.
But everything's fine.

311
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:35,308
I mean, if he asks, everything's fine.
My style works.

312
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,781
<i>This place is humming along.</i>

313
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,553
So wait. My Dad said that
he was waiting for a call.

314
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:44,055
- That he had to stay here.
- Oh, no, he can get that call anywhere.

315
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:46,648
- I just have to forward it to him.
- Huh.

316
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,593
Hey, would you mind running
things for a little while?

317
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,391
- I'm... I'm not really...
- It's not hard.

318
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:53,398
<i>So Lindsay headed off to deal...</i>

319
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,627
<i>with the work stoppage</i>
<i>problem at the site.</i>

320
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,599
<i>Lindsay knew Michael would be furious...</i>

321
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,767
<i>ifhe found out</i>
<i>the building had stopped...</i>

322
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,845
<i>so she had to find a way to start it...</i>

323
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,244
<i>and that's when</i>
<i>she saw Lupe's family.</i>

324
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:10,077
Hey, who's ready
to have some fun?

325
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:12,743
Uh...

326
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,013
<i>Meanwhile, Michael continued</i>
<i>his relaxation at the beach.</i>

327
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,952
Okay, these units
aren't too close together.

328
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:20,686
We can get away with this,
right, people?

329
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:24,389
<i>All right. Just speed it up. Come on.</i>
<i>Keep your heads down. Power through.</i>

330
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,262
Oh, no. Where is...
Where's my phone?

331
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,337
I used it
to dig the "B" unit.

332
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:34,168
- You what?
- I'll get it.

333
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:37,471
No, no. You're gonna ruin it!
What am I doing?

334
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,946
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

335
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,608
- Hey, George Michael, where are you?
- I'm at the office.

336
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,743
Lindsay put me in charge here
'cause there was nobody here...

337
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:48,753
and she had to go to
the construction site...

338
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,755
'cause the workers stopped working.

339
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:54,190
Great. Now we're never gonna finish phase
three, and everything's gonna fall apart.

340
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:58,321
This whole thing is gonna cave in, and
we're gonna be left with a bunch of...

341
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:05,628
Great. Now my sand castle
has a giant pool in it.

342
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,640
<i>That's when Michael saw</i>
<i>the solution to his space problem.</i>

343
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:11,609
I gotta go, buddy.

344
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:13,702
He's making a sand castle?

345
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:19,547
<i>George Michael noticed something too.</i>

346
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:28,393
<i>He knew his father</i>
<i>had always loved him...</i>

347
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:33,125
<i>but at this moment, he was actually</i>
<i>holding the proof in his hands.</i>

348
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,497
<i>Unfortunately, it was at this moment...</i>

349
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:38,162
<i>that the investigators went into action.</i>

350
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:40,000
- There's the kid.
- Our cover's blown. Get out.

351
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:41,733
- <i>I've got a clean shot over here.</i>
- No!

352
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:45,368
Get the proof.
He's got the evidence file.

353
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,003
Come on. Come on.
I told you to find a stud. Go!

354
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,186
<i>Back at the construction site, Buster...</i>

355
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:05,560
<i>and Gob's showdown was</i>
<i>reaching a dramatic conclusion.</i>

356
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:15,206
Wow. Who won?

357
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:19,574
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>Gob saw his brother as a man.</i>

358
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,943
Let's get back to work, guys.

359
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:26,709
<i>And Lindsay arrived...</i>

360
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,220
<i>suddenly trying</i>
<i>a new management style.</i>

361
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:32,086
- <i>What's this now?</i>
- Okay.

362
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,217
So you guys
don't wanna work? Fine.

363
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,524
I've got a stair car full of Mexican
laborers that would love a day's work.

364
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,530
"Laborers"? I'm a professor
of American Studies...

365
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,793
at the University
of Mexico City.

366
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,562
I took a dance class there.

367
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,074
I thought you were taking us to Catalina.
What happened to Catalina?

368
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,514
- You'd bring in scabs, just like that?
- Watch me. Go to work!

369
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:59,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're shutting it down.

370
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:01,917
- Michael, I've solved this.
- No, it's not you.

371
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:03,921
It's me. It's wrong.
The plan is wrong.

372
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:06,355
We gotta get rid of
the individual swimming pools...

373
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,587
and put in a great big
communal one right in the center.

374
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:12,688
Lindsay, you were right. We've all
been working a little bit too hard.

375
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,666
You can't manage by threatening
and pushing people...

376
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:17,669
and sometimes you have to
reward hard work.

377
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:20,467
Maybe reward it with a party.

378
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,507
Right. I didn't mean tonight.
just some time in the future...

379
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,770
when we have some
extra food and liquor.

380
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:26,937
Lupe!

381
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:30,413
Lupe, I need help
with the groceries!

382
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:33,351
How about just liquor?

383
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:35,819
<i>And the two Bluth men finally did relax.</i>

384
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:39,289
Thanks for coming out. I've been dying
to get some time with you. I really have.

385
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:41,360
That's okay. I know how much
you care about me.

386
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,895
Unfortunately, so does
the federal government.

387
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:45,965
- Want more punch?
- Sure.

388
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,068
Wait. The feds?

389
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,694
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

390
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,796
<i>Tobias gets an insight</i>
<i>into fear.</i>

391
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:56,068
Well, let's discuss
this bunking situation.

392
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:57,973
You'll be sleeping
under me for a while.

393
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:00,568
I sold you for a pack
of cigarettes.

394
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,413
<i>And the employees</i>
<i>find a new direction.</i>

395
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:07,315
Whoa! Whoa! What are you folks
doin' on this part of the mountain?

396
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,854
- We're lost.
- Well, I can give you a ride back into town.

397
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:13,756
Come on. Let's go. Buck, Banjo,
get on up here. Come on, boy.

398
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,658
There you go.

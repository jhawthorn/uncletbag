1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,019
<i>Michael was heading to work when he saw
something he had never seen before lunch...</i>

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,023
<i>his twin sister Lindsay.</i>

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,117
- You're up?
- Yeah. I work for our attorney now.

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,527
Bob Loblaw. Of course.
What is he thinking?

9
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,690
- I mean, how's it going?
- Lousy.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,065
You know, I only took this nanny job
so he'd give me a free divorce...

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,468
and then marry me so
I'd never have to work again.

12
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,904
But all he seems to care about
is that daughter of his.

13
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,101
I got my horse to canter today.
First time.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,474
I've always wanted
to make love on a horse.

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,479
And tomorrow, we're gonna
work without a lunge line.

16
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,812
That's so funny, because
I can put my leg behind my head.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,216
I mean, come on.
I'm the nanny.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,311
Of course. Who wouldn't wanna
snog the nanny?

19
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,482
"Snog." Is that another
one of your new "Britishisms"?

20
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,857
<i>It was. Michael had recently
fallen bum over noggin...</i>

21
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,226
<i>for a beautiful English woman
called Rita.</i>

22
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,231
Did I say snog again? Bloody hell.

23
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:11,429
You wanna win over Bob, you gotta
win over the kid. Here's what you do.

24
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,098
You find something that you're
good at and you share it with her.

25
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,335
While you're at it, share it with us too,
huh? And try not to act so desperate.

26
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,344
Oh, my God.
Did I miss a call?

27
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,437
This is Rita.
Just wanted to say hi.

28
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,073
I'm on my way to the train station.
Bye-bye.

29
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,175
She's leaving.
I gotta get over there.

30
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,655
<i>- Michael raced to the station...</i>
- God, is that how I look?

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,952
<i>Where Rita was being given her ticket.</i>

32
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,257
Here's your ticket and your instructions.
Call me if you get in over your head.

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,824
Hey, hi there, Rita.
Hey! Michael.

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,132
Hi. Where are you going,
and how long you going for?

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,430
You're right. You-You...
Do not answer that.

36
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,032
- You know, I'm not getting clingy.
- Why are you breathing like that?

37
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,044
I wasn't hurrying to come stop you.

38
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,944
I was out on... for my daily, uh...
Do you run at all?

39
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,813
Oh, yes.
I was in the Olympics once.

40
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:04,049
- I won a silver medal.
- You're <i>that</i> Rita Leeds? Oh, my goodness!

41
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,785
And a silver medal, yes.
And you came in second.

42
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,760
Now I'm very embarrassed
to be out of breath in front of you.

43
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,299
But you take my breath away.

44
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,493
Oh, Michael.

45
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,230
You're such a!@%$#.

46
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,273
<i>Michael was stunned.</i>

47
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,833
<i>He assumed Rita was using the word
!@%$# in the American sense...</i>

48
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>meaning "weak" or "cowardly."</i>

49
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,648
<i>In fact, Rita meant it
in the British sense...</i>

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,548
<i>meaning "sweet” or "gentle,"
as in "pussycat."</i>

51
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,781
The Jerries aren't so bad.
They're just being led by a rotten apple.

52
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,827
Oh, Reggie. Fighting for your country,
you're such a pussy.

53
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:46,558
When I miss your lips, I'll put a
@%$ in my mouth and think of you.

54
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,157
<i>That also had</i>
<i>a different meaning over there.</i>

55
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,998
<i>Michael returned home...</i>

56
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,904
<i>hoping to take solace
in his son's company.</i>

57
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,341
I was thinking you and I should
maybe go play a little catch.

58
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,674
Maybe go for a run.
Do some guy stuff.

59
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,716
- But we're not good at that stuff.
- Yes, I am. We... both are.

60
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,047
<i>Michael and his son had never been...</i>

61
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,678
<i>a very successful athletic team.</i>

62
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,349
<i>In fact, the only thing
George Michael really liked...</i>

63
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,256
<i>was hanging motionless
from the monkey bars...</i>

64
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,852
<i>which the president's counsel
on fitness ranks as...</i>

65
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,228
<i>"slightly easier than the slide."</i>

66
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,962
Anyway, I was just thinking that
maybe we should emphasize athletics...

67
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,470
a little bit more in this family.

68
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm gonna start us off
with a protein drink, okay?

69
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,709
Still doing that, huh?

70
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,269
Well, l-I do think we should go
for a run, huh? Some real guy stuff.

71
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,474
I'm supposed to go fabric shopping
with Ann today.

72
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,712
I think we can go butcher.

73
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,788
Uh, uh, no.
We're-We're making a gown.

74
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,824
- She's gonna be in a beauty pageant.
- Yeah. Who's Ann?

75
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:50,885
My-My girlfriend. She's... You've met her
so many times. You've met her and met her.

76
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,898
I know who Annabelle is. Who's
the Ann that's in the beauty pageant?

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,661
That's her. Her name isn't Annabelle.
That's Ann.

78
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,032
No, I know that her name
is not Annabelle. I just...

79
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,231
That's how I remember her name,
'cause her body's kind of shaped like a...

80
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,004
She's the belle of the ball.
What is she doin' in the beauty pageant?

81
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,409
She's... Is she running
the lights or something?

82
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,913
She's in it.
She's a-a contestant.

83
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,076
- Sort of like an inner beauty pageant.
- Ah! There it is.

84
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,121
- Is it like a Christian thing?
- Well, it's half.

85
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,453
It's at the state fair, which this year's
gonna be a church and state fair.

86
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,153
<i>It seems the state had run out of money...</i>

87
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,628
<i>and was going to cancel the fair...</i>

88
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,564
<i>until it was resurrected by this man...</i>

89
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,760
<i>who agreed to cover the fair's costs...</i>

90
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,837
<i>if it included a church presence.</i>

91
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,339
I got some news for you. There's
no such thing as an inner beauty pageant.

92
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,137
They’re just gonna pick the chick
with the best T and A.

93
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,212
<i>As a child, Maeby had been entered...</i>

94
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,406
<i>into a number of progressive pageants...</i>

95
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,815
<i>that claimed to celebrate
beauty in all its forms.</i>

96
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,945
<i>But the winners still tended to have it
going on in the conventional sense.</i>

97
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,456
Remember how badly
you used to want to win?

98
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,026
- No, I remember how badly <i>you</i> used
to want me to win. - We should have...

99
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,531
- I don't know where that hair of yours came from.
- Shameless Plugs on Placentia.

100
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,500
Looks pretty good, huh? And they're
not licensed, which means big savings.

101
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,869
That's been happening a lot lately.

102
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,137
- You know what? This is the perfect thing to do.
- No, Mom, I'm not gonna do it.

103
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,145
No, no, not you.
Bob's daughter Hope.

104
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,045
If I can get Hope this crown...

105
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,642
maybe her father might just wanna
crown me, if you know what I mean.

106
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,745
I'm guessing have sex,
but that's meeting you more than halfway.

107
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:28,850
Tobias, wanna clean up that mirror?
And the vase?

108
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,260
Perhaps if I could coach a certain
young lady to victory in this pageant...

109
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,232
I can gain back
the respect of my wife.

110
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,895
- I'll show them a little T and A.
- You can't make me do it, Dad.

111
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,337
- Tobias and Ann.
- My Ann?

112
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,001
No, I don't... I don't think
we need any help.

113
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,010
Oh, George Michael, she's a girl.

114
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,945
I need to teach her how to be a woman.
Within her lies a queen.

115
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,347
Let me out that queen.

116
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,044
I think you just did.

117
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,620
- Michael.
- Gob.

118
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,748
Let me get that for you.
Um...

119
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:03,454
So a young neighborhood tough by the name
of Steve Holt's gonna be here any minute.

120
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,690
- Your son.
- According to him.

121
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,894
- And a DNA test.
- I heard the jury's still out on science.

122
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,027
Anyway, he wants to go to the fair.

123
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,370
But I don't wanna hurt his feelings,
so I need you to do it.

124
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,240
Just tell him that I'm
out of town on one of my trips.

125
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,076
- I'm not gonna lie to your son.
- Come on. I lie to yours all the time.

126
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,082
Michael, I'm not ready to be a dad.

127
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,085
Plus, I'm gonna be very busy this week
being a judge for the pageant.

128
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,452
<i>Gob had been a pageant judge for years.</i>

129
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,651
- You can't believe what it does for your sex life.
- I don't wanna hear it.

130
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,594
I don't wanna say it. First place chick
is hot but has an attitude.

131
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,326
Doesn't date magicians.
Second place is someone weird usually...

132
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,164
like a Chinese girl or a geologist.

133
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,536
But third place, although a little bit plain,
has super low self-esteem.

134
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:53,408
So I step in and, uh,
lay her crown upon my sweet head.

135
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,607
Have I missed this euphemism?

136
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,684
<i>- Steve Holt!</i>
- I should go.

137
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,987
He's hiding from me, isn't he?

138
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,650
You know, you gotta stop
saying your name all the time.

139
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,422
It's just they have this father-son triathlon,
and I just wanted him to do it with me.

140
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,327
- Mmm.
- Stupid, huh?

141
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,596
- That's a pretty tough race.
- Only for a wimp, a wuss.

142
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,103
- A!@%$#.
<i>- And Steve didn't mean pussycat.</i>

143
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,609
Uh, Steve, how'd you like
to do that triathlon with me?

144
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,109
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,772
- Uncle Mike!
- Steve Holt!

146
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,543
<i>Both men felt good about themselves.</i>

147
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,551
- Uncle Mike!
- Steve Holt!

148
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,180
<i>But Gob didn't share their enthusiasm.</i>

149
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,817
So this is how Michael
gets rid of my son... by stealing him.

150
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,293
Well, I'll just have
to steal something of his...

151
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:49,062
like, say, his bicycle,
as a... placeholder.

152
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,803
<i>Michael was trying to prove
his manliness with Steve Holt.</i>

153
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,539
Rita. Hey, it's Michael.
Just wanted to let you know...

154
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,812
that I'm running a triathlon at the fair,
and if you're back in town...

155
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,819
Oh, I can't believe I chose
this moment to call you.

156
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,913
<i>Meanwhile, at the Church and State Fair...</i>

157
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,255
<i>Maeby was trying to enroll
in the pageant... sort of.</i>

158
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,661
Your situation poses a problem.
Let me talk to our chairman.

159
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,595
- Hey, what are you doing, Maeby?
- It's Surely.

160
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:27,230
I'm just here to prove that
all these pageants care about is looks.

161
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,332
Just watch. Surely's inner beauty
will get trumped by her outer icky.

162
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,843
- What happened to your nose?
- It's part of the disguise.

163
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,278
Isn't it cool? The same one
Nicole Kidman wore in <i>The Hours.</i>

164
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,079
<i>It had been purchased for her at a charity auction
she'd attended as a studio executive...</i>

165
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,177
- $10,000.
<i>- by Jamie Kennedy.</i>

166
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,188
You're such a dear.

167
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,622
But I'm not putting you in my remake
of <i>A Thoroughly Polite Dustup.</i>

168
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,352
Miss Wolfbeak...

169
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,695
although it costs quite a bit
to put in a ramp for you, we got approval.

170
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,563
You're in.

171
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,864
<i>As Maeby found herself
stuck in a beauty pageant...</i>

172
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,532
<i>Lucille was meeting
with attorney Bob Loblaw...</i>

173
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,076
<i>about getting her son
out of the army.</i>

174
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,873
I mean, my God. He's already lost a hand.
If he loses a leg...

175
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,971
how will we ever
get him out of the apartment?

176
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,108
Well, the army does have
a “one in, one out" program...

177
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,121
where the inductee is relieved of duty
once he enlists someone to take his place.

178
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,386
So I'm supposed to find some poor,
innocent soul and hook him?

179
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,394
Well, that's not going to help
sign anyone. Where's your hand?

180
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,464
It got stuck in the prize hole again.

181
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,898
I told you not to play
that stupid game anymore.

182
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:34,166
- Ow. There goes number three.
<i>- I wasn't playing it.</i>

183
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,207
I was just trying
to get my other one back.

184
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,971
Hi. Sorry, sorry.
I totally forgot about this... meeting.

185
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,978
What's going on?

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,742
Your father's gotten a lot of bad press
because of the escape attempts.

187
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,250
- Volunteer for something.
- I'll do anything to get out of this!@%$#% apartment.

188
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,686
You'll do anything to get out of
!@%$#% in this apartment.

189
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,951
- Ah, you're drunk.
- Yeah, Mom, can you just...

190
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,256
And, Dad... You know,
why do we even need the surrogate?

191
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,092
- Dad's in the apartment...
- Don't come in here. Don't come in here.

192
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,462
Don't come in here.
I said not to come in.

193
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,169
- Would you get out here please?
- I'm watching the game.
<i>- I said not to come in!</i>

194
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,105
- I did not spend money on
a surrogate so you can just...
- I lost him.

195
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,506
I think you've got your hands full
trying to make this guy look good.

196
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,205
There's a "Startled Straight"
program at the fair...

197
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,975
which involves you speaking
with at-risk male youth...

198
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,244
to scare them away
from criminal behavior.

199
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,118
Okay. I can do that. I'm gonna need
some big, blown-up photos of your mother.

200
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,157
I think they're talking about
your time in prison, Dad.

201
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,226
Oh. Okay.
Why not?

202
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,955
I mean, uh, if I don't win this thing,
I'm gonna be back there anyway.

203
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,590
"At risk male youth."
That spells "army."

204
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,498
<i>And that's when Buster
discovered a recruiting pool...</i>

205
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,730
<i>the government had been
fishing for years.</i>

206
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,433
- I may head down there too.
- Yeah, I don't know, Dad.

207
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,566
"Startled Straight."
I'm not so sure you're the guy for that.

208
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,010
But I'll look into it while I'm down
at the fair signing up for a triathlon.

209
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,378
Triathlon?
Do you know how hard a triathlon is?

210
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,079
People lose control of every bodily function.
Didn't you ever see that video?

211
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,486
It's like your mother
on New Year's Eve.

212
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,526
<i>Actually, Lucille went down faster.</i>

213
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:07,164
You're not even in shape. You're gonna
fall apart in front of everybody.

214
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,564
- You're kind of scaring me, Dad.
- You see?

215
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,036
Perfect for this "Startled Straight" thing.

216
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,232
<i>Tobias was getting Ann ready...</i>

217
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,832
<i>for the talent portion of the pageant.</i>

218
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,673
I think we need something
with a little more spectacle in the act.

219
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,613
Something that will make you
look small and pretty in comparison.

220
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,516
- A camel.
- You know, she has a really lovely singing voice.

221
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,588
I'll sing to the camel.

222
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,385
Yes. We can Google some disco songs
with the word "hump" in them.

223
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,618
- Cute.
- No, that sounds a bit racy.

224
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,060
Okay. He may be afraid of sex,
but you're not going to win without it.

225
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,189
- No, I'm not afraid of sex.
- Oh, good.

226
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,291
Go have sex with this girl right now.
Do it. Go.

227
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,133
Get in there, have some
sex with her right now.

228
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,072
I didn't think so.
Ann, you need to decide...

229
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,634
whether you want
a man or a boy.

230
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,204
- I know how I'd answer.
- Give us some room, George Michael.

231
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:01,719
- I can't breathe.
- Okay, now you're upsetting the talent. Out!

232
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,628
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had begun
training for the triathlon...</i>

233
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,164
<i>to keep from humiliating himself
in front of Rita.</i>

234
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,291
Don't ask, "Can I?"
Ask, "I can!"

235
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,302
You can control your bladder
when you're dead.

236
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,033
No blood, no oil.
There's no "I" in win!

237
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,951
<i>Michael returned confident
in his manliness...</i>

238
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,386
<i>when he ran into his son,
who was questioning his own.</i>

239
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,549
How is that pageant going?

240
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:43,526
- It turns out Ann doesn't want
me around during it. - Really?

241
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,291
Well, now you and me can go to
that fair together tomorrow after all.

242
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,424
- Yeah? - Yeah, and maybe
do some man stuff like you said.

243
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,698
Actually, I've already signed up
for the father-son triathlon.

244
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,103
Oh. Okay, great. Yeah.
I did wanna do that with you.

245
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,199
I mean, I've already promised Steve Holt.

246
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,711
- You know, he's older. It's more manly.
- You don't think I'm manly?

247
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,510
No, no, it's just, uh...

248
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,279
Darn that Annabelle!
She ruins everything.

249
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,786
<i>But the next morning, Michael awoke...</i>

250
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,020
<i>to discover every muscle in his body
was exacting revenge.</i>

251
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,652
- Oil?
<i>- And so was his brother Gob.</i>

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,629
Hey, does anyone know
why my handlebars are in my bed?

253
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,872
<i>The Church and State Fair
was in full swing.</i>

254
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,820
<i>And Lindsay watched with pride as Hope Loblaw...</i>

255
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,981
<i>Did an original number
that Lindsay herself had written.</i>

256
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,825
And now, please welcome
Annabelle Veal...

257
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:58,165
performing "We Three Kings"
with a camel tow.

258
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,612
<i>Michael arrived at the fair
sore from overtraining.</i>

259
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,874
Can't really go that high.
I'm in a lot of pain here.

260
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,143
Yeah, you know, I figured
you'd be that way.

261
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,049
So, uh, Coach gave me these.
They're, uh, pills filled with oxygen.

262
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,054
- Yeah?
- And they keep you from being incontinent.

263
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,056
Have one.
They're called oxy-incontinent.

264
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,558
<i>Steve didn't have that quite right.</i>

265
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,426
<i>But Michael thought Rita might be coming,
and he was desperate to impress her.</i>

266
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,898
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was trying
to get knocked out of the pageant.</i>

267
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,233
Pope impersonator, Church.
How has God influenced your life?

268
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,638
About just as much as Big Bird
and the Keebler elves.

269
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:42,078
Well, my faith would have been shaken
if he had taken my legs too.

270
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,582
Uh, Gob Bluth, State.

271
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,949
I was betrayed
by my brother Michael.

272
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,284
Who's your favorite
family member and why?

273
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,383
Definitely not my shallow, materialistic
mother, who only cares about looks.

274
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,555
I think we all feel that way about
our mothers. And we all have legs.

275
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,700
<i>Meanwhile, George Sr. arrived
at the Startled Straight tent.</i>

276
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,832
I'll be waiting out here
with my enlistment forms.

277
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,743
So go in there and scare them
right into my open arm!

278
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:19,841
<i>But as it turns out, the fair
had two Startled Straight tents...</i>

279
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,080
<i>and George Sr. Had wandered
into the church-sponsored one...</i>

280
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,917
You wanna be some guy's girlfriend?

281
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,461
<i>Intended to scare gay young men
into a heterosexual lifestyle.</i>

282
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,291
You wanna have some guy reach around you
in the middle of the night...

283
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,990
- start messing with your junk?
- Is he ugly?

284
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,466
No, it's pitch-black.
You don't... You don't see him.

285
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,163
It never stops, guys...

286
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,365
and everybody acts like
it's no big deal.

287
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,102
Is there a cover charge?

288
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,838
<i>And the inner beauty pageant
was down to the final three.</i>

289
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,144
Will it be
the beautiful Hope Loblaw...

290
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,276
the stalwart Annabelle Veal...

291
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,379
or the justifiably bitter
Surely Wolfbeak?

292
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,984
<i>It became clear that
Surely was going to win.</i>

293
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,461
I'm sorry.
This is wrong.

294
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:09,022
<i>And that's when Maeby
displayed some real inner beauty.</i>

295
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,364
One of these girls deserves to win.

296
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,062
<i>She can stand!</i>

297
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:17,370
- Maeby?
- That's how I know her.

298
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,639
- Let us pray.
- Oh, for God's sake.

299
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,839
Praise the Lord!

300
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,542
<i>And Michael, now feeling a little woozy...</i>

301
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,710
<i>arrived to see the triathlon course...</i>

302
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,984
<i>which consisted of several tricycles,
five inflatable pools...</i>

303
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,390
- What the hell is this?
<i>- and fathers and sons being manacled together.</i>

304
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,657
Don't let it psyche you out.
Did that oxy-incontinent set in yet?

305
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,994
You knew this is what
the race was?

306
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,934
Kind of. I mean, they change it every year
so you can't replicate it on your lawn.

307
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,164
Why did you let me
train so hard?

308
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,605
- I just thought you wanted to hang out
and do guy stuff. - This isn't guy stuff.

309
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:55,043
I don't know why I thought that
you'd wanna do this. This is stupid, huh?

310
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,014
No, Steve, Steve.
You're not going anywhere.

311
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,551
- You'll do it with me?
- We're chained together.

312
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,883
But, you know, Rita's not here yet,
and what the hell. Let's go win this thing.

313
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,549
- Let's win this thing!
- What the hell.

314
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,718
- What the hell!
- Let's win this thing. Let's go ahead and start up.

315
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,229
<i>And after the pageant,
George Michael went to congratulate Ann.</i>

316
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,028
Congratulations on coming in third.
That's amazing.

317
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,399
And I heard you're the first camel act
to ever crack the top 10 too...

318
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,404
so that's, like, a record.

319
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,340
And I'm a bit relieved,
because, um, I was...

320
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,877
I thought maybe if you came in first,
you would have outgrown me.

321
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,573
- Outgrown you.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,205
That is the term
I've been looking for.

323
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,216
<i>It seems Gob was right...</i>

324
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,116
<i>about what happens
to third place contestants.</i>

325
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,711
I met a man.

326
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,916
<i>George Michael was devastated.</i>

327
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:44,792
<i>It seemed he'd lost his girl and
his father because he wasn't man enough.</i>

328
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,627
<i>And he was faced with a choice.</i>

329
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,909
<i>Michael and Steve Holt
finished their triathlon in first place.</i>

330
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,920
<i>Of course, they were way older.</i>

331
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,320
Believe it or not,
that took about everything I got.

332
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,449
I don't know what was in that pill,
but I do not feel so great.

333
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,687
- It's gonna get a little worse
before it gets any better. - Really?

334
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,092
- We won!
- Okay.

335
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,596
- Hey, possible nephew.
- Oh, hey.

336
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,598
Michael, your son's
signing up for the army.

337
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,600
What? You signed him up
for the army?

338
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,636
Oh, my God, you're right.
If he goes in, I can get out.

339
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,762
- I've gotta get my name on his form.
- Hang on! Hey!

340
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,341
I gotta get there.
I gotta stop this.

341
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,637
Hey, you gotta do this with me.
Come on.

342
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,508
<i>And that's when Rita noticed Michael.</i>

343
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,105
Wait for me. Wait for me.

344
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,117
- Michael?
- Hey.

345
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,211
- Could you not finish?
- No, no. First place.

346
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,483
First place, I swear.
But I'm sorry, I gotta go do something.

347
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,616
- Wait, I'm dizzy.
- Uncle Mike, come on.

348
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,024
- I'll-I'll take you.
- No, no, no, no. Steve, Steve...

349
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,063
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

350
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,564
<i>And meanwhile, George Sr...</i>

351
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,329
<i>hadn't succeeded in
startling anyone but himself.</i>

352
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:02,965
I mean, there's nothing to do all day
except lift weights and fold laundry...

353
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,306
get thrown into a cage
with a bunch of sweaty men.

354
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:10,040
Excuse me.
I can't go back.

355
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,175
- I can't go back.
- I'm glad he won't be there. He's ugly.

356
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:17,415
<i>George Sr. Came across
a U.S. Army combat Humvee...</i>

357
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,423
<i>and the pope mobile...</i>

358
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,426
<i>and he decided to escape
in the bulletproof one.</i>

359
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,565
Come on.
I can't go back!

360
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,863
<i>- And Michael caught up with George Michael...</i>
- What are you doing?

361
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,494
<i>Who was three rungs away
from being in the army.</i>

362
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,698
I'm becoming a man, Dad.
Isn't that what everybody wants?

363
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,571
Of course not. Gob, can you get us
out of these chains, please?

364
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,737
Oh, so you steal my son,
and now you need me to save yours.

365
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,010
- All right, one key coming up.
- He's a magician.

366
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,880
Yeah. We-We need you
to sign this form.

367
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,850
No, it's good, Dad.

368
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,388
There's all sorts of benefits,
and it's like a family.

369
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,551
But it's also an army of one,
and it's no place for wimps.

370
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:59,688
You have a family, okay?
And I'm the wimp, not you.

371
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,427
Because I could not take
you being away in the army, all right?

372
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,197
I love you.

373
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,969
- That did it.
- He's not signing up.

374
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,772
That's too bad.
I was this close to gettin' out.

375
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,404
Hey, I think I'm gonna go get
one of those corn dog crosses.

376
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,712
- With all the "crucifixins"? All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

377
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,289
- Was that your son?
- Yes, Rita.

378
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,954
Yeah. The most important person
in the world to me.

379
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,761
You really are quite a man, Michael.

380
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,835
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

381
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,235
You're a complete and utter!@%$#.

382
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,012
<i>I can't believe we had to bleep that.</i>

383
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,013
<i>It would have been
such a nice moment.</i>

384
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,318
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

385
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,444
<i>Buster signs Steve Holt up
for the army.</i>

386
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,491
No, no, you can't. You can't.
I'm finally ready to be a father to you.

387
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,755
- I know that now.
- I don't go in for another two years.

388
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,956
Well, as your father,
can I sign something?

389
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,965
<i>And George Sr. Finds out...</i>

390
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,035
<i>- that a fake pope mobile...</i>
- I'll see you in hell!

391
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,299
<i>...can't stop real bullets.</i>

392
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,172
Thank God I wasn't in the Humvee.

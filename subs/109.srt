I'm doing a little cost-projection
analysis for a mini-mall.

7
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:29,138
Wow. That's pretty cool you
know how to do all that stuff.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,552
Yeah. Well, maybe your old man is just a little
bit cooler than you thought he was.

9
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:39,217
Stupid. Stupid chair.
Very stupid chair.

But it's also this stupid
model home furniture.

11
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:46,430
Maybe I oughta get myself one of those
nice leather chairs from work.

12
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:50,595
- People can take chairs home from work?
- Well, not everybody.

It's okay if I take a little
something from work, you know?

15
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:59,669
Yeah, but isn't that why Grandpa's in jail,
because he took things from work?

You're a good kid, you know that?

17
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:05,979
I mean, a chair costs money,
so it's like stealing, and you always say...

18

Not stealing. Not.

19
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:12,484

stealing is bad, all right?

20

but skinning cows is cool with you.

24
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:30,940
I'm fine, by the way. Frankly, your concern
is getting embarrassing.

25

- You're not even a vegetarian.

He thought I was belittling his career...

35

- but I never would do that.
- Neither would I. What career?

36

- The magic?
- Oh, the tricks. The little tricks.

37
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:12,545
- Those are great.
- Well, he didn't like my reaction to his new one.

38

Oh, sure. First you dump all over it,
now you wanna know how it's done.

43
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:34,400
- And I wanted to apologize.
- Well, he hasn't been here.

44
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:38,410
But he said he was
staying here. Oh, my God.

45

- Maybe he's staying with another woman.
- No, no, no. No, no.

- Yeah.

- I sure will, Marta.

- I will remember.

Yeah. I'll give him
the message though. Okay.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,966
- She's gone.
- Yep. Got it.

53
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,537
- You are too nice.
- Oh, come on. What was I supposed to do?

54
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:08,096
Tell her that Gob is not staying here?
Tell her Gob is screwing around on her?

55

Actually, that-that sounded okay.

Nah, you'll never be able to do it.
You're too good.

- You're the noble one.
- Thank you.

Doesn't it drive you nuts?

- Crazy. Wait. Who is? Which part?
- My mom.

62
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:31,397

she feels when her daughter's pro-leather.

Wanna go shopping with me?
I bet you could get something cool.

<i>an embarrassing brush with her.</i>

69

Your legs look exactly like mine,

70
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,826
So I'm thinking of getting a motorcycle.

71

I'm gonna need a leather jacket when I'm on
my hog and need to go into a controlled slide.

There's my little girl. I've got great news.
Daddy has the entire day off.

73
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,972
But you have every day off.
You don't have a job.

74
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:18,806
Well... [Scoffs] I don't need money to hang
out with my daughter. Where are you going?

- Gob.

81
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:51,137
Tell him Rollo wants him to
say good-bye to his legs.

82
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:07,419
- <i>[Narrator] Michael went looking for Gob.</i>
- Mom.

83
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:11,157
I'm so glad you're here. I want you to help
me break up your brother and his girlfriend.

84
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,995
Well, I'm all for that.
We've just gotta find him first.

85
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:17,264
- He's locked on the balcony.
- Oh.

86
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,839
You meant Buster.
I thought you were talking about Gob.

87
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,773
No. I will not have Buster
dating my best friend.

92
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,785
It's just... creepy.

93
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:43,295
Hi, buddy. Mom, I think
you might be overreacting.

94
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,661
She changed him as a baby.

95
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:49,224
Okay. That-That's about
the creepiest thing I've ever heard.

96
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:51,463
That's why she didn't look surprised.

97
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:55,303
You're the only child who chose a spouse
I liked, and she's the one who had to die.

98
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,310
I know. That's rough for you.
Mom, I'm looking for Gob.

99
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:01,939
There's some people after him, and I
don't know whether it's gambling or what...

100
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:05,143
but, um, they wanna break his legs.

101
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:07,652
It's a good thing he's already got
that little scooter.

102
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:11,555
[Laughs]
Oh, don't give me that look.

103
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,093
I happen to be
a more caring mother than most.

104
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:17,220
- Where's my bed?
- I put it in storage.

105
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:21,097
I guess you'll just have to decide which
Lucille you want to spend your nights with.

106
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:26,833
Okay. Before I leave this place
for the last time ever, has anyone seen Gob?

107
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:31,105
I saw him last night
at the Playtime Pizza Theater. On my date.

108
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:33,771
Of which I have
another one tonight.

109
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,247
And I'm going to
continue dating, Mom.

110
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,148
Sounds a little bit like "dating Mom."

Can't get any work, Mike.

- from every venue in town.
- Hmm.

doesn't believe in me.

Well, I don't wanna get into
that part of your life anymore.

121

Okay. Listen, I just came here to tell you
that this guy named Rollo...

122
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:39,912
pulled me over
and made some threats.

123
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,482
- What kind of threats?
- He said to say good-bye to your legs.

124
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,575
I don't know whether
this guy's a mobster, a loan shark...

125
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:47,654
- something equally scary.
- A magician.

126
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:52,021
I think you're confusing scary with silly.
This guy was frightening. He was in a limo.

127
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:56,028
No, he's a magician.
He replaced me in the Alliance.

128
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,360
<i>He's the reason I gotta</i>
<i>do my act in this hellhole.</i>

129
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,933
- Why does he wanna break your legs?
- He doesn't wanna break my legs.

130
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:03,435
- He wants to take my legs.
- l-I don't...

131
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:06,995
The legs... The bottom half of
my saw-the-lady-in-half trick.

132
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:09,268
No, not now. I'm showing him
how to do the trick.

133
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,504
<i>[Gob] Two chicks curl up in a box.</i>
<i>We call one the head and one the legs.</i>

134
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:16,105
- So that's how they do it.
- God, I gotta stop giving these things away.

135
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:17,979
The top half there,
what do you do about that?

136
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,713
- I just get a volunteer from the crowd.
- Oh, yeah?

137
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:23,449
The old top half quit when she found out
I was sleeping with the legs.

138
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:26,321
I guess word
really gets around in there.

139
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:29,624
So Rollo wants your legs, but you're
cheating on Marta with those legs.

140
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,130
Would you give me a break, please?
The legs are insanely jealous.

141
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:36,328
Is that why you haven't seen Marta for the
past few days? This is about your love life.

142
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,962
I can't believe it. Just forget it.
I came here to try to help...

143
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:43,669
- Hey, I appreciate your time.
- Great. Great.

144
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,745
You know what, Gob?

145
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:49,748
Marta is a once-in-a-lifetime
woman. She's a treasure.

146
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,045
And I don't think you're showing her
enough respect, okay?

147
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,313
She doesn't respect my career.

148
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,492
Okay.

<i>He's having sex with a woman in his act?</i>

150
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,320
I gotta tell Marta what's going on.

151
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:07,696
First of all, she'll hate you for it.
It's called shoot the messenger.

152
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,269
Secondly, it's not in your nature.
I mean, you're like Mr. Morals.

153
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,600
- You can't even take a desk chair.
- Damn it.

154

Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. You'd better
tell Gob, the legs aren't coming.

308
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,827
- Oh, my God.
- I can't believe the legs would screw him like this.

309
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:39,803
This is his one last chance. They'll never
let him in the Alliance again.

310
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:43,808
You have to do something.
This is so important to me and Gob.

311
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:49,474
Where am I gonna get a pair of beautiful
women's legs on such short notice?

312

<i>So, the trick went forward as planned.</i>

313
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:58,449
And now, my, hopefully,
lovely assistant will join me.

[George Michael] I'm okay with myself.

[Shouts, Laughs]

319
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:32,254
Mom, did you see it? I'm back in.

320
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,657
I've got the career back.

321
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:38,663
- Thank you for coming.
- <i>[Narrator] And when Lucille noticed...</i>

322
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:44,397
<i>how happy Marta had made Gob, she realized</i>
<i>how important love was to her children.</i>

323
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:48,536
- Mom.
- Hello, Buster.

324
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:51,508
If you're still mad,
I don't care. I'm in love.

325
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:54,944
I actually came to ask
Lucille something.

326
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,107
- What?
- <i>I was wondering...</i>

327
00:19:57,217 --> 00:20:00,050
if you'd like to play bridge
with me next week?

328
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,619
I'd absolutely adore it. Oh, Lucille.

329
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:09,024
Oh, God. Look at us, Buster.

330
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:12,724
We're back together again.
Lucille and Lucille.

331
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:16,131
You guys are friends again.
You can play bridge together.

- [Chuckling]

333
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,866
Could you just... just separate?

<i>the brother he swore to stop helping...</i>

336
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:38,287

337
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,818
<i>But not as good as everyone thought.</i>

338
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,933
This really worked better with the chair.

341
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:58,400
Tell me, how'd you get two Alliance-approved
assistants with such short notice?

342
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:02,572
- That was just my girlfriend and my nephew.
- [Murmuring]

343
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:04,912
Well, you're out.

344
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:08,476
- <i>And Tobias gets some good news.</i>
- I got a gig.

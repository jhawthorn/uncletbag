1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,003
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,121
<i>Michael was sharing
some very important news with his parents.</i>

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,453
I am getting married.

7
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,958
Who the hell to?

8
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,052
Who do you think? Rita.

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,757
- Her?
- Why?

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,959
First, she needs a green card
to stay in the country.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,366
- There it is.
- She needs a green card to stay in the country...

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,735
because, secondly,
we're really crazy about each other.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,638
- You hardly know her.
- I know all the important stuff.

14
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,240
She was in the Olympics.

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,207
- She's sweet, smart, beautiful. She's special.
<i>- She was special.</i>

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,979
- Are houses hard to make?
- Actually, the hardest part is finding the land.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,351
<i>But she wasn't smart.</i>

18
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,324
Instead of making houses,
maybe you should make land...

19
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,952
<i>- For Rita had only mentally progressed...</i>
- on the ocean.

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,963
<i>To the level of a first-grader.</i>

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,397
There's no land on the ocean.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,060
<i>Michael might have noticed
her disability...</i>

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,900
<i>if it had not been masked
by her English accent.</i>

24
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,442
- You're brilliant.
<i>- Yeah, she wasn't.</i>

25
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,172
She's a really good person. Everything else
is gonna be little surprises along the way.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,305
<i>With the exception of that one big one.</i>

27
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,818
- The wedding is in one month.
- Oh.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,820
- A month!
- Now, look.

29
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,085
Just because a woman gets pregnant,
it doesn't mean you have to marry her.

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,922
Too many lives have been ruined
because some cheap waitress at a HoJo...

31
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,019
said she used an IUD.

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,621
- It was Stuckey's.
- But I believed you.

33
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,963
She's not pregnant.
We haven't even slept together.

34
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,764
This is funny.

35
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,102
- He's gay!
- Where's your hand?

36
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,008
I'm having my high school ring put on it,
and my hook is stuck in the stair car.

37
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,381
Oh.

38
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,615
- Do you think getting married
will solve your sex problem?
- No, we don't have a problem.

39
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,556
- We just haven't had the right opportunity yet.
- Lindsay said Rita slept over.

40
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,685
Yes, but I gave her the bedroom
because I didn't want her to feel pressured.

41
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,959
<i>Actually, it was Michael
who felt a little pressured.</i>

42
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,966
I like to keep the light on.

43
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:19,004
That way, I can see
if you have a monster.

44
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,665
Night-night. Can you shut the door
on your way out?

45
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,674
I can't believe
you're not supporting this.

46
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,903
Because it is obvious
what she's after.

47
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,640
- Our money.
- Oh, God! Our money.

48
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:33,583
- Let's all remind ourselves
we don't have any money.
- She's already gotten our money!

49
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:37,554
Let's not forget she's the one that gave us
the idea for that ocean-top town called Bluthton.

50
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,521
Big deal. I had that same
basic idea years ago.

51
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,731
I thought you'd be happy.
I should've known better.

52
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,599
Michael, be careful.
People just see what they want to see.

53
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,069
If she loved you, she'd show it.

54
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,141
<i>Michael was worried.</i>

55
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,505
<i>His mother may have
been making sense.</i>

56
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,976
<i>So he returned home
to talk to Rita.</i>

57
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,276
- Here comes the bride!
- What are you doing in a wheelchair?

58
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,045
No, no. It's a dolly...
to help videotape your nuptials.

59
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:09,781
I don't think I need any footage of my nuptials.

60
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,689
Tobias, are you sure that this dolly isn't
related to your recent health problems?

61
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,229
Okay, so my legs and my left arm
occasionally "go to sleep."

62
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,525
And you want to call it
a health problem.

63
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,862
- Oop.
- Hey. Hey, hey!

64
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,698
I can get up myself.

65
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,931
- Here we go.
- Let me get in the dolly.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,871
No, thank you.
I don't need your help.

67
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,138
It does seem like you've been having
a lot of trouble since the hair transplants.

68
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,204
- Maybe you should see a "bubaman."
- A bubaman?

69
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,580
Oh, uh, doctor.
It's a British expression.

70
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,778
Like they say "go up box"
instead of “elevator."

71
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,287
Like when they say "poofter"
to mean "tourist."

72
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,381
- Boy, that Rita's a smarty.
- True, but it's not like anybody appreciates it.

73
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,222
- Mom and Dad do not like Rita.
- Are they crazy? She's amazing.

74
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,059
I saw her last night. She helped me
with this project I was doing.

75
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,565
<i>Maeby was struggling with a screenplay...</i>

76
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,828
<i>in her secret life as a film executive.</i>

77
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,769
- Is that a story?
- Not yet. It doesn't have an ending.

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,103
He's in LA. She's in Japan. How do I get
these two characters together?

79
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,269
- Maybe they could walk.
- Across the ocean?

80
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,280
- If it's not too deep.
- No. Deep is good.

81
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,249
People are gonna say, "What the hell
just happened? I'd better say I like it."

82
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,912
- 'Cause nobody wants to seem stupid.
- I like it.

83
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,751
<i>The Ocean Walker.</i> Holy crap.
That's gonna look good on a hat.

84
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,485
<i>And Michael caught up with his brother.</i>

85
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,084
I need a favor. As you know,
I'm gettin' married in a month.

86
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,597
- Say no more.
- Great. Are you sure that you know what...

87
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,465
- Yep, yep, yep. Got it.
- Super. Just so that we're both clear...

88
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,437
You want me to do a magic show
at the wedding. I'm on it.

89
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,508
I'm so glad we pushed
through that. No magic.

90
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,510
Why, because of the one
little screw-up last time?

91
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,308
<i>- Put her out! Put her out!</i>
<i>- Tracey! On fire! Roll!</i>

92
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,315
<i>Thank God we already did the pictures.</i>

93
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:48,012
Which reminds me that Rita shouldn't
wear any hair spray at this thing.

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,851
- I just want you to be my witness.
- You want me to...

95
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,287
be your best man?

96
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,022
It's just a signature
I need on the license.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,462
My son's not old enough.
It's... It's no big deal.

98
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,999
I will not take
this sacred duty lightly.

99
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:07,505
I am gonna get you the single healthiest
call girl that this town has ever seen.

100
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,700
This is why I'm calling it a witness
and not a best man.

101
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,902
All you gotta do is watch.

102
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,411
I'm not gonna spend
this kind of money and not watch.

103
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,744
This may have been a bad choice.

104
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,251
Hey, hello. Look at you two...
Tweedledee, Tweedledum.

105
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,345
<i>Michael didn't mean it in that way.</i>

106
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,981
<i>How could he?
He didn't even know.</i>

107
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,152
We had the best time.
She's got such an amazing fashion sense.

108
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,163
- You guys got these jackets on inside-out?
- That way, you see the label.

109
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,894
That's what you're paying for, right?
It's a great statement on fashion.

110
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,563
- Plus it doesn't tickle your neck.

111
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,971
<i>Michael took Lindsay aside
to share his concerns.</i>

112
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,170
Lindsay, when did you first realize
that you and Tobias...

113
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,179
had no chance
at a physical relationship?

114
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,512
Oh, my God. Do you think we have no chance
at a physical relationship?

115
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,917
So, just now. See, Rita and I
have not been physical yet, and...

116
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,513
You don't think she's doing this
just for a green card, do you?

117
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,560
No. She's not that kind of person.
You just haven't been alone with her.

118
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,460
Ask her to stay over
at a hotel with you tonight.

119
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,193
- She's gonna know what that means.
- That is not a bad idea.

120
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,099
Don't... Don't do that.

121
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,469
<i>And Gob began to prepare
a magic trick for Michael's wedding.</i>

122
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,543
Takes his queen...

123
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,168
and showers her with diamonds!

124
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,839
Clubs. Club sauce.

125
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,383
He covers her with club sauce.

126
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,385
That'll be my line
if that happens.

127
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,081
Is that a magic trick?
I love magic.

128
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,817
I don't appreciate
the dry British humor.

129
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,227
Please do a magic trick for me.

130
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,357
Well, I shouldn't.
I'd hate to be blamed...

131
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,994
for setting another one
of Michael's brides... on fire!

132
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,407
Oh. Lighter fluid,
like Uncle Trevor uses.

133
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,068
But wherever did it come from?

134
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,305
Okay, I've gotta get you
into an illusion at the wedding.

135
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,508
- How long can you hold your breath?
- Oh, long. One time, 20 minutes.

136
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,950
<i>Actually, her record was 20 seconds.</i>

137
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,851
You can stop it. It's okay.
I'm gonna take your word for it.

138
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,187
Now I just need to find a trick that
puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes.

139
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,888
Sorry? Did I hear the word "trick"?
And it smells a lot like lighter fluid in here.

140
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,988
I did say no tricks, Gob,
and I mean it.

141
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,432
What if I find a trick that has her
float to the altar or something?

142
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,504
No, no. Love for her to walk
and not to drown...

143
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,129
or fly through the air
or catch on fire.

144
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,970
- Is she allergic to cat fur?
- Uh, no tigers.

145
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,976
Great.

146
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,410
So, uh, Rita, um...

147
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,176
I was wondering
if maybe you and I...

148
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,718
might head down to a hotel?

149
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,051
- Maybe some alone time.
- Oh, yes.

150
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,784
- Yeah?
- Maybe our rooms could touch.

151
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:44,693
I... I was hoping maybe for more
than just our rooms to touch.

152
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,322
I was thinking maybe
we could be...

153
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,494
in the same room,
be in the same bed.

154
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,301
I see what you mean...
a real sleepover.

155
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,239
- Well, maybe.
- Okay.

156
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,834
- Really?
- Maybe I should go home and get my things.

157
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,846
I do kinda miss my jammies.

158
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,973
I think they're gonna have
a lot of that stuff there.

159
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,210
And my tiny teddy.

160
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,811
Good. Yes, get that.

161
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,823
<i>And so George Michael
drove Rita to Wee Britain.</i>

162
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,519
It's nice to be
with someone young.

163
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,324
We can listen to young people's music
for a change.

164
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,399
Great. Yeah, please.

165
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,373
<i>That's when he first grew concerned.</i>

166
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,605
<i>And Rita packed for her sleepover.</i>

167
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,047
Do you have any idea what a sleepover is?
'Cause it's not just sleep.

168
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,517
I know what it is, Trevor.
I've seen your secret magazine.

169
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,021
I want to have grown-up fun...
spoon and figgy pudding...

170
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,527
rabbit down dum,
druggeries hollow.

171
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,530
And I want to have pop-pop.

172
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,260
The very fact that you call it that
tells me you're not ready.

173
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,895
And for your information,
that's a cricket magazine.

174
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,207
Whether you like it or not,
you're still a child in many ways.

175
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,438
I got a problem with you having
sexual relations with that man.

176
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,311
<i>- So do I.</i>
- It's not your fault your parents were cousins.

177
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:15,115
But here we are, and I've been charged with
taking care of you, and I'm bloody well gonna do it.

178
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,658
Well, Michael will be my cousin soon enough,
'cause we're getting married.

179
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,317
- Married?
- Married!

180
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,555
- Totally out of the question!
- Married, married, married!

181
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,859
All right, that does it.
You're not going anywhere.

182
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,764
- I'm puttin' the invisible locks on the door.
- That's not fair.

183
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,928
- Lock, lock.
- It's not fair!

184
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,006
- It's just not fair!
- Lock, lock.

185
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,275
I gotta find a new hiding place
for that magazine.

186
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,845
<i>And Michael was waiting at the hotel.</i>

187
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,211
Hey, Dad. Just wanted
to let you know...

188
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,046
that I'm at a hotel
with my wife-to-be.

189
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:50,248
- And we're very, very much in love.
- Put her on.

190
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,315
<i>- Michael briefly considered faking the voice.</i>
- I...

191
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,361
- She's in the shower.
- I'll wait.

192
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,430
Let's wait.

193
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,268
Don't you want me
to just call you back or...

194
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,964
No. I got nowhere to go.
I'm under house arrest.

195
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,098
Let's watch something together.

196
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,435
Wow. That Blossom grew up, huh?

197
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,514
<i>Say, how's that shower comin'?</i>

198
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,776
- All right, look, she's not in the shower.
- Really?

199
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,783
She said that she'd
meet me at the hotel.

200
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,377
- I called you a little prematurely,
but she is coming. - Really?

201
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:30,986
Uh! Hey, put Rita on.

202
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,122
<i>That's when Michael finally accepted...</i>

203
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,167
<i>that Rita wasn't coming...</i>

204
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,362
<i>and that local calls
were 2.95 a minute.</i>

205
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,771
- Come on!
<i>- That's where they get you.</i>

206
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,540
<i>Michael drove to Wee Britain
to call off the wedding...</i>

207
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,346
<i>that he now realized was not based on love.</i>

208
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,250
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's Michael, Rita. Can I come in?

209
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,324
<i>- I can't let you in.</i>
- You didn't show up last night.

210
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,893
The least you can do
is talk to me face-to-face.

211
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,258
<i>I can't.
Trevor locked the door.</i>

212
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,797
<i>He doesn't want me to be with you.</i>

213
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,163
What? He locked the door?
You can't unlock this door?

214
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,499
<i>- I can't even see half the locks.</i>
- Rita? What?

215
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,768
<i>They're invisible.
Trevor's the only one who can see them.</i>

216
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,844
I've got an idea. Go next to the window.
I'm gonna climb up.

217
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,542
- Be careful.
- I will.

218
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,744
<i>And so Michael set about
rescuing the beautiful...</i>

219
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,222
<i>sweet, mentally challenged
woman he'd fallen in love with...</i>

220
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,817
<i>without realizing
she was mentally challenged.</i>

221
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,329
- Yea, Michael! Yea!
<i>- Who undid the locks?</i>

222
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,366
- Come on out.
- Trevor's back.

223
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,992
- Come on. Hop on.
- What?

224
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,832
- Hop on.
- Huh?

225
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:50,068
- Ready?
- Oh! Oh!

226
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,144
Whee! Oh!

227
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,111
Hey! Stop that!
The both of ya come back!

228
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,240
- You can't stop us.
- Nothing can stop us now.

229
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,186
Nothing in the world of man nor
beast nor time can...

230
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,453
!@%$ all!

231
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,587
<i>Reunited with Rita, Michael told
his parents he'd be getting married tomorrow.</i>

232
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,360
- We're getting married tomorrow.
- God help her if she tries to rename Bluthton.

233
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,096
I'll sink it first. I swear,
I'll sink the whole damn thing.

234
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,866
They're goin' through with it... tomorrow.

235
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:24,841
<i>But George and Lucille
had a surprise visitor.</i>

236
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,969
All right!
Where the hell is Rita?

237
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,513
- I'm her uncle.
- Let the handouts begin.

238
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,812
There's not gonna be any handouts,
and she is not gonna marry your son.

239
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,443
- You're against this marriage too.
- Well, of course I am.

240
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,284
Rita's not capable of makin'
a decision like that.

241
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,655
You are not gonna get Rita's millions
just because she's mentally challenged.

242
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,059
- Millions?
- Millions?

243
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,326
- Mentally challenged?
- Shh! It's not polite.

244
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,233
She owns all of Wee Britain
and also the Wee Britain in Cleveland.

245
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,362
'Course, we're probably
gonna lose all that...

246
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,168
if her ridiculous idea
for Sea Britain goes through.

247
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,744
We are not after her money.

248
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:04,475
And I don't think Michael
even knows about her... condition.

249
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,483
It's funny how Americans
don't pick up on that.

250
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,316
I think it's 'cause of her accent and
the plastic surgery she's been able to afford.

251
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,982
We wouldn't have this trouble
if they'd met last year.

252
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,355
I gotta put a stop to this. I'm gonna
search every bloody hotel in town.

253
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,864
Oh! Legoland.
I think they said...

254
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,934
- they were going to Legoland.
- They did say Legoland.

255
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,900
I didn't hear anything
about Legoland.

256
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,734
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

257
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
We think he may be mentally challenged.

258
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,534
- Huh?
- All right then.

259
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,944
We have got 24 hours to get them married...

260
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,176
before Michael figures out
what she really is.

261
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:44,382
This is the first time in two years
you sound like George Bluth.

262
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,122
<i>Later that night, Michael
was at the hotel with his bride-to-be.</i>

263
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,631
- Rita, I've been really looking forward to this.
- Me too.

264
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:59,033
I want to have sexual relations.

265
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,198
The mere fact that you call it that
tells me that you are ready.

266
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,674
- That's why I brought this.
<i>- Oh!</i>

267
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,211
You go ahead and whip out that tiny teddy...

268
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,873
and then we're gonna think up
a fun safe word.

269
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,213
George Michael,
I did not know that you were...

270
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,914
Um, go ahead and talk out here.

271
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,923
Just got back
from the "bumpaddle" courts.

272
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,959
Tomorrow, I'm teachin' her baseball.

273
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,926
- It might take a while.
- Sorry?

274
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,395
Listen, Dad, th-this is... hard...

275
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,659
This is hard for me to say.

276
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,795
I was videotaping Rita. Let's just say it
would be cute if it was someone much younger.

277
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,002
I'm sorry. Maybe I should get another tape.
They're not expensive.

278
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,249
That's the plastic fruit, Dad.

279
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,980
It's very convincing fruit. Okay?

280
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:53,354
And... She's goin'
back in for another?

281
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,361
You know, they don't even have bananas
in England. Okay, Son?

282
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,795
Now, I know this is hard for you...

283
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,630
but it would be nice
to be supported in some...

284
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,704
Now she's goin' into the grapes.

285
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,170
Yeah. She really liked those.

286
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,538
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,511
I think she might be...
retar-retarded.

288
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,479
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

289
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,654
Say hello to my tiny teddy.

290
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,855
Tiny Teddy? Oh!

291
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,227
<i>And that's when it dawned on Michael.</i>

292
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,130
- Oh, you teach kids, huh?
- I like to think they teach me.

293
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,794
That way I can see
if you have a monster.

294
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,572
Be careful.


295
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,917
I have made a huge mistake.

296
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,388
<i>Michael had just been shown...</i>

297
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,465
<i>that his fiancée
might be mentally challenged.</i>

298
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,262
- So, <i>- But he needed proof.</i>
- are you ready for lie-down kisses with me?


299
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,633
Maybe we oughta just talk a little bit.

300
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,673
I mean, what the heck?
For instance, you've never told me...

301
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,265
how many houses there are
in the British Parliament.

302
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,675
- Seven.
- Are there?

303
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,509
<i>- The answer is three.</i>
- Does sound about right.

304
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,708
<i>Three is the correct answer.</i>

305
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,582
- Rita... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on. Let's have our fun!

306
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,145
Rita corny Michael.

307
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,283
<i>So Michael used a line
that was just as corny.</i>

308
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,885
You know,
I think that we should wait...

309
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,261
until after we're married.

310
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,299
Married!
Married, married, married!

311
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,702
Okay! Night-night!

312
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:52,539
<i>And Michael felt he deserved
a $15 thing of candy beans.</i>

313
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,342
<i>The next morning, however,
as Michael prepared to let Rita down gently...</i>

314
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,921
<i>- he was met with another surprise.</i>
- Surprise!

315
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,651
- What's this?
- We're throwing you a wedding.

316
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,889
- Oh, how lovely!
- On us.

317
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,726
Everything you see.
Show him the waffle bar, Larry.

318
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,562
- It's over there.
- And check out banner, Michael.

319
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,432
I'm gonna go set up.

320
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,166
I was just gonna talk to Rita
about all of this.

321
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:26,904
Rita, I think that we should, um,
wait a little while.

322
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,412
Wait? Why?
I don't wanna wait.

323
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:35,181
I want to get married and have
sexual relations like you promised.

324
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,984
Where did you get this firecracker?
I love her, Michael.

325
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,616
So do I. I wanna kiss
my new daughter-in-law.

326
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,321
- Hey, not on our time, Larry.
- Right on the lips.

327
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,127
- No, no. Please, take it easy.
- I'm gonna get my dress from the... from the room.

328
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,428
Yes. I'll help you
put it on inside-out.

329
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,403
Let's... Let's not all get, um...

330
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,269
Mom, what's goin' on? I thought
you guys were against all this.

331
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,343
Well, we feel
that you know best...

332
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,174
and who are we to interfere,
and you love this girl.

333
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,477
And the rest will just be
little happy surprises...

334
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,381
- along the way, like you said.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,614
With the exception
of the retard thing.

336
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,453
- Oh, God.
- Tell me you didn't just say that.

337
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,651
You knew?

338
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,392
You knew, yet you still wanted me
to go through with this.

339
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,797
What can I say?
I'm crazy about the little dullard.

340
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,960
Oh, my God. She's rich.

341
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,005
This is a new low,
even for you, Mom.

342
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,477
What is wrong with you?

343
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,478
Larry, go to a mirror.

344
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,179
- You're fired.
- You're fired. What?

345
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,015
It's over. And this is how you tell me...
in the middle of a wedding?

346
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,147
<i>You shouldn't have said anything.</i>
You <i>shouldn't have said anything.</i>

347
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,316
You were right.
Now what am I gonna do?

348
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,021
I've been thinking. Every society
has their own rules about this stuff.

349
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,826
For instance, in some states,
it's legal to marry your own cousin.

350
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,925
California's blocked it twice, but only because
they tacked it onto an estate law thing.

351
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,334
- We had the signatures.
- You're 16, and you know all that.

352
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,408
She's 30 and a half. She probably can't list
the seven houses of Parliament.

353
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,773
- There's three.
- Now I gotta break her heart.

354
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,506
Doesn't she have to leave the country
if you don't marry her?

355
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,879
Yeah, I guess I can keep my promise
about that, huh?

356
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,952
There wouldn't be any
real intimacy...

357
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,953
and it would be the strongest marriage
in the family.

358
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:21,549
But as much as I'd like to, you can't ignore
the fact that she is mentally disabled.

359
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,685
Oh, my God.

360
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,099
I'm wearing an inside-out
bridesmaid's dress.

361
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,863
- You'd better catch her, Dad.
- Not gonna be easy. She's an Olympic silver...

362
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,131
I just figured that one out.

363
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,803
Okay. Well, I have to go stop production
on <i>The Ocean Walker.</i>

364
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,883
- You found out.
- Took me long enough.

365
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:52,821
Maybe you're not smart either.
I didn't know until they told me.

366
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,088
No. I'm just a narcissist
who was too self-involved to see the truth.

367
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,890
That makes no sense to me.

368
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,829
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm being too hard on myself.

369
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:05,029
You know, the truth is...
is that I did just see what I wanted to see.

370
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,573
Rita, you're so beautiful,
and you're so sweet.

371
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,474
And you deserve to find somebody
a lot more like you.

372
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,775
I don't think that either one of us
would be happy.

373
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,974
So, it's bye-bye to Rita then?

374
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,415
Unless you really want
to stay in America.

375
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,478
- I wanted to be with you.
- Hoy! Rita!

376
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,684
Time to go now.
Back to England, love.

377
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,921
Oh, Michael, will you
come visit me lots?

378
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,430
That's gonna be difficult, Rita.
You're gonna be across an ocean.

379
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,093
- Well, you can always walk.
- Not on the water.

380
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,433
Oh, Michael, you're such a grown-up.

381
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,279
Hey! He-Hey!

382
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,043
Hang on a sec.
That's part of your trick, right?

383
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,646
No. That's not my trick, Michael.

384
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,223
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

385
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,027
It's my <i>illusion!</i>

386
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>Michael relives a wedding nightmare.</i>

387
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,796
- Help! Put him out!
- My hair! My beautiful hair!

388
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,170
- Push him in the pool!
- Why am I not going underwater?

389
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,643
Dear God! Why am I not going underwater?

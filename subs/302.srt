1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,661
<i>Previously on</i> Arrested Development.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,831
<i>Michael and his son were
camping out at the family cabin...</i>

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:11,843
<i>- before it was to be relocated.</i>
- I'm just in the middle of a stupid girl problem.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,005
I don't even have a girl,
much less a stupid one.

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,345
No, the problem is stupid.
The girl isn't stupid.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,918
<i>But if they ever had a child, it would be...</i>

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,783
<i>because the girl
was his cousin Maeby.</i>

8
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,914
Tomorrow morning, before we tell
the cops that that's not Pop-Pop in prison...

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,220
we're gonna go down
to the lake, we're gonna discuss...

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,295
your girl problem man-to-man,
and it's gonna be fun.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,296
Especially the part about the cops.

12
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,923
<i>But Pop-Pop had other plans...</i>

13
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:39,561
<i>and Michael awoke to find
his camping trip going south.</i>

14
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,197
Well, you better get up now
if you want to see the lake.

15
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,112
<i>And that was when George Sr.
Made a desperate plea.</i>

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,704
Promise me you won't
send me back to prison...

17
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,252
so I can be with my dear love Lucille...

18
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,253
in the twilight of her face.

19
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,153
<i>Michael didn't send his father back to prison...</i>

20
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,716
<i>but instead arranged for him
to be placed under house arrest.</i>

21
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,887
George, we're never going to be...

22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,897
out of each other's sight.

23
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,229
<i>Which made this woman his warden.</i>

24
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,997
Oh, dear God.
Send me back to prison.

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,164
- You gotta send me back to prison.
- More touching.

26
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,976
<i>Michael went to
his parents’ penthouse to discuss...</i>

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,572
<i>his father's ever-worsening
legal situation.</i>

28
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,583
- Where is everybody?
- How should I know, Michael?

29
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,483
As soon as Father came back,
I've been like the Invisible Man.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,523
"Hello! Can anyone see me?"

31
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,491
- Where's your hand, anyway?
- Why even bother getting dressed up?

32
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,586
- I have no one.
- Buster, come on now.

33
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,597
If you're really lonely, maybe
it's time you went out there...

34
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,327
and you got yourself
a girlf... A pet.

35
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,926
- How about a turtle?
- Great.

36
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,939
I've always loved those
leathery little snappy faces.

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,941
You certainly have a type.

38
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,511
Mother, have you seen
my rubber hand?

39
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,445
Oh, it's in the dishwasher. Your father
and I were using it for something.

40
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,448
Oh, for God's sake.

41
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,987
- Can't you keep my hand to yourself?
- Uh, "used it for something"?

42
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,113
He's just jealous that I have
a man back in my life.

43
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,216
And guess what else is back.

44
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,229
- My breakfast?
- My friskiness.

45
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,496
- Mama horny, Michael.
- No, it's my breakfast.

46
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,572
I'm amazed Dad hasn't strangled
himself with his belt yet.

47
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,039
Oh, we're into all kinds of freaky stuff.

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,203
Why do I eat breakfast before I come here?

49
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,576
What the hell is this?

50
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,081
Well, now that Dad's back,
I'm going to perform...

51
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,813
one grand illusion for him
before he strangles himself with his belt.

52
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,321
- No, no. Turns out they're into that.
- Oh.

53
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,256
Well, check it.
The illusion is called "Free Bird."

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,319
A magical bird... me in a beak...
stands on a platform.

55
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,762
There's a puff of smoke, then I'm gone.

56
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,063
Then seconds later, high above
in a once-empty cage...

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,695
- Who should appear?
- A guy that kind of looks like you?

58
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,330
No. Not how I do the trick.

59
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,740
Even if it was, how'd
the look-alike get up there?

60
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,040
- He was hiding behind this mirror here?
- No!

61
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,377
For your information,
Dad asked me to do this...

62
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,383
on the day he pleads not guilty...

63
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,612
as a spectacular protest.

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,950
A "protest-acular."

65
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,354
Maybe even get it
on the local news.

66
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,188
Excuse me. I was just
looking for a marker...

67
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,526
A Magic Marker.

68
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,464
I want it out of my living room.
Put it in Buster's room.

69
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,162
That's where she keeps things
she has no need for.

70
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,431
Oh, God.

71
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,939
I'm gonna run this through again
on "Pots and Pans."

72
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,739
You know, Gob, instead of trying to impress
a father that couldn't care less about you...

73
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,745
why don't you try spending
some time with your son...

74
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,145
who's dying to reconnect with you?

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,582
<i>Gob had discovered
he was the father of this boy.</i>

76
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,247
- Well, then just tell him that Steve Holt stopped by, okay?
- Okay.

77
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,256
<i>He'd been ducking him ever since.</i>

78
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,725
Tom? Come on over here.
I've got a vitamin for you.

79
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,319
- He's the one who can't see me.
- Because you were hiding in the trick?

80
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,992
Illusion, Michael.

81
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,069
I so very much would like to be...

82
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,070
in your "prostate-icular"...

83
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,970
- as your look-alike.
- Right.

84
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,066
They're gonna see the ink.
It's more of a leading man role.

85
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,611
But it's not really done that way.

86
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,173
Guess I shouldn't have
used a permanent marker.

87
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,479
Starting to see why
you want that divorce.

88
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,919
Yeah, well, actually,
I've been thinking.

89
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,923
Instead of spending money
on a divorce...

90
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,654
which can be slow...
well, maybe I should get something faster.

91
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,753
Not the car.
I said no to the Volvo.

92
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,856
The Lexus. The Volvo didn't have
satellite radio, which is crazy.

93
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,867
I mean, what are we, Amish?

94
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,834
I knew you wouldn't have the guts
to go through with the divorce.

95
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,600
You're one to talk. You haven't had
a serious relationship since your wife.

96
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,438
And... you guys weren't even
speaking toward the end.

97
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,843
- Lot of that was the coma.
- Yeah. I've heard your side of it.

98
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,940
You haven't had the guts to meet someone else.

99
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,851
- Uh...
- Look who finally got his pants on.

100
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,855
You've got 10 minutes.

101
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,925
You gotta get me out of here.

102
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,119
You're the one that said no to prison.

103
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,061
I was wrong. There you just had
to shut your eyes and take it.

104
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,224
Here you have to shut your eyes
and give it. Now listen.

105
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,234
We can't just go in there
and plead not guilty.

106
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,237
We have to have someone big
behind us. Our own private Matlock.

107
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,204
So I made some calls, and I got him.

108
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,469
- Got who?
- Andy Griffith.

109
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,874
- What, you never saw Matlock?
- Not a real attorney, Dad.

110
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,047
Now, for 10 grand, he'll actually...

111
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,709
sit behind us in court
and read the paper.

112
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,912
For 15, he'll actually sit
at the defense table.

113
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,649
For $20,000, he'll twice...

114
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,989
lean forward
and whisper something in your ear.

115
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,154
Oh. White suit...
That's extra.

116
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,700
Well, that's an awful lot of money
for the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

117
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,326
- The juries love him.
- That's just it, Dad.

118
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,736
There won't be a jury
because we are pleading guilty.

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,207
I am not guilt...
I didn't want to tell you this.

120
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,404
- Ready for the bombshell?
- Andy Griffith wasn't the bombshell?

121
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,074
I'm a patsy.
I was set up... by the Brits.

122
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,585
A group of British builders
operating outside the OC...

123
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,587
- Don't call it that.
- Contacted me...

124
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,055
for a partnership
to build homes overseas.

125
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,854
I did not know they meant Iraq.

126
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,758
We've got a picture of you
with Saddam Hussein.

127
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,889
I thought that was the guy
who played the Soup Nazi.

128
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,559
- Come on.
- I told him how much I liked his work.

129
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,365
The Brits used that picture
to blackmail me.

130
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,134
A picture like that, Michael,
can end your career.

131
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,801
Not in every case.

132
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,901
These are dangerous people, Michael.
They'll do whatever it takes...

133
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,537
to get inside this family
and just bring us down.

134
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,550
- British people.
- Oh, they're polite and the men all sound gay...

135
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,212
but they will rip out
your heart and...

136
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,291
- Their breath...
- And you want to go after these people?

137
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,724
Well, yes, it takes
a little courage, Michael.

138
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,727
I know that's not
your strongest suit.

139
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,230
You're... You're even scared
to ask a girl out on a date.

140
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,166
Wh... Why does everybody
think that I'm scared of girls?

141
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,998
- Because you're a chicken. You're a chicken.
- No, I'm not.

142
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:50,064
What are you doing?

143
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,235
Michael and women?

144
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,939
That's what I was just telling him.

145
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,947
Look, I haven't found the right girl.

146
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,949
When I do, I will ask her out.

147
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,781
Has anyone in this family
ever even seen a chicken?

148
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,015
Wait, wait. I've got the perfect thing!

149
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,751
That's enough.
I will give it one day.

150
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,350
All right? I'll see if there's any
evidence of these nefarious Brits.

151
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,488
But I'm warning you...
If I can't, we're pleading guilty.

152
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,863
You're either going to jail, of if the judge
shows absolutely no mercy at all...

153
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,198
you'll be staying here with my mother.

154
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,864
Lindsay, I didn't want to tell you earlier,
but I did get you a car.

155
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,601
- Is it the Lexus?
- It's more like a Lincoln.

156
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,119
Oh, come on!

157
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,053
There's no satellite radio,
but there's a banjo in the closet.

158
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,317
And watch out for live-ins.

159
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,019
You will get some live-ins.

160
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,832
<i>Michael was investigating his father's case...</i>

161
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,032
<i>in the English section
of Orange County.</i>

162
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,041
Lanes reverse!

163
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,737
You're driving on the wrong side,
you bloomin' idiot!

164
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,677
I need to check the records...

165
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,646
for any British-owned
building businesses...

166
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,309
that would have applied for license
about 10 years ago.

167
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,685
Oh, I'm so sorry. You need
a U.K. Passport to check those files.

168
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,588
They're for British eyes only.

169
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,526
Don't I look kind of British?

170
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,655
Perhaps if you're willing
to lose 20 pounds.

171
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,665
<i>The clerk was asking for a bribe...</i>

172
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,533
<i>- but this was lost on Michael.</i>
- You guys do go for the jugular.

173
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,038
If you find someone with a passport,
we're here till 8:00...

174
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,665
and do stay for the Poppins.

175
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,676
<i>So Michael went to the local pub...</i>

176
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,042
- Bloody Yank!
<i>- to see if he could find someone...</i>

177
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,741
<i>- with a British passport.</i>
- Welcome to the Yellow Fang.

178
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,284
I am Lionel, and the soup of the day is...

179
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,581
What's the soup of the day, Mum?

180
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,021
- Bread.
- And the soup of the day is bread...

181
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,093
Unless you’re just here for the Poppins.

182
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,857
<i>And that's when Michael saw
the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.</i>

183
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,898
<i>Not her.</i>

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,900
<i>Wait for it.</i>

185
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,132
Are you from Wee Britain?

186
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,211
Great Britain, actually.

187
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,247
I was wondering if you might
be willing to go somewhere with me.

188
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,216
- I will pay you.
- You'll pay me?

189
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,016
Not... Not for sex. You're gonna think
that I'm Jack the Ripper, right?

190
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,490
- Didn't he kill prostitutes or...
- I'm not a prostitute.

191
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,460
Then I shall let you live.

192
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,726
This is my worst hello.
Let me try again.

193
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,232
- My name is Michael.
- Rita.

194
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,235
So I need access to these files...

195
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,532
that are apparently
for British eyes only.

196
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,303
Well, lucky for you,
my whole face is British.

197
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,078
It's just across the street.
I really appreciate... Hello.

198
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,481
- I thought you said you were open till 8:00.
- Oh, yes... GMT.

199
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,487
Everything here is on Greenwich mean time.

200
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,183
What a curious street.

201
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,193
Uh... Wait, wait, Rita. I don't suppose
that you're here tomorrow morning?

202
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,287
Oh, no. Not in the morning, no.
I'll be back at Slowbrooke.

203
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,299
Slowbrooke... The private school.
You teach kids, huh?

204
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,460
I like to think they teach me.

205
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,130
- Like what? How to eat crayons, throw tantrums...
- Oh, no.

206
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,037
Not when I'm there.
I'm very good.

207
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:14,135
I didn't mean to impugn
your ability or, uh...

208
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,646
It's turning into one of my worst good-byes.

209
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,047
Farewell, and, uh...

210
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,779
our paths shan't cross again.

211
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,287
As you like it.

212
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,153
<i>Michael would have walked away forever...</i>

213
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,123
<i>but he was struck by
something he remembered...</i>

214
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,821
<i>- from his childhood.</i>
- You know...

215
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,728
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the flight of the Mary Poppins.</i>

216
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,996
<i>- Mary Poppins will take...</i>
- Well, must be the Poppins.

217
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,197
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's wrong to laugh.

218
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,707
No, no, it was good. I liked it.
I was just gonna ask you...

219
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,709
Pre-schools just go half day, right?

220
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm not trying to pick you up, but
is there any way that I can come by...

221
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,645
- pick you up, bring you here?
- Yeah, l... I, uh...

222
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,312
I suppose I could sneak out at nap time.

223
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,321
- Yes? Perfect. Great.
- Mmm.

224
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,653
And I shall drop you
off alive, hooker or no.

225
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,761
<i>Tobias, still hoping to be in Gob's trick...</i>

226
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,597
<i>- ventured into a costume shop he'd stumbled upon...</i>
- Oh, look who's back.

227
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,035
<i>- years earlier.</i>
- Are you gonna buy this time, or you just curious?

228
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,767
I suppose I'm, uh, buy-curious.

229
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,843
I have a big TV opportunity.

230
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,070
This is where all the big TVs come.

231
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,945
- Uh, let's start with the Eve Arden.
- All right.

232
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,950
<i>Michael, meanwhile, called his sister.</i>

233
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,215
I wanted to tell you that I got myself
a date with a beautiful woman...

234
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,757
named Rita, and you're the chicken, not me.

235
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,190
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck...

236
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,060
Okay. That's a pretty good chicken.

237
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,309
Watch out!

238
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,073
Crazy Brit!

239
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,274
What's the problem?

240
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,283
I know what you were
doing back there.

241
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,285
And if you've got half
a!@%$# brain...

242
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,550
- you'll leave it alone.
- You talking about back in Wee Britain?

243
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,557
- I was just asking a few questions.
- Yeah...

244
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,559
A few too many, if you ask me.

245
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,221
How would you like someone going
after some stupid person in your family?

246
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,094
Now, back off, you!@%$# ponce!

247
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,463
Wow.

248
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,131
Dad was not kidding
about their breath.

249
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,244
<i>Michael had just been threatened...</i>

250
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,779
<i>by a foul-mouthed British man.</i>

251
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,781
It's Michael. I'm not dressed.

252
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,249
Gob, this is Michael.

253
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,513
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for your "Free Bird" trick?

254
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,589
- I couldn't get the rights to "Free Bird."
- Oh.

255
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,318
I'm thinking about calling it "Free..."
I don't know. "Chicken."

256
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,259
I thought you were investigating Dad's
sinister British connection.

257
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,262
Yeah. I, uh, tried, but, uh...

258
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,264
when I was leaving...

259
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,494
one of those British guys
came after me and told me to back off.

260
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,696
Can't believe it, but Dad
may have been telling the truth.

261
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,603
- This might be dangerous.
- So you came back here to hide like a child.

262
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,439
- What are you doing locked in my office, exactly?
- Hiding from a child.

263
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,604
- Big difference.
- Gob, Steve Holt is your son.

264
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,274
- He probably just feels a connection.
- He doesn't know what he feels.

265
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,283
I'm tried of being told.

266
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,618
My God.
What is this feeling?

267
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,691
You know, the feeling that you're...

268
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,852
that you're feeling, it's just
what many of us call a feeling.

269
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,861
It's not like envy...

270
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,864
- Or even hungry.
- Could it be love?

271
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,163
I know what an erection feels like, Michael.
No. It's the opposite.

272
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,465
It's like my heart is getting hard.

273
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,202
Maybe I am ready to be a father.

274
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,368
- Hey, Dad?
- Whoa!

275
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,469
It's my son, Gob.

276
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,175
You know, and what is it with the fathers
in this family always trying to deceive their...

277
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,650
<i>And that's when
Michael realized that the man...</i>

278
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,278
<i>who threatened him
must have been hired by George Sr.</i>

279
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,357
I'm the patsy.

280
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,626
Well, I gotta go.
George Michael?

281
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,594
I'm sorry, but we're gonna talk
about that girl later, okay?

282
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,597
Now all I have to do
is find that look-alike, Michael.

283
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,599
Michael?

284
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,400
Hey!

285
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,669
That's a woman's wig.

286
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,675
I was told it was a bob.

287
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,774
<i>- And Michael confronted his father.</i>
- Find out anything?

288
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,782
Yeah, I found out no matter
how many times I promise myself...

289
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,784
I'm not gonna fall for it,
I always end up...

290
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,911
- getting hustled by you.
- What are you talking about?

291
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,785
The guy that you hired to threaten me
after I looked into the British connection.

292
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,756
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Somebody threatened you?

293
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,885
It's a wonderful performance.
You're a regular Brad Garrett.

294
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,860
But I don't watch TV
at 3:00 in the afternoon...

295
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,693
and you can forget
about pleading not guilty.

296
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,359
- Guilty. We gotta plead guilty.
- What?

297
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,800
Michael, I didn't hire anyone,
I... I swear.

298
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,771
If someone came after you,
they're for real.

299
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,775
- Come on. You serious?
- I told you. These are bad guys.

300
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,107
They do not want
this information out.

301
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,373
He said he was gonna come
after somebody stupid in our family.

302
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,473
- That could be Buster.
- Could be Gob.

303
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,451
- You're not guilty.
- We have to plead guilty.

304
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,387
- We gotta plead guilty.
- We gotta throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.

305
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,755
- We gotta get Andy Griffith.
- In the suit.

306
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,885
<i>And Michael went to cancel with Rita.</i>

307
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,430
Sorry. I just wanted
to let you know...

308
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,965
that I'm not gonna be needing
your passport after all.

309
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,399
We're just gonna go to court, plead guilty.
That'll be that.

310
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,132
- So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?
- Yes, I'll shake your hand good-bye...

311
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,801
but, actually, I was wondering
if you might want to...

312
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,142
I wouldn't. I'll make you blue.

313
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,182
<i>Rita was just talking about the finger paint...</i>

314
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,514
<i>- but Michael didn't know that.</i>
- I was just wondering...

315
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,453
if you might want to bid me fair morrow.

316
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,253
<i>Michael was filled with self-loathing.</i>

317
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,456
<i>Had he been Jack the Ripper,
he would have soothed himself...</i>

318
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,032
<i>in a most unsavory way.</i>

319
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,193
<i>But instead he just
sat in his car...</i>

320
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,500
<i>and ate a whole thing
of candy beans.</i>

321
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,235
<i>And back at the penthouse,
Gob had been called to see his father.</i>

322
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,243
New plan, right?

323
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,337
<i>You put me in the trick.
You make me the guy in the cage.</i>

324
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,507
Okay, I just gotta say
I'm really blown away by this.

325
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,848
You really want to be part of my world.

326
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,448
- I do.
- God, I feel like my heart is straining through my shirt.

327
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,719
They take the ankle monitor off
when I get to court.

328
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,694
So, you make me disappear,
you put Tobias in the cage...

329
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,698
and by the time they realize
that that guy is not me...

330
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,394
I'm running through
the storm drains to freedom.

331
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,993
Where every day it rains...

332
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,539
pennies from heaven!

333
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,375
It was a... bird day...

334
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,382
Gob, I know you're looking
for a twin for your illusion...

335
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,317
and there's somebody
I'd like to put in a plug for.

336
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,379
Uh... Correction.
Make that 4,000 plugs.

337
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,220
- Oh, God!
- Oh, come on.

338
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,725
Mr. Gay, he's bleeding.
Mr. Gay...

339
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,388
No, no, no, no...
I was scared too...

340
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,489
but I realized it was
of being a leading man.

341
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,195
Oh, I can just taste those meaty
leading-man parts in my mouth.

342
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,273
All right, listen to me. The trick
has changed. We want you to play me now.

343
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,775
Oh, but that would mean
I'd have to sh...

344
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,573
Shave my very...
tender head. I see.

345
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,376
Okay. Well, perhaps
I jumped the gun...

346
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,383
on those new head shots.

347
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,844
<i>And later that day,
Michael arrived at the courthouse.</i>

348
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,981
I can't believe you're
just giving up like this.

349
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,059
Well, the guy threatened our family.
We have to plead guilty.

350
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,128
No, I'm talking about that girl
you said you have a date with.

351
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,197
All right, so I lied.
It wasn't a date.

352
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,197
But you could have
made one with her.

353
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,460
I think that Poppins knocked
the courage out of you.

354
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,468
I guess I'm just not in her league.

355
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,561
- How did you hear about the Poppins?
- It was on the news.

356
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,698
An unlicensed Mary Poppins
takes down another tourist.

357
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,371
Is this the work of the Itsy Bitsy IRA?

358
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,380
I don't want to talk about this.

359
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,541
Dad, we're gonna go in there,
Andy Griffith's gonna whisper something.

360
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,551
We're gonna plead guilty.
Nice and simple.

361
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,121
- You didn't hear. We lost Andy.
- What are you talking about?

362
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,214
- He didn't like his trailer.
- He thought we were making fun of him.

363
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,486
<i>No one was making fun of Andy Griffith.</i>

364
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,562
<i>I can't emphasize that enough.</i>

365
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,632
Oh, God. Don't look now...

366
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,634
but Gob's doing his magic show.

367
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,762
Oh, boy, a stupid magic show.
We gotta watch this.

368
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,968
- A big turnout.
- A lot of people are probably here for the free chicken.

369
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,977
Gather round, humans...

370
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,979
and I will show you the plight...

371
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,015
of an innocent man
who yearns to be...

372
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,313
free as a bird!

373
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,820
I've gotta start labeling these suits.

374
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,687
Who shall I send on this journey...

375
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,283
to that dangling cage?

376
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,331
Oh, pick me. Look, could I be
in this stupid trick?

377
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,491
- Please?
- Steve Holt, what are you doing here?

378
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,967
I just came to see the magic show.

379
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,970
I didn't know it was you.

380
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,200
- Do you like magic?
- No.

381
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,675
- I love it.
<i>- And at that moment...</i>

382
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,009
<i>Gob chose to show his own son
what he was capable of.</i>

383
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,379
I've decided I will be
performing the feat...

384
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,384
myself.

385
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,320
<i>- Wait. We're back to hair?</i>
- Fortunately for Tobias, however...

386
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,519
<i>- he'd found it too painful
to part with his new hair.</i>

387
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,030
- Boy. Did I catch a break.
<i>- So he opted to wear a bald cap.</i>

388
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,123
This chicken...

389
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,862
shall be wrongly cooped.

390
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,707
- Is that a chicken?
- Oh, my God.

391
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,007
- Dad, are you all right?
- I fooled his own son.

392
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,708
I am a leading man.

393
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,012
<i>And Gob himself
was running through the storm drains...</i>

394
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,212
I'm sorry, Steve.

395
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,152
<i>- free as a chicken.</i>
- I need to be a father.

396
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,193
<i>And George Sr. needed to escape too.</i>

397
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,694
I got him.

398
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,598
Keeps him out of the kitchen.

399
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,601
<i>And Michael,
seeing what a life of cowardice leads to...</i>

400
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,830
<i>decided he'd had enough of it.</i>

401
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,737
<i>And soon George Sr. came to,
and it was time...</i>

402
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,742
<i>- to render a plea.</i>
- Oh, no.

403
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,074
Prosecution's got that stud from L.A. Law.

404
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,047
- It's Harry Hamlin.
- I love my trailer.

405
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,242
In the matter of The People v. Bluth...

406
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,754
- how do you plead?
- We plead... not guilty.

407
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,016
Order in the court!

408
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,025
- Who let a flashbulb camera in?
- What are you doing?

409
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,187
I'm tired of the cowardice. You're not guilty.
We're gonna fight this.

410
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,561
They don't have a!@%$# prayer.

411
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,033
Send the check to my accountant.

412
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,731
- This is where Andy could have helped us.
- I'm proud of you.

413
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,739
It's about time I showed a little courage.

414
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,775
I just hope those Brits
aren't as dangerous as Dad said.

415
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,777
Well, they're not gonna
get any closer to us.

416
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,110
If they do, we're gonna see them coming.
Oh, my God. That's Rita.

417
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,617
I told her I was coming here and she came.

418
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,448
- That's Rita?
- Yeah.

419
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,790
Wow. She is way out of his league.

420
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,623
I'm glad you're here.

421
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,323
I wanna call you sometime
and take you out.

422
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,400
Oh.

423
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,491
I'd really like that.

424
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,800
<i>And then, just to prove
to himself he wasn't a coward...</i>

425
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,776
<i>he went one step further.</i>

426
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,484
<i>And Rita was happy
to be in Michael's life as well.</i>

427
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,487
<i>For you see, Rita
had a secret of her own.</i>

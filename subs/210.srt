1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:05,369
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,463
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,565
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,742
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,580
<i>Michael Bluth arrived home</i>
<i>to find his mother, Lucille...</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,852
- <i>in a state of agitation.</i>
- I think the company's in trouble.

7
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,325
What tipped you?
The falling profits...

8
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,488
or that we're a regular feature on Bill O'Reilly's
"Most Ridiculous Item of the Day"?

9
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm talking about the fact that my "friend"
Lucille Austero bought our company...

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,568
and I think she's going for
a power grab, that <i>bitch!</i>

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,106
You're not at home, Mom.
She doesn't live next door when you're here.

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,507
Secondly, she's already grabbed power.
She's the majority shareholder of the company.

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,013
Your brother Gob.

14
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,414
<i>In fact, Lucille 2</i>
<i>was already with Gob-</i>
- You look really nice.

15
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,352
- <i>but she was growing tired ofhis neediness.</i>
- Where are you going?

16
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,355
I'm going to my spin class.

17
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,357
Thought you had vertigo.

18
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,553
<i>She'll sell the company or break it up</i>
<i>into little parts or something...</i>

19
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,927
all under the guise of
"caring" about our family.

20
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,025
Gotta stop quoting when you drink.
I certainly hope she's not planning a move.

21
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:14,402
I wouldn't put it past her.
She'd love to get at me any way she could.

22
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,407
That's why she's been
flirting with Gob.

23
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,104
She's trying to prove that she's closer
to my children than I am...

24
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,705
but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know
how little I care for Gob.

25
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,048
Think that makes the joke on Gob.

26
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,087
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,089
Was that Gangy who was just-

28
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,991
You all right? Sorry.
Your grandmother had a little accident here.

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,825
Oh. Does that mean she's gonna
have to come live with us?

30
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,799
No, no. No. It was- It was her drink,
and even if it wasn't, just-

31
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,870
Do you remember when I bid on Sally Sitwell
at the bachelorette auction?

32
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,600
They sent me this basket with all this stuff
for our date, you know. It's a whole package.

33
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,677
I thought that maybe we could do it
together, like a Valentine's present.

34
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,008
- You're not gonna take Sally?
- Sally, no. No.

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,514
L-I wanted it for us.
I never wanted to be with Sally.

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,585
<i>Actually, Michael</i>
<i>had gone over to Sitwell Enterprises</i>-

37
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:03,850
- Michael Bluth to see Sally.
- <i>one day earlier to set up a date with Sally.</i>

38
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,291
I'm afraid she's not here. If you'd like me
to take the package, I can give it to her.

39
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:13,623
No, no. This is, uh-
This is not for her. It's for my son.

40
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,099
Just don't tell her I came by.

41
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,466
<i>In fact, Sally wasn't there...</i>

42
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,869
<i>and the person Michael saw</i>
<i>was her father.</i>

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,535
- You kidding? This makes me
look like my daughter.
- <i>No one's going to think that.</i>

44
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,579
I look like Edgar Winter.
Forget it. I gotta get to spin class.

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,013
<i>So what do you say?</i>
<i>We got a basketful of father-son fun here.</i>

46
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,780
- What's Kama Sutra oil?
- Maybe it's not for us.

47
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,119
<i>Ah, Valentine's Day, which</i>-

48
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,192
Oh! Was your mother here?

49
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,989
Here. You all right?
I'll help you up.

50
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,190
Oh, that is quite a basket
you've got there, Michael.

51
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,392
That Sally Sitwell
is one lucky lady.

52
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,232
Well, I'm- I'm not so sure that she's actually...
right for me, anyway.

53
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,138
But you got one of these too, didn't you?
Y-You bought Lindsay at the same auction.

54
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,734
Well, yes, but I'm afraid
I prematurely shot my wad...

55
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,973
on what was supposed to be
a dry run, if you will.

56
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,141
So now I'm afraid I have
something of a mess on my hands.

57
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,152
It's just-There's so many
poorly chosen words in that sentence.

58
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,917
<i>Tobias wanted to make sure</i>
<i>that everything was perfect for Lindsay...</i>

59
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,153
<i>so he went to check it out first.</i>

60
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,661
Oh. Body chocolate.

61
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,033
- It's a wonderful package. I'll take it.
- You just did.

62
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,867
<i>Why don't you take this?</i>
<i>I don't have anyone to go with anyway.</i>

63
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,441
Can you imagine
how jealous that would make her?

64
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,476
"Where's Tobias?"

65
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,139
"Oh, he's just sharing
a romantic horseback ride with Michael Bluth...

66
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,409
and they're dipping each other in"-

67
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:41,419
- Oh, you didn't get any body chocolate.
- L-I didn't mean with me.

68
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,355
L-I hate to see you struggle like this.
In fact, why don't you let me ask her for you?

69
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,019
Well, Michael, you really are
quite the Cupid, aren't you?

70
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,087
I tell you, you can zing your
arrow into my buttocks anytime.

71
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,965
Okay. You know what you do? Buy yourself a
tape recorder. Record yourself for a whole day.

72
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,800
I think you're gonna be surprised
at some of your phrasing.

73
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,807
Butterscotch! Want a lick?

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,345
<i>And later, Lindsay</i>
<i>stopped by the office at Michael's request.</i>

75
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,974
Great. Thank you. Listen. I want you to take...
my romance package at the Four Seas Hotel.

76
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,644
- Oh, yea!
- That's great. Tobias is gonna be thrilled.

77
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,382
- Oh. I have to go with Tobias?
- Lindsay, your husband really wants this to work.

78
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,948
- Come on. Let me play Cupid this year.
- I thought he went already.

79
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,497
- I'm giving you mine.
- Because you're afraid to ask
Sally Sitwell to go with you.

80
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,056
That's not true at all.
- Mmm?
Chaw-chee-chaw, chee-chaw.

81
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,432
- What is that? Is that a chicken?
- What's this?

82
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,971
- Oh. Michael's scared to ask out Sally.
- No, I'm not.

83
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,804
- Chaw-chee-chaw-
- This is priceless.

84
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,402
You too. This is great. Come on.
These aren't even birds.

85
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,074
I am not-That's enough.
There are people working.

86
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,845
Listen, I think that Lucille 2
is up to something.

87
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,684
Mom said the same thing. I thought she was
ticked off'cause you're seeing her.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,315
What? You're seeing Lucille 2?
Does Buster know?

89
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,157
No. And I'm not.
Just don't tell people-

90
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:01,029
I'm playing the part of the gigolo
so that she'll keep the company afloat.

91
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,763
But something weird happened yesterday
when I was trying to find a way out of there.

92
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,808
Hello?

93
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,812
<i>In fact, it was Stan Sitwell calling her...</i>

94
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,781
<i>as he'd become quite taken</i>
<i>with Lucille 2 himself.</i>

95
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,614
It all makes sense.
Why else would Sally Sitwell be avoiding me?

96
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,622
- She thinks you're a loser.
- And why would Lucille 2
be so distant toward me?

97
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,386
- 'Cause she knows you're a loser.
- I think it's pretty clear.

98
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,893
Lucille 2 and Sitwell
are working on a business deal.

99
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,931
Lindsay, I'd like for you to go over
to Sitwell and see what you can find out.

100
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,159
- I can't go there again.
- Why do I have to do that?

101
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,862
Because you've been helping yourself
to the company money for some time.

102
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,461
It's not like you do anything
for the family anyway.

103
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,507
Gob doesn't do anything
for the family.

104
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,042
Hey, I'm-
Lucille 2.

105
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,237
Oh. I could do
something like that.

106
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,748
<i>This is what Dad was really good at</i>-
<i>getting us out of tight spots.</i>

107
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,184
<i>In fact, at that very moment,</i>
<i>George Sr.</i> was <i>in a tight spot...</i>

108
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,916
<i>as he'd gotten himself</i>
<i>wedged under the furnace...</i>

109
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,619
<i>while chasing after a sour ball</i>
<i>that had rolled out ofhis pocket.</i>

110
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,599
<i>Eventually, Michael rescued him.</i>

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,827
<i>I'm starting to worry</i>
<i>she's gonna sell us out.</i>

112
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,269
I think the answer
to this problem is money.

113
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,605
Now, this may just be me having my head against
a hundred-degree furnace for an hour...

114
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,235
but maybe we should
bring in Jack Dorso.

115
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,908
- UncleJack?
- Well, no. He's not my uncle.
He's, uh, my dad's friend.

116
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,281
But, uh, this guy
has got a fortune.

117
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,379
<i>Jack Dorso</i>
<i>first achieved success in the '40s...</i>

118
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,392
<i>as a costar of the radio and then film serial,</i>
- Nazi Hunters.

119
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,395
<i>There are two Nazis</i>
<i>up there in that dance hall.</i>

120
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,431
<i>Shoot me.</i>

121
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,057
Happy Valentine's Day, Nazis.

122
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,762
<i>When the actor</i>
<i>who played Red McGibbon...</i>

123
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,669
<i>was jailed for his</i>
<i>Communist sympathies...</i>

124
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,574
<i>Jack Dorso made one attempt</i>
<i>at a solo Bullet feature.</i>

125
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,909
<i>But the audience was not ready</i>
<i>to accept Bullet as a romantic lead...</i>

126
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,882
<i>despite his powerful upper body.</i>

127
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,885
<i>So he started</i>
<i>a chain of gymnasiums...</i>

128
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,718
<i>having stolen the idea</i>
<i>from Red during a prison visit.</i>

129
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,349
<i>- And as the years passed-</i>
<i>- Hey, Jack!</i>

130
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,920
<i>He became well-known</i>
<i>for his annual birthday feats of strength.</i>

131
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,057
Five pounds for each year of my life.

132
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,228
<i>Sadly, he lost the use</i>
<i>ofhis legs on his 70th birthday</i>-

133
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,740
- Release!
- <i>at the newly-remodeled Jack Dorso's</i>
<i>in Albany, New York.</i>

134
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,606
Too much!

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,108
If he's got so much money,
how come we never called him before?

136
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,878
But I have. I mean, there wouldn't be
a Bluth Company without him.

137
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,317
I could never have afforded
that first tract of land.

138
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,321
But he always wants
something in return.

139
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,323
I don't know.

140
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,259
See if you can talk your mother into
taking another bullet for the Bluth family.

141
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:53,328
<i>The family gathered at Lucille's</i>
<i>to welcome and solicit UncleJack.</i>

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,430
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>he wasn't really their uncle.</i>

143
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,341
Buster. Nice of you to take a break
from that common whore you've been dating.

144
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:03,973
She is not a whore, Mother. She happens to
be the new secretary of the Bluth Company.

145
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,645
<i>And, yes, she's more</i> experienced
<i>than a normal girl.</i>

146
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:13,282
- But sometimes love <i>should</i> be terrifying.
- <i>In fact...</i>

147
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,327
<i>Buster had even started</i>
<i>using his army stealth training.</i>
- <i>Buster.</i>

148
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,024
I'll be right in, and then
maybe we can talk about-

149
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,260
Makin' that love.

150
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:31,475
<i>I shouldn't complain. It's better than</i>
<i>you dating Lucille 2, that</i> bitch!

151
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,809
<i>Lucille 2's not a "B,"Mother.</i>
<i>She's kind, and she's caring...</i>

152
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,817
and she's certainly less experienced
than that <i>whore</i> that I'm dating now.

153
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,285
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>screaming it out loud...</i>

154
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,481
<i>that made Buster realize</i>
<i>that he missed Lucille 2.</i>

155
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,889
<i>I'm wondering if you can keep</i>
<i>some of the more piercing profanities down...</i>

156
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,894
when the 90-year-old
fitness buff gets here?

157
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,726
You know, Michael, I was happy
to call UncleJack for you...

158
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,164
but that's as much
as I'm going to do.

159
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,168
If you know what I mean.

160
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,738
I need a more vital man.

161
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,967
<i>Someone order 140 pounds</i>
<i>of upper-body strength?</i>

162
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,203
Well, he certainly
sounds vital to me.

163
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,780
<i>Walk, Dragon! Walk!</i>

164
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,349
- Enter the room!
- <i>Welcome, UncleJack.</i>

165
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,477
He's half deaf.
It was a stupid, stupid hire.

166
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,251
Not "higher."
Eye level! Eye level!

167
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,225
Kisses, and then we talk.
Which one is Michael?

168
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,523
- Uh-
- Swoop me!

169
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,429
<i>Oh.</i>
- <i>I, uh, really appreciate</i>
<i>you coming over, UncleJack.</i>

170
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,265
Thank you for having me.
You may be amazed.

171
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,102
Uh, I'm invited into
very few personal homes.

172
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,108
To the nuts!

173
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,378
The bridge mix!
The bridge mix! Fool!

174
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,548
Hey, fake UncleJack.

175
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,951
Is this the boy? Is this the little one?
My God, you're an army man.

176
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,355
- Well-
- I was never in the army. I was in the pictures.

177
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,257
Here comes UncleJack. Shoot me!

178
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,922
Oh, God!

179
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,762
Look at that. I pinned him. I pinned the army man.

180
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:07,271
God bless you for being in the army.
Up, Dragon!

181
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:12,743
Lift. Lift with vigor.

182
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:17,339
- Remember me?
- <i>Lucille. You look younger</i>
<i>than you did the day l</i>-

183
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,284
Oh, you old fool. I'm Lucille.

184
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:26,188
You look fabulous.
Back to the blonde. Back to the blonde.

185
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,521
Isn't she beautiful? Oh, yeah.

186
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,423
He's kind of scary, that guy, huh?

187
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,933
Not to me.
I think he's kind of cool.

188
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,664
Well, why don't you go get your kiss
from Mr. Cool Half-Man?

189
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,672
- I'd be fine with that.
- Let's go.

190
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,605
- So what's your point?
- Come on.

191
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,973
Why, she's no bigger
than one of my legs.

192
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,876
Shake them for her.

193
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,108
Excuse me, UncleJack.
I'm George Michael.

194
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,708
It's okay. Just ignore it!

195
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,448
Ignore it. Just something the body does
when you're shaken.

196
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,353
<i>Don't shake it!</i>
<i>Don't shake it!</i>

197
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,358
- Towel!
- Not the good ones!

198
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,361
Is he dying? What if he's dying?

199
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,359
Boy, that Dragon's cute, huh?

200
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,526
What, the deaf giant
who's holding our fake uncle?

201
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,831
He's been flirting
with me all night.

202
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,498
I was thinking maybe it would
be best for the family...

203
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,203
if I went on that romance thing
with Drag instead ofTobias...

204
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,245
which would <i>be</i> a drag.

205
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,510
Yeah, that's just the kind of joke Drag can't hear.

206
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,883
No, you're gonna go with Tobias or not at all.
Now tell me what you found out at Sitwell.

207
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,388
- Oh. You still want me to do that?
- You didn't?

208
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,721
Lindsay, I give you one thing to do
for the business, and you can't even do it.

209
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,819
I mean, if you'd tried and failed,
I'd understand, but you didn't even try.

210
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,730
So, I didn't even fail, and I don't see you
giving me credit for that.

211
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,497
<i>Michael knew</i>
<i>that since Lindsay let him down...</i>

212
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:51,270
<i>he had no choice but to ask UncleJack</i>
<i>for the money to save his company.</i>

213
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,971
- Pretty.
- Yes.

214
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,210
Do you think you should be perched
on the edge of the building like this?

215
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,751
Oh, Dragon's got me.

216
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,317
- Dragon's in the bathroom.
- Mama!

217
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,019
Come on. I got ya. I got ya. It's okay.

218
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,859
<i>And so Michael laid out his dilemma.</i>
...family company get ruined.

219
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:17,800
- I was hoping that this was a social visit-
- Well-

220
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,431
particularly when that sister of yours
started giving me the cutie eye.

221
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,236
She did?

222
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:29,508
Unfortunately that moose was holding me,
so I couldn't make my move.

223
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,211
Of course I couldn't make that move
without that moose, but that's my challenge.

224
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,982
I won't go wheelchair!

225
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,057
Twirl me around.

226
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,121
Hey, hey. No.
I got you. I got you.

227
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,289
You all right?

228
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,357
But Valentine's Day is here,
and I'm alone.

229
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,403
The moose is no one.

230
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,168
Perhaps if I had
a little... companionship...

231
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,211
I'd be a little more
disposed to whip out...

232
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,076
that old wallet of mine.

233
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,810
You're saying if I were
to set you up with my sister...

234
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,410
- you would consider bailing us out?
- Oh, joy. Yeah.

235
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,422
<i>Michael was torn.</i>

236
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,459
- <i>The business meant the world</i>
<i>to him, but his sister's honor</i>-
- Let's do it.

237
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,256
- <i>uh, meant a lot too.</i>
- Let's go share the good news.

238
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,300
<i>Michael had offered his sister</i>
<i>to his UncleJack...</i>

239
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,805
<i>in exchange for money</i>
<i>to save the company.</i>

240
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,308
<i>Remember, it's not their real uncle.</i>

241
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,346
- He's cute, isn't he?
- So cute.

242
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,780
- Imagine him without that muscly
little old guy in his arms.
- Oh, Dragon. Right.

243
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:43,116
Well, that's why I was thinking maybe you
should go with Dragon on that romantic getaway.

244
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,622
- Oh.
- Now, I know he's working...

245
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,954
so UncleJack's
gonna have to go along.

246
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,688
Oh. Well, as long as
he promises not to shake him.

247
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,787
- Mmm.
- So, what did he say about the money?

248
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,334
He said he'd like to sleep on it.

249
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,496
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Buster had decided to pursue a new girlfriend:</i>

250
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,506
<i>His old girlfriend.</i>

251
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,974
Hey- Brother?
What are you doing here?

252
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,739
I'm keeping an eye on the woman
who controls our company.

253
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,815
In her robe and slippies?

254
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,545
Getting into her head. I think she's planning
on selling our company to Stan Sitwell.

255
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,487
But I've lost her trail, and I don't think
I have the skills to pick it up.

256
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,219
Skills?

257
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,097
These kind of skills?

258
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,827
Not really.

259
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:34,031
But if you give me one of those outfits,
we can hide in the bushes and spy on them.

260
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,404
I would like to see her again.
You've got it.

261
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,276
<i>And Michael told his father</i>
<i>the good news about UncleJack.</i>

262
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,577
- You are pimping out your sister?
- You were pimping out my mother.

263
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,085
Yes, because she was
sleeping with my brother, but your sister?

264
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,850
Everything's gonna be fine.
No one's gonna get hurt.

265
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,118
No one is going to get hurt.

266
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,390
<i>Oh. Hey, Michael. My dad wanted me</i>
<i>to thank you for the romantic getaway.</i>

267
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,522
Don't tell me what that means.

268
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,693
- Where is your dad?
- He left, dressed all western-y.

269
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,702
You could leave me
out of that part too.

270
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,035
<i>And Michael realized</i>
<i>that perhaps somebody would get hurt.</i>

271
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,237
- I just screwed my brother-in-law.
- Well, I'm all grown up now.

272
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,905
<i>So Michael rushed</i>
<i>to the Four Seas Hotel...</i>

273
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,143
<i>to keep Tobias from finding out</i>
<i>about Lindsay's date.</i>

274
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,379
Michael, this is Jeff.
He does all the horse work here.

275
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,286
You'll meet him again at the end.
Plus, he gets you your juice.

276
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,155
Not your first juice,
but the one you get at the spa.

277
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,718
- That's right. You've done this before.
- But not with a lovely lady.

278
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,062
Jeff doubts one's coming at all,
don't you? Sorry. Sorry.

279
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,602
About the lovely lady-

280
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,534
Stop. You dropped the boot.
Dropped the boot.

281
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,906
<i>Michael came up with</i>
<i>the only evasion he could think of.</i>

282
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,039
<i>Tobias, the lovely lady, she's gonna be</i>
<i>a little bit late. She's doing some work.</i>

283
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,050
She said to get started without her.

284
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,588
- Saddle me up, Jeff.
- It's gonna take a few minutes
to tack another horse.

285
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,854
<i>So Michael embarked on</i>
<i>the romantic adventure he'd spent so lavishly for.</i>

286
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,692
Well, you certainly didn't help
with my reputation as a lady's man with Jeff.

287
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,528
But we'll clear all that up in the spa
when I get my <i>facial.</i>

288
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,034
Hey, did you ever get
that tape recorder?

289
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,232
You're funny.
Come on, boy. Hoo-cha-cha!

290
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:19,004
<i>Soon the next group</i>
<i>began their romantic date.</i>

291
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,807
- So nice of you to cover this, UncleJack.
- My pleasure.

292
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,109
It's nice to do something
you don't need legs for.

293
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,383
Towel!

294
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,984
<i>And Lucille 2</i>
<i>showed up with Stan Sitwell...</i>

295
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,656
<i>who did look a little</i>
<i>like Edgar Winter.</i>

296
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:45,670
<i>And one by one, they each enjoyed</i>
<i>the activities of their romantic getaways.</i>

297
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,035
- Body chocolate?
- No.

298
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,131
<i>Of course, in the spa...</i>

299
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:55,202
<i>thejets proved too powerful</i>
<i>for UncleJack's tiny legs.</i>

300
00:16:55,314 --> 00:17:00,217
<i>The spa portion also proved challenging</i>
<i>to Stan Sitwell and Lucille 2...</i>

301
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,083
<i>who in turn</i>
<i>were being followed by Buster...</i>

302
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,049
<i>and Gob.</i>

303
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,188
<i>And soon, Michael and Tobias</i>
<i>awaited their massage therapists.</i>

304
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,355
So, uh, Tobias...

305
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,663
I'm afraid that your wife
might not actually end up here with you.

306
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,501
You know, Michael, perhaps
I should buy <i>you</i> that tape recorder.

307
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,405
Do you have any idea how often
you say the word "afraid"?

308
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,501
Well, I know I used it
in theJacuzzi.

309
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,547
And I apologize for that.
I thought it was a pool toy.

310
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,412
<i>But you were supposed</i>
<i>to be here with Sally Sitwell...</i>

311
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,248
but... you were afraid
to ask her.

312
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,188
So what do you do? You create issues,
and you make up imaginary problems...

313
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,419
like this merger
I hear you're worried about.

314
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,723
Well, uh, you're probably right-

315
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,459
About me being afraid of the word "No," but-

316
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,001
You know, the merger's real.
I'm not imagining that.

317
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,537
Lucille! Michael.

318
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,039
- Michael?
- What are you doing here?

319
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,871
Following Lucille 2.
She's with Sitwell.

320
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,411
She probably figured
that we'd never track her.

321
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,914
But we lost her.
Everyone put on white robes and outsmarted us.

322
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,952
Lucille! Lindsay?

323
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,715
Lindsay.

324
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,883
Wait, wait, wait.
Lindsay's here? With two men?

325
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,892
Sort of one and a half.

326
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,462
Tobias. Hey, Tobias!

327
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,766
Lindsay, look. L- Oh.
Lucille 2. I'm sorry.

328
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,836
- And, miss, I don't know your name.
- <i>Tobias?</i>

329
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,235
Lucille? Sitwell? What's this?

330
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,307
It's our romantic getaway, Michael.

331
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,571
Romantic? So, then the company
isn't being taken over...

332
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,306
so Lindsay doesn't have
to be with UncleJack?

333
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,850
Oh, Tobias.
We gotta stop Linds-Tobias?

334
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,182
- How'd you like to take a nap, baldy?
- I'll handle this.

335
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,279
She's my girlfriend, pal.
Take him down, Buster.

336
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,689
Your girlfriend? That's why
you were in her robe and slippies.

337
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,887
You weren't trying
to get into her head.

338
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,022
You were trying to get into her...
robe and slippies.

339
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,693
She's my girlfriend!

340
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,533
So this is
who you choose over me?

341
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,441
She's not with him.
She's with the Bullet.

342
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,479
Oh, thank God.

343
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,983
But if you want a fight,
you got it. Shoot me!

344
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,556
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

345
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,095
Look, I wasn't trying
to sell your company, but I am now.

346
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,858
The hell with all of you.

347
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,024
I'm gonna try and lowball her.

348
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,865
- Not while we're around.
- We're not done here, Gob!

349
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,070
<i>Tobias? Tobias, I'm sorry.</i>

350
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,804
I set this up for Lindsay.
Lindsay, I'm sorry.

351
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,847
- You were not on a date with Dragon.
- I know that, Michael.

352
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,145
It was pretty obvious when Dragon
kept swooping UncleJack in for a kiss.

353
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,550
<i>You said I never did anything</i>
<i>for the company. L-I just thought I'd try.</i>

354
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:54,149
<i>Tobias, I never thought</i>
<i>you'd ever fight for me.</i>

355
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,662
I had no idea a 90-year-old man
could cave in my chest cavity like that.

356
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,995
Dragon, would you mind
carrying my husband to the car?

357
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,969
Oh, God.

358
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,634
<i>I love takin' a guy down!</i>

359
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,211
I think I snapped one of his ribs.

360
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,838
<i>No. It's my leg.</i>

361
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,349
I'll bet that would hurt.

362
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,420
I guess the deal's off now,
now that I actually need you to help us out?

363
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,718
<i>I'll make you a deal.</i>
<i>You carry me, and I'll carry you.</i>

364
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,190
Thanks, UncleJack.

365
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,421
- Yeah. I think we should get to the hospital.
- Let me see.

366
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,863
I think this duct tape is the only thing
that's keeping the ankle on.

367
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,802
Okay. Ah. Right around there.
Oh. I think you're right inside me now.

368
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,532
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

369
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,767
<i>UncleJack buys the company...</i>

370
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,809
<i>but makes some changes ofhis own.</i>

371
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,937
And he's gonna make me president.

372
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,677
<i>Tobias listens to</i>
<i>a day's worth ofhis own words...</i>

373
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,413
<i>to see what Michael was referring to.</i>

374
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,684
Even if it means
me taking a chubby, I will suck it up.

375
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,283
Nothing wrong with that.
I've been in the film business for a while...

376
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,590
but I just can't seem
to get one in the can.

377
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,722
It's out of context.

378
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,428
<i>I wouldn't mind kissing</i>
<i>that man between the cheeks, so to speak.</i>

379
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,994
<i>And he realizes there</i> is
<i>something distinct about the way he speaks.</i>

380
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,338
Tobias, you blowhard!

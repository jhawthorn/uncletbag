1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,233
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,499
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,878
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,053
<i>Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell.</i>

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,182
I still can't believe we got in.
This place is usually so packed on Sundays.

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,988
<i>In addition to its Sunday popularity...</i>

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,895
<i>the bistro was also famous</i>
<i>for something called the Skip's Scramble</i>-

9
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,365
<i>an egg dish that contained</i>
<i>everything on the menu.</i>

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,936
<i>Don't order the Skip's Scramble.</i>

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,940
<i>Just more good luck. Everything's been</i>
<i>going so well since we started goin'out.</i>

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,442
I think we've actually
gone out eight times now.

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,535
<i>Which included a record-tying...</i>

14
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,046
<i>three lovemaking sessions</i>
<i>in one night for Michael.</i>

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,049
- Yes!
- <i>Just think...</i>

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,814
how different everything in our lives would be
if we'd gotten together in high school.

17
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,151
Of course, I wouldn't
have had George Michael.

18
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,091
We probably would've had
an entirely different kind of child.

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,559
I really hope
he's okay with us goin' out.

20
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,930
We're very close.
We don't keep anything from each other.

21
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,902
Oh, no, it's my Dad.
I'm supposed to be at work.

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,599
You know, George Michael,
you worry too much.

23
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,234
It's Sunday. You're allowed to
have a couple of hours off.

24
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,609
You don't see me nervous
about being on my third Virgin Mary.

25
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,182
Why would you be nervous?
There's no alcohol in a Virgin Mary.

26
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,014
There isn't?
This is unbelievable.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,111
Can I get a virgin piña colada
when you get a chance?

28
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,190
Now we'll get
things started.

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,192
<i>Hi. This is so, uh</i>-
<i>I was just</i>-

30
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,285
Hey, okay.

31
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,489
I want to introduce you to Sally.
This is George Michael.

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,089
- <i>My niece, Maeby.</i>
- It's nice to meet you.

33
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,601
I just shut down the banana stand
for a half an hour.

34
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,103
- I can keep it open late tonight if you-
- No. Hey. Come on.

35
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,697
Make me sound like a taskmaster.

36
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,039
But if- if you want to keep it open
an extra hour, you know.

37
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,443
<i>So, this is Sally.</i>

38
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,015
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,608
- Yes!
- A little.

40
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,813
<i>You know what? I'm gonna meet</i>
<i>you in a few minutes, okay?</i>

41
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,550
- Okay.
- And maybe we'll work on
breaking that record, huh?

42
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,218
Okay.

43
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,626
She's a shot-putter.
And I'm dating her.

44
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,528
<i>But I just want to make sure</i>
<i>that you're comfortable with everything.</i>

45
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,125
<i>Well, of course. We could double-date.</i>
<i>You and Sally and me and Ann.</i>

46
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,637
- Who?
- W-Ann.

47
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,468
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah, we had-

48
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,236
Of course I know Ann.
Yeah, see, I didn't mean "who."

49
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,643
I meant, uh, "her."
That's a great idea.

50
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,238
- I love Ann.
- <i>Great.</i>

51
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,581
Excuse me, ma'am.

52
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,847
<i>George Michael, you said that</i>
<i>you couldn't come to church...</i>

53
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,048
because you were working,
and now you're doing neither?

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,093
That's quite a lot of sins
for a Sunday afternoon, don't you think?

55
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,526
- Your virgin piña colada.
- And now you're drinking?

56
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,996
No. We're just having
a little fun, you know.

57
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,930
I think the church
and studying are fun.

58
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,025
- I thought you felt the same.
- Well, I do.

59
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,036
L- I like not having fun.

60
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,038
I like your idea
of fun, I mean.

61
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,007
Our idea of fun.
I like not having that.

62
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,072
I'm going
back to church.

63
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,843
Well, she just
killed my buzz.

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,680
So, you're still
enjoying this relationship?

65
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,414
I mean, I guess we've lost some of the heat
since we have kissed.

66
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,683
<i>I mean, how do you</i>
<i>relight that fire?</i>

67
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,419
But I can't break up with her. I always assumed
she would break up with me.

68
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,258
Well, we may have to find
a way to speed that process up.

69
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,026
<i>And later that day,</i>
<i>Michael caught Lindsay up...</i>

70
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,729
<i>on the emotional bond</i>
<i>he was forming with Sally.</i>

71
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,965
Oh, big deal, three times.
I've had three times plenty of times.

72
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,065
Yes!

73
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,973
Did you call my name?

74
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,103
Absolutely not.

75
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,273
I just hope that George Michael
is really okay with it.

76
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,579
I think you're looking
for a reason this isn't going to work...

77
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,883
because you can't handle happiness,
and you like to suffer.

78
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,982
<i>Oh, how delicious!</i>

79
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,584
Oh, hey, let's not spin
in the comfy chair.

80
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,154
Look at this delicious piece of irony.
I'm being sued for divorce.

81
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,393
- Me.
- Thought you were single?

82
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,128
Yeah, I keep forgetting
that I got married.

83
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,604
<i>Gob met a woman one night.</i>

84
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,165
<i>And after a series of</i>
<i>escalating dares, married her.</i>

85
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,074
Yes, but it's all
coming back to me now.

86
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,806
<i>She was a seal dealer.</i>

87
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,975
She raised and sold seals to aquariums
and marine parks, that sort of thing.

88
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,646
Then she went off to fight her war
and left me to look after them.

89
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,485
<i>It was while in the service</i>
<i>that her penchant for daring...</i>

90
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,559
<i>found a natural outlet.</i>

91
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,862
I've never known you
to look after a seal.

92
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,659
Turns out it's a major hassle.
Tried to include one in my act once.

93
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,633
There's a reason you don't typically
see live seals in a magic show.

94
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,000
So with a simple wave of my-

95
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,935
Oh, look-it over... there.

96
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,533
Well, one of the "Desperate Housewives,"
looking so desperate.

97
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,910
So I released them from whence they came,
and now she's stomping on my heart.

98
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,985
- What's her first name? Quickly.
- Krindy.

99
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,315
Name's not Krindy, Gob.

100
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,050
Ah, Saul Zentsman.
No, that's her lawyer.

101
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,025
Well, she's got a name.
And I'm gonna find out what it is...

102
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,564
and then I'm gonna make a pun on it,
and that's what I'll call her.

103
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,792
Bad example- if her name's Amy,
I'll call her Blamy.

104
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,891
That's a strong defense.
I'll tell you what.

105
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,493
I'll help you look for Barry tomorrow.
I think Dad prepaid him...

106
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,835
for Lindsay and Tobias's
divorce anyway.

107
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,307
Look at us. Three relationships,
all falling apart.

108
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,608
Maybe it's time we actually
took some responsibility for that.

109
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,547
- I think it's Mom's fault.
- I was gonna say the exact same thing.

110
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,210
No, that's not a spinner.

111
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,222
<i>So this is how my children</i>
<i>speak of me when I'm not here.</i>

112
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,417
- What are you doin' here, Mom?
- <i>Your brother Buster...</i>

113
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,494
wants to meet me
at the beach tomorrow.

114
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,086
Do you know what this is about?
Because if it's about going in the ocean...

115
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,598
the answer is
no, he's not going in the ocean.

116
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,965
Well, there are
bigger dangers, Mom.

117
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,335
Like, say, signing him up
for the army during wartime.

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,499
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

119
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,008
Michael Moore confronted me
in front of the whole country.

120
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,671
First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore.
It was a look-alike.

121
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,873
And it wasn't in front
of the whole country.

122
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,916
It was for a bit
on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live.</i>

123
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,418
I don't know who that is,
and I don't care to find out.

124
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,081
<i>But the next day,</i>
<i>she did find out what Buster wanted.</i>

125
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,785
Okay, I think we have enough
of you two kissing.

126
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,862
Oh, I can't believe
you hired a photographer.

127
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,023
<i>We haven't done this since</i>
<i>the</i> Balboa Bay Window <i>magazine.</i>

128
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,362
So, I wanted you to have
a recent picture of me...

129
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,407
because they want to ship me
out tomorrow with army.

130
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,874
What?
To where?

131
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,707
Iraq. And I just
might be out of options.

132
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,713
I don't want to go,
but they keep-

133
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,545
I know what this is about.
You want to go swimming in the ocean.

134
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,551
Well, you can forget it.

135
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,644
- I don't think that's what this is about.
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

136
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,917
He's trying to punish me
or something.

137
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,516
- Whatever happened to "Keepin' It Fresh"?
- I was 30 years old then, Mother.

138
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,995
I'm 32 now! And I'm not
trying to teach you a lesson.

139
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,998
Well, I may not have
been a perfect mother.

140
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,965
But, you know,
kids don't come with a handbook.

141
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,505
<i>In fact, there are</i>
<i>thousands ofbooks written on child-rearing.</i>

142
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,006
<i>But Lucille was in denial.</i>

143
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,099
If he wants to
go swimming, let him.

144
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,044
<i>And Buster was far from ready</i>
<i>to go swimming in the ocean.</i>

145
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,452
<i>And later, Michael and Gob</i>
<i>tracked down their attorney...</i>

146
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,886
- <i>Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>
- Thank you so much for coming down here.

147
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,118
I've got a big case.
I'm representing Skip Church's restaurant.

148
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,956
- I don't care.
- A waitress that works there is claiming...

149
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,589
that by eating Skip's Scramble
several times a week is making her a fatty.

150
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,997
<i>We need to speak to you</i>
<i>about getting a divorce for Gob.</i>

151
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,333
- Oh, well, I got Michael
out of his marriage, didn't I?
- Actually, she died.

152
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,603
- You're kidding. I've been
taking credit for that for years.
- Credit?

153
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,939
- Who's their lawyer?
- Saul Zentsman. Do you know him?

154
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,037
I have Chinese with him every
Friday night at Miss Temple's.

155
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,981
- He's tough.
- I just want my wife back.

156
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,813
Save it for the stand,
okay, Tom Jane?

157
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,356
Fine. I'll get into this
as soon as I lose this case.

158
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,221
You know who's defending
the fatty? Maggie Lizer.

159
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,556
Maggie Lizer,
our old prosecutor?

160
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,960
<i>Michael had an affair</i>
<i>with Maggie Lizer...</i>

161
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,227
<i>while she was both pretending to be blind</i>
<i>and prosecuting the family.</i>

162
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,531
<i>It was with her he'd first set</i>
<i>the three-time record.</i>

163
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,605
Yes!

164
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,300
<i>Their relationship</i>
<i>ended somewhat abruptly.</i>

165
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,178
- Wow. How does she look?
- Well, she's get-

166
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,180
If you ask me, bigger.

167
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,012
- <i>She was bigger</i>-
- Are you sure you're okay to go on?

168
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,018
<i>Because she was pregnant.</i>

169
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,214
It's not my belly we have to
worry about, Your Honor.

170
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,485
It's Loretta's.

171
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:19,498
<i>Being tempted day in and day out</i>
<i>by those Skip's Scrambles.</i>

172
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,330
Bring 'em in, boys.

173
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,337
<i>Oh, I'm cooked. They love her.</i>

174
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,669
Tell you the truth,
I preferred it when she was blind.

175
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,971
<i>And so, Michael caught up</i>
<i>with his onetime lover.</i>

176
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,241
How you doin'?
Wow, you look... fantastic.

177
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,749
Wow. Haven't seen you since we had
an affair and you ruined my career.

178
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,945
Yeah, I was gonna call you
a couple of times, and then I just-

179
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,046
I got to thinking, uh,
"What if she brings that up?"

180
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,423
To tell you the truth, I am so relieved
not to be pretending to be blind anymore.

181
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,466
It's actually taught me not to rely
on cheap tricks to get the jury's sympathy.

182
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,694
<i>I'm sorry. I know I'm not</i>
<i>supposed to do this...</i>

183
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,793
but we just spend
so much time in that box.

184
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,136
- I knitted you something.
- Oh, Juror Number Four!

185
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:06,541
Gosh, thank you. I feel so bad
I fought so hard to keep you off the jury.

186
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,773
- Oh-
- Ms. Lizer, can I see you in my chambers?

187
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,213
Oh. Yes, Your Honor.

188
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,753
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>Judge Ping had a gift for Maggie too-</i>

189
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:19,052
<i>an Ocean-Sounds Toddler Rocker</i>
<i>he'd asked his bailiff to assemble.</i>

190
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,888
Too bad the trial's not going longer.
She could've knit you something that fit.

191
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,155
I know.
I'm so big now.

192
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,322
No, no, come on.
They look great.

193
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,899
You look great.
You look fantastic.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560
Last time I saw you was in
that jury box right there, wasn't it?

195
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,763
- Wasn't it like a year ago?
- Oh, Chip, you know what?

196
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,272
Can you take this
back to my house?

197
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,578
Actually, it's been about
eight and a half months.

198
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,580
Eight and a half
months, huh? Wow.

199
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,775
I see somebody has
been counting the, uh-

200
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,319
Eight and a half months. Wow. Really?
Could've sworn it was a year.

201
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,824
<i>Michael hadjust learned...</i>

202
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,658
<i>that the woman he'd been intimate</i>
<i>with eight and a half months earlier...</i>

203
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,595
<i>was eight-and-a-half</i>
<i>months pregnant.</i>

204
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,861
- Didn't I use something?
- No.

205
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,132
You thought
I was blind, remember?

206
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,036
Don't worry. You're not the father, Michael.

207
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,301
- No problem.
- Really?

208
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,808
- Right.
- You sure? I mean, uh-

209
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,176
<i>I could be. What if I was?</i>
<i>Don't you want to discuss this maybe?</i>

210
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,408
Michael, I haven't
heard from you.

211
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,507
L- I really don't want
to hear from you now.

212
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,179
Listen, if you're interested,
come to the baptism.

213
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,552
You can hurl a Bible
at the baby.

214
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,058
<i>And that night,</i>
<i>Michael met up with Sally...</i>

215
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,129
<i>where he felt he needed</i>
<i>to be honest with her.</i>

216
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,130
Sally...

217
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,166
you need to know
about my child.

218
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,167
George Michael.
He approves.

219
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,965
No, there may be
another child in the mix.

220
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:44,509
I ran into an ex.
We had a very messed up relationship.

221
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,477
It was based totally on lies.
But she's pregnant.

222
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,549
She said something that led me
to believe that it might be mine.

223
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,108
- But you said she was a liar.
- Sh-She is.

224
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,415
She said it
wasn't mine, so-

225
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,581
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, because obviously...

226
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,057
if it is my child, I'm gonna
have to be responsible for it...

227
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,424
and that's going to make things
awfully complicated for us.

228
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,760
Michael, you know what? You're always
looking for things to get between us.

229
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,766
First, it was
"What's your son gonna think?"

230
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,768
And now you think
you're having a baby...

231
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,065
because a woman who lies
told you you weren't.

232
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,335
That's a great way to say that. We really do
communicate well, do you know that?

233
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,475
<i>Are you insane?</i>
<i>You broke up with her because...</i>

234
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,877
somebody who doesn't want you
might be pregnant with your baby?

235
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,213
No, Sally broke up with me.
And as for Maggie...

236
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,684
I didn't even know that
she was pregnant when I first saw her.

237
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,779
All I could see was
her giant chest- box.

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,757
She had this- Some people
call it a chest. I call it a box.

239
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,760
She was holding this giant box.
Maybe I should've just stayed out of it.

240
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,490
She did make it pretty clear
that she doesn't want me around.

241
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,226
Come on, Michael.
She's probably not even pregnant.

242
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,427
You said she was
carrying a big box?

243
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,437
Pregnant women
tend not to do that.

244
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,700
It did say "60 pounds" on it.

245
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,902
Okay, l-I've done
this wrong.

246
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,378
I should've found out whether it was a real
pregnancy before I told my dream girl about it.

247
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,608
<i>You know what I do, Mike?</i>
<i>Check their urine.</i>

248
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,084
Make 'em pee in a cup,
and pee in a cup right in front of me.

249
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,384
Yeah, well, thanks, Gob. But, uh, I think
we should just keep on lookin'.

250
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,481
<i>I don't know how I can</i>
<i>make that sound like me.</i>

251
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,823
So you get someone to break
into her house, rig the toilet...

252
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,898
collect the pee, test it,
and expose the lie.

253
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,558
I mean, I'd do it, but I'm goin'
through a divorce here, guy.

254
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,432
Oh, a pregnancy test.

255
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,233
There's something we never had,
huh, Lindsay? Oh, no.

256
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,173
We had to create our
little Frankenstein monster...

257
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,336
out of science and money
and just a dash of-

258
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,108
Maeby, what- H-How long
have you been standing there?

259
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,844
- I just walked in.
- Just walked in.

260
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,945
Seems like only yesterday you were
bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb.

261
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,856
<i>You know what? Tobias and I will</i>
<i>break into her house and get the specimen.</i>

262
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,588
- We've been looking for a little excitement.
<i>- Yeah!</i>

263
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,291
It'll be fun. We will be like Tracy and Hepburn.

264
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,665
- "What do you say, you old poop?"
- Oh, God, he's Hepburn.

265
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,830
I am done with Buster.

266
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,998
He pushes my buttons.
That's all he does.

267
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,167
He also zips you up
and sands your elbows.

268
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,713
Not anymore. No, no, no.
He's pretending he's going to war.

269
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,214
Mr. Big Shot. God knows
what he's really doing.

270
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,217
Wait a minute. He said he's
going to war? Aren't you worried?

271
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,219
Oh, you're sounding
like your uncle.

272
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,983
And I've had enough
of his attitude too.

273
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,618
- The boy is going to war.
You're gonna have to face that.
- It's none of your business!

274
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,628
He is my boy!

275
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,857
- I need macaroons.
- Oh, you're high!

276
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,731
Oh, well, you can win every argument like that,
but that does not make you right.

277
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,704
I don't want you telling him
you're his father! I need ice!

278
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,832
Can't you see you're in denial?

279
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,410
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

280
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,071
- Where did Buster say he was going?
- Iraq.

281
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,241
Which is a shot at your father.
Thank God he's not here to hear this.

282
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,547
Excuse me one second.

283
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,088
- <i>It's the pipes.</i>
- <i>You know, Mother Lucille...</i>

284
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,988
there's a psychological
concept...

285
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,560
known as denial that I
believe you're evincing.

286
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,722
It's when a thought
is so hateful...

287
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,562
that the mind
literally rejects it.

288
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,627
You are a worse psychiatrist
than you are a son-in-law...

289
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,899
and you will never
get work as an actor...

290
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,237
because you have no talent.

291
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,744
Well, if she's not going to say anything,
I certainly can't help her.

292
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,283
<i>And Maeby</i>
<i>saw a way to help her cousin.</i>

293
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,750
I know how to get rid of Ann.
You put her in a room with Gangy.

294
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,551
- She'll criticize her away.
- But what would Gangy
have to criticize about Ann?

295
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,182
Oh, George Michael-

296
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,454
<i>In the attic,</i>
<i>Michael met with George Sr...</i>

297
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,362
- <i>who'd overheard about Buster.</i>
- He can't go. You can't let him.

298
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,366
I command you.

299
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,527
I really hate it when
you put on the God costume.

300
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,764
<i>George Sr.</i>
<i>Had always worn the God costume...</i>

301
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,433
<i>at the annual</i>
<i>Living Classics Pageant...</i>

302
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,206
<i>where he and Buster re-created</i>
<i>Michelangelo's</i> The Creation of Adam.

303
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,773
What if I never get a chance to reach out
and touch that hand of his again?

304
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,149
- I gotta go to him.
- Pop, you're a wanted man.

305
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,586
You cannot risk leaving
the attic all the time.

306
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,919
Oh, when? When have I
ever left the attic?

307
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,222
Two days ago. Right? Saw you
floating around the Ford dealership.

308
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,796
Yeah, well, have you seen
the new Ford Mustang?

309
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,798
You could hump that hood.

310
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,596
<i>And Michael</i>
<i>set the plan in motion to get...</i>

311
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,102
- <i>Maggie out ofher house.</i>
- Hi, Maggie.

312
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,571
- Are you blind again?
- For the pizza guy.

313
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,142
I give him a five.
I tell him to keep the change.

314
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,507
What are you doin' here,
Michael? I'm with a client.

315
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,375
- Is that the pizza?
- No!

316
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,244
You'll get your pizza.

317
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,477
She's taking the stand tomorrow.
I want to make sure it creaks.

318
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,645
There's so much I don't
understand about the law.

319
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,192
Look, Maggie, if this child is mine,
I really need to know.

320
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,854
So can you spare a few minutes for someone
who might be the father of your baby?

321
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,193
Of course I can.

322
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,291
- Okay.
- But it's not you.

323
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,773
Oh, for God's sakes.

324
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,469
Oh, come on!

325
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,807
Fine.
Let me get Miss Fat Ass outta here...

326
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,972
- and I'll meet you in the car.
- Okay.

327
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,108
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>on the other side of Maggie's house...</i>

328
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,585
<i>Lindsay and Tobias were putting</i>
<i>their plan into action.</i>

329
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,180
- I'm cloaking myself in her scent.
- Oh! She's not blind.

330
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,191
Well, she was
when she bought this.

331
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,661
- Oh, my God! That's her!
- Get in the tub!

332
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,730
<i>Buster, meanwhile,</i>
<i>received an unexpected visitor.</i>

333
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,964
I want you to know that
it's okay for you to hide.

334
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,975
A man can hide.
There's a quiet courage in that.

335
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,977
You're a good uncle.

336
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,048
I'm not your uncle.
I'm your father.

337
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,378
- What?
- Shh. Shh. Quiet courage.

338
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,918
Quiet courage.
Hide.

339
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,420
<i>But Buster was confused.</i>

340
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,082
You lied to me.
Uncle Oscar's my father.

341
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,854
He just told me so. And maybe
you're not even my real mother.

342
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,192
For all I know, Lucille 2
is my real mother. Oh!

343
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,232
Buster, you were
never supposed to know.

344
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,427
Oh, yeah? Well, here's something
you should know. I'm going to war!

345
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,840
<i>Buster hadjust discovered</i>
<i>he'd been lied to by his parents.</i>

346
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,209
I'm going to war!

347
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,441
- You told him you were his father!
- I did no such thing!

348
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,710
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

349
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,086
George.

350
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,622
He must've come here
to say good-bye to Buster.

351
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,216
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Lucille snapped out ofher denial.</i>

352
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,455
My baby's going to war.

353
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,861
<i>Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>were gathering evidence...</i>

354
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,127
<i>that Maggie</i>
<i>was truly pregnant.</i>

355
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,135
<i>And they were</i>
<i>having fun doing it.</i>

356
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,035
That's the first time we were
in the shower since our honeymoon.

357
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,040
And this time, no tears.

358
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,872
Tobias, this is the box that
Michael was talking about. "60 pounds."

359
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,971
<i>But it didn't weigh 60 pounds.</i>

360
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,745
<i>Michael was stalling Maggie,</i>
<i>and they were also having fun.</i>

361
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,151
Sally Sitwell? You know,
I think I had her little play oven.

362
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,724
Yeah, I know. It's a funny name.
But she's a doll.

363
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,952
Yeah, I had one.

364
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,393
If you pull her hair,
she'd cry or something.

365
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,293
This one kinda
does that too.

366
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,662
- Hello.
- We got the pee, and we're gonna get it checked.

367
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,498
But, listen, you should know that
that box that says "60 pounds"-

368
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,799
it's actually
like two pounds.

369
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,876
I think she's pregnant, Michael.
I mean, there's baby stuff here and-

370
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,877
Tobias, stop it.
That's for the baby. It's not-

371
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,106
- <i>We're having a really good time.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

372
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,412
- Well, I kind of am too.
- Bye.

373
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,009
So, no more lies.
Tell me the truth.

374
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,750
If-lf that baby is mine,
maybe we're meant to be together.

375
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,261
Of course it is, Michael.

376
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,233
<i>But that's when the Fünkes</i>
<i>discovered what was in the box...</i>

377
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,325
<i>that was so easy to lift.</i>

378
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,264
- That's what it is.
- Okay, the box was light 'cause
it had a fake stomach in it.

379
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,003
It looks like she's faking it.
Oh, God. I hope you get this.

380
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,977
Wait up, please.

381
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,878
<i>And George Michael and Maeby</i>
<i>brought Ann to the penthouse...</i>

382
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,713
<i>in hopes that Lucille</i>
<i>would drive her away.</i>

383
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,548
Isn't Ann great?

384
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,451
- Oh, she's lovely.
- <i>Unfortunately...</i>

385
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,320
<i>she was distracted by</i>
<i>the thought oflosing Buster.</i>

386
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,155
Hey, do you have
any bread pudding?

387
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,321
<i>'Cause you'd be surprised</i>
<i>how much this one can put away.</i>

388
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,628
- Ha!
- Now that Buster's not here,
there's no one to finish it.

389
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,067
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if I ever eat again.</i>

390
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,041
You know,
when times are tough...

391
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,412
you can always turn to
the power of prayer.

392
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,849
Here we go.

393
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,546
Show me.

394
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,556
<i>This was a big get for God...</i>

395
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,990
<i>and Michael brought</i>
<i>Maggie home to meet his son.</i>

396
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,029
This is gonna be easy. He's been signing off
on everyone lately. Maybe he called.

397
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,598
Hey, so what's the deal on Zuckerkorn?

398
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,463
'Cause you know my fat case-
it's really pretty thin.

399
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,732
- Lying, untrustworthy-
- Yeah.

400
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,205
Plus, I heard he
hangs out at rest stops.

401
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,208
No, no. I'm talkin'
about you, Maggie.

402
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,210
I don't know why I'm surprised.
I shouldn't be.

403
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,177
You're a liar.
You lie.

404
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,273
Well, I mean, I <i>heard</i>
he hangs out at rest stops. Okay-

405
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,945
And I keep buying it too. And so maybe
there is something wrong with me.

406
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,919
I thought we were startin'
to trust each other.

407
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,016
I got a message from my sister saying
there's a box at your house with a fat suit in it.

408
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,119
- What've you got?
A different one for each trimester?
- You had your sister...

409
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,926
- break into my house?
- Which one are you wearin' right now?

410
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,933
Is this
the ready-to-burst model?

411
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,129
Now, there's
zero trust here. Good-bye.

412
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,264
It's been fun-

413
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,934
not.
- <i>Michael had hoped</i>
<i>something more dramatic...</i>

414
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,875
<i>would have</i>
<i>come out ofhis mouth.</i>

415
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,606
<i>Or at least more current.</i>

416
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,740
Oh, you're so right, Michael.
I really can't be trusted.

417
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,444
'Cause I'm fakin' it-

418
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,988
not.

419
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,153
Hello, Michael.
Well, my wife and I...

420
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,528
finally had the thrill of seeing
a plus sign on a pregnancy test.

421
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,726
You're gonna be a daddy!

422
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,096
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

423
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,572
<i>Barry gets a big break on his case.</i>

424
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,235
The fat girl in my
Skip Church's case? Not fat.

425
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,314
The attorney bought her a fat suit.
Oh! I've got another case.

426
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,075
Maggie is suing you
for paternity.

427
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,845
<i>And for the first time, Lucille prays.</i>

428
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,512
Take something else from us.
Do whatever you have to...

429
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,522
to keep my boy
from going to war.

430
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,524
<i>And Buster is on his way...</i>

431
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,323
<i>when he decides to pursue</i>
<i>a long-delayed rite of passage.</i>

432
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,695
<i>Loose seal!</i>
<i>Watch out for loose seal!</i>

433
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,859
I don't care about Lucille!

434
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,869
She lies!

435
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,996
<i>And then a seal bites offhis hand.</i>

436
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,165
Aaa-

437
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,503
...men.

found a family he fit in with.</i>

4
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:21,263
Where's Mother? Ah.

5
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,642
Ah, way to go, way to go.

6
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:27,265
Hi. I know you've been down today,

7
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,142
so I brought you this.

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,768
They're for Cinco.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,228

I am so blessed to have you in my life.

13

I'm so blessed to have you in my life.

14
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:44,949
Just six weeks ago, I was a hot mess.

15
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,534
I was desperate for a mother,

16
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:48,286
and I don't think I could admit it.

17
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:51,039
<i>NARRATOR: As you'll see,
he admits it plenty.</i>

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,832
But now look at me.

19
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:55,960
I'm with a beautiful, elegant woman!

20
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,795
(both laugh)

21
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:02,800
And I think we should
take it to the next level.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,681
<i>Buster had come a long way

<i>- ... was conquered... 
- (Bleep) baby.</i>

25
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,017
<i>And then rekindled, only to find himself</i>

26
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,061
<i>- facing a bigger fear.
- Oh, come on!</i>

27
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:20,897
<i>But his biggest fear wasn't confronting</i>

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,317
<i>a wet, loose seal; it was losing one.</i>

29
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,693
Wait! She doesn't have her makeup!

30
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:27,278

Mother!

32
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:30,991
- Michael.
- Yeah, it's a tough one

33
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:33,409
because there's about 400
witnesses that are ready

34
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:34,995
to throw her underneath the boat.

35
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,997
I don't think I can even help.

38

00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:44,462
<i>- Oh, Buster.
- Like this.</i>

40
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,755

41
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,090
- Oh.
- Uh, you want me to stay?

42
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:48,800

Oh, no, and just watch.

44
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,427
Mother is going to come

46
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:54,889

"Make sure you frisk that girl before... "

48
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:00,353

- That's my perfume.
- Mm, good.

50

Okay, good. She wouldn't wear that.

Hello to you, too, 2.

179
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,656
Oh, look at all this produce.

180
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,866
I'm juicing now. Would you like to join me?

181
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,286
It's 2: 00 in the afternoon.

182
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,829
Honey, it's 8: 00 a.m. somewhere.

183
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,289
Oh, I forgot... 

184
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,706
your mother wouldn't allow it.

185
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:15,751
(loudly): I don't care what she wants.

186
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,379
(quietly): Don't care what she wants.

187
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:21,132
I don't do everything she tells me.

188
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,717
Let's get juiced.

189
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,348
<i>NARRATOR: The next morning, Buster awoke</i>

190
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,849
<i>- with a vicious juice hangover.
- Oh.</i>

191
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,977
Well, that was a freebie.

192
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,395
(gasps)

193
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:35,938
Mother's trial.

194
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,523
(whimpers loudly)

195
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,526
BUSTER: Key witness!

196
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,236
Key witness coming through.

197
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,779
I'm a key... I... 

198
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,572
I was making two ban... 

199
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:47,116
(whimpers)

200
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,328
MARINES: Late last night,
it was drizzling rain!

201
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,288
I'm a key witness.

202
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,748
(Buster whimpering)

203
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,125
Is it over?

204
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,294
No, no, the grab-a-crab fest just started.

205
00:07:58,336 --> 00:07:59,670
Grab-a-crab?

206
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,256
Oh, ma'am, um... is... is there a verdict

207
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,091
<i>in the "my mother stole
theQueen Mary"thing?</i>

208
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,718
It's all up on the dailies board.

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,221
Dailies? What? Clam ch... (gasps)

210
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:10,639
LUCILLE: The fish is frozen here!

211
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:14,560
It's frozen! Do you really want
to spend $30 on frozen fish?

212
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,978
(gasps) Buster.

213
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,523
Where were you? This is all your fault.

214
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,815
No, I was making... was making a ban... 

215
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:21,275
- I was making two ban... 
- Save it.

216
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,069
I can smell the cran-apple
on you from here.

217
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,071
When... when are you coming home?

218
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,697
I'm serving three to five.

219
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,574
(gasps) Like the saltless pie?

220
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:31,536
I hope your juicy blender
bender was worth it.

221
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,205
Don't come to visit me
because I won't see you.

222
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,998
Oh, and good luck with your night terrors.

223
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,876
Now no one will be there
to hear your screams.

224
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,378
(screams)

225
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,256
Won't miss it!

226
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,717
Where... where do I go?

227
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,135
What do I do?

228
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,596
Where... where'd you get the pirate hat?

229
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:52,390
Where... where do I go?

230
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,434
<i>NARRATOR: And so Buster
went back to the penthouse,</i>

231
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,437
<i>feeling guilty and alone.</i>

232
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:00,106
<i>And he couldn't bear to
relive the time he was there</i>

233
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,566
<i>without Lucille before.</i>

234
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,318
I can't go through
another two days like that.

235
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,320
<i>And that's how Buster
decided to make another go</i>

236
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,822
<i>at making another go at Lucille 2.</i>

237
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,241
Buster.

238
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,700
My mother's gone away,

239
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:13,536
and I thought, you've always been like a... 

240
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,580
- Girlfriend.
- Not what I was gonna say.

241
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,915
Anyways, I was over there,
and my friend's over here,

242
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,167
and I thought, maybe I should just move in,

243
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,878
because I love to hear
all about your medications

244
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,422
and ailments and whatnot.

245
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,466
Is that baby toe of yours still crawling

246
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,342
over the others like a weird weed?

247
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,595
Oh, Buster, how sweet of you to remember.

248
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,054
Oh, it's one of my night terrors.

249
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,431
But listen, Buster,

250
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,142
- before I invite you into my arms... 
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:39,186
My bedroom, my bathtub with the railing... 

252
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:42,106
- Mm-hmm.
- I have to ask you something.

253
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,316
Mm-hmm.

254
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:44,900
Are you sure you're ready for this?

255
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,489
So, that pretend kid's bedroom,
is that not an option... ?

256
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,907
No, that room is all storage now, honey.

257
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,826
So, yes or no?

258
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:56,454
Are you ready to let go of your mother?

259
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,871
<i>NARRATOR: Buster thought he was,</i>

260
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,458
<i>although there was one ominous sign.</i>

261
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,835
I am ready for that, Lucille.

262
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,380
<i>Did you hear it?</i>

263
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,219
Wait. Did you just drop
the 2 after my name?

264
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,263
(laughing): Oh, I hope not.

265
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,807
That would be creepy.

266
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,809
<i>Before you accidentally skip back too far</i>

267
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,604
<i>and wind up in the middle
of the Maeby episode,</i>

268
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:24,148
<i>trust me, no "2" was spoken.</i>

269
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,401
<i>Every day, Buster visited the prison</i>

270
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,945
<i>where his mother was incarcerated.</i>

271
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:32,323
Buster Bluth and pie for his m... 

272
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,325
(sighs) Lucille Bluth.

273
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:36,910
Hmm... 

274
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,498
<i>And every day, she refused to see him.</i>

275
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,748
LUCILLE: No.

276
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,000
BUSTER: Oh.

277
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,293
She doesn't want to see you.

278
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,420
Excellent.

279
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,466
(crying)

280
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,385
<i>He even pretended to be</i>

281
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:55,596
<i>an old college flame of
Lucille's to gain admittance.</i>

282
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:57,806
Hello.

283
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,520
Alex Trebek?

284
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,938
<i>She then rephrased it in
the form of a question.</i>

285
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,899
Who is Alex Trebek?

286
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,775
Buster.

287
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:14,240
- No, Buster.
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:20,204
Do you have a pie or a
small sponge cake available?

289
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:23,290
- Ah. Thank you.
- Here you go.

290
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,668
<i>And while his days were spent trying to get</i>

291
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,461
<i>- his mother to love him... 
- LUCILLE 2: Oh, Buster!</i>

292
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,338
<i>- You're just in time.
- ... his nights were consumed</i>

293
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,881
<i>with getting his lover to mother him.</i>

294
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,593
I hope you are in the
mood for a hot tomato.

295
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,094
Mmm. Soup?

296
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:37,221
With little grilled cheese
sandwiches on the side.

297
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,599
Buster, that was innuendo.

298
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,100
- Oh.
- My Lord, it's like

299
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:42,976
we're speaking different languages here.

300
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,395
No, it's not.

301
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,730
It is working.

302
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,856
I'm getting hungry.

303
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:50,025
For love?

304
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,485
Oh, God, is this another

305
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,238
one of those nights where
nothing is as it seems

306
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,490
and there's no cream pie for dessert?

307
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,534
Holy Toledo, Buster, sometimes I think

308
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:01,287
I'm nothing but a Horn & Hardart to you.

309
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,080
Oh! What happened to innuendo?

310
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,831
Let's do it quick.

311
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:06,959
It's an old restaurant.

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,753
(laughing): Oh! A restaurant!

313
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:10,212
I don't care if it's old!

314
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,505
Look who I'm dating!

315
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,299
Let's go there. Let's go there now.

316
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,511
Buster, you can either
be a son or a lover... 

317
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:20,180
and right now, you're
no good to me as a lover.

318
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,391
Maybe you're right.

319
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,936
Maybe this has been wrong from the start.

320
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,147
- So... Mom.
- Out.

321
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:29,774
<i>And since he couldn't bear</i>

322
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,233
<i>- to go back to the penthouse... 
- Out!</i>

323
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,485
You know, if tomorrow, you don't open up

324
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:33,902
and let someone else in... 

325
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:35,488
<i>Buster needed to raise some money.</i>

326
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,615
(on TV): then the
treasures you have inside... 

327
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,575
This is my Motherboy Four medal.

328
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:41,994
That's when I was a kangaroo in her pouch.

329
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,996
What'll you give me for it?

330
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:48,501
<i>But Buster wasn't the first
Motherboy to hit hard times.</i>

331
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,503
What will you give me for these?

332
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,087
All-time low.

333
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,381
<i>And that's when Buster found inspiration.</i>

334
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:57,343
She certainly looks proud of her son.

335
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,222
(singsongy): I'm back!

336
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,267
<i>As it turned out, Buster
returned on the very day</i>

337
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,729
<i>the Army policy regarding
sexual orientation had changed.</i>

338
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,855
- Are you gay?
- No.

339
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:12,024
- You can tell me.
- I'm not.

340
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:13,192
SOLDIER 2: It's okay.

341
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:14,067
Drew, tell him.

342
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,778
- I'm gay.
- Oh.

343
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,987
- Peter's gay.
- Oh... 

344
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,071
- Sergeant Melnick's gay.
- Oh.

345
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:19,198
(sighing): Bi.

346
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,991
Oh, sorry, he's bi.

347
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,493
No, I'm going home for the day.

348
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,868
I'm gay.

349
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,329
Yeah, it really makes no difference to us.

350
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,707
- We'll find something for you.
- Perfect.

351
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,916
I was looking for something.

352
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,961
You said "something," right?

353
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,588
<i>And that's how Buster officially</i>

354
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,716
<i>reenlisted in the Army.</i>

355
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,176
<i>And it's why, six months later,</i>

356
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,219
<i>- SOLDIER: Lucille Bluth.
- Lucille Bluth</i>

357
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,762
<i>got some bad news.</i>

358
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,097
Yes?

359
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,184
I'm here to see you about your son.

360
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,477
Oh, this is a ploy.

361
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,020
He's trying to get me to see him.

362
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,938
How do I know you're really in the Army?

363
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,650
Who did Larry Kert replace in Company?

364
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,026
I don't know.

365
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,820
I know who he thought he was replacing,

366
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:59,739
and it was Dean Jones.

367
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,156
But he didn't come close.

368
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,742
(shudders anxiously)

369
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,577
My Buster?

370
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:05,786
<i>And Lucille rushed to the hospital.</i>

371
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,912
What happened? Where's my son?

372
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,207
Mrs. Bluth, your son went
down while piloting a plane

373
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,085
- over Afghanistan.
- Oh, my God... 

374
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:15,671
He deserves a big hand for
that and we gave him one.

375
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:18,591
I'm afraid, besides that,
there's nothing we can do.

376
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,220
(Buster gasps)

377
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,597
Hi, Mother.

378
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:26,932
Well, you look fine.

379
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:28,267
The doctor said you went down

380
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:30,644
while piloting a plane over Afghanistan.

381
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,855
Oh, yeah, that plane was in Afghanistan.

382
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,981
<i>It seems the Army had taken advantage</i>

383
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,735
<i>of Buster's childlike interest in games.</i>

384
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,738
This is so much more
fun than "Guess the Fur."

385
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,032
<i>And his childlike inability to distinguish</i>

386
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,452
<i>- between games and reality.
- Oh! (laughs)</i>

387
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:49,705
<i>So they set him up as a drone pilot here.</i>

388
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,332
Want to go to lunch, Private Bluth?

389
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:55,669
Not till I take out the hospital!

390
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,630
I tell you, this kid's amazing.

391
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:01,216
If I had him back in the '60s,
Cuba would be the 51st state.

392
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:04,428
You're not gonna get away
from me, little nurse! Aah!

393
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,555
<i>He had been playing for 47 straight hours.</i>

394
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:10,225
Take that, Taliban
wedding! (laughing wildly)

395
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,353
<i>But like anyone who plays
video games for too long,</i>

396
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,939
<i>he started to make mistakes.</i>

397
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,775
Hey, Bluth, you just took
out an art museum in Madrid.

398
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,568
Oh, you can go to Spain in this thing?

399
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,945
Maybe you should take a break.

400
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,070
You could've hurt some innocent people.

401
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,155
Innocent people?!

402
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,865
(gasps) You mean I've been

403
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,492
hurting guilty people?!

404
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,411
<i>But Buster was a peaceful man.</i>

405
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:30,788
(Buster screaming) Oh, God!

406
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,956
Pilot down!

407
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,666
- (alarm wailing)
- Medic!

408
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,501
<i>It was the kind of emergency</i>

409
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,919
<i>that the drone pilot paramedics
had long been waiting for.</i>

410
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,295
I got a man down!

411
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,839
Sorry we're late.

412
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,548
Some kid swallowed an
eye at the Build-A-Bear.

413
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,926
Why do they have us at a mini-mall?

414
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,177
<i>- (defibrillator clacks, whines)
- It was the first</i>

415
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,428
<i>known injury to a drone pilot</i>

416
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,180
<i>and the Army took it seriously.</i>

417
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:50,850
Apparently, no one told him
that they were real planes.

418
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,267
If this guy comes after us,

419
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,478
they could pull funding
for the whole program.

420
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,772
So, how do we buy off ol' One Arm?

421
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,107
First we gotta find something he needs.

422
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,401
Well, we do have the bionics program.

423
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,195
Ice cream.

424
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:05,572
Maybe we shouldn't be discussing this here.

425
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,867
Yeah, I think we're at those kids' table.

426
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,661
So you fell out of a chair,

427
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,913
and for this, the government
gives you applause?

428
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:15,374
No... a big hand.

429
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:18,878
I thought I recognized
that little son of a bitch.

430
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,963
This is why you can't keep a job

431
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,297
(muffled): at one hospital!

432
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,843
Why does it have to be so big?

433
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,804
Well, they said the
miniaturization comes later.

434
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:32,182
I mean, you remember how big
your first cell phone was.

435
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,018
That was a phone.

436
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,562
This looks like you're pointing
to a place that buys your gold.

437
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,647
I haven't learned how to control it.

438
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,232
They're gonna work with me.

439
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:42,526
So you had me come out
here under false pretenses?

440
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,945
You wouldn't come here any other way!

441
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,572
You haven't seen me in a year.

442
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:49,241
It's why I went to Army... to win you back.

443
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,535
You have to forgive me!

444
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,038
It's not about forgiving
you. Although I don't.

445
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,998
- (groans)
- You need to grow up, Buster,

446
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,667
because I can't take care of you anymore.

447
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,545
I need to "get away-get away."

448
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,839
You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster.

449
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,132
It's as if they wrote
that song for my own son.

450
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:09,177
- Hm?
- I'm glad you have a new hand.

451
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,388
But you need to find
someone else to hold it.

452
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,016
Tell the prison limo to come around!

453
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:17,227
Fine! I got my own family now... Army!

454
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,771
And they want me!

455
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,022
You guys want me, right?

456
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,648
Oh, yeah. They're not gonna invest

457
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,358
this kind of money without
wanting you for keeps.

458
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,527
- (laughing): Oh, good.
- Once you learn how to use

459
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,779
that thing, they're going to turn you

460
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,738
into a killing monster.

461
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,489
Monster... ?

462
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,033
This doesn't make me look sexy.

463
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:32,242
Throw it out.

464
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,369
Well, that explains the photo shoot.

465
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,915
<i>And so Buster began a rehab program</i>

466
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,499
<i>he was terrified to succeed at.</i>

467
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,085
Open the cabinet, please.

468
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:45,547
Mm... mm... mm... mm!

469
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:46,840
Oh... 

470
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,258
Too hard.

471
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,802
Uh, I think that was too hard.

472
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:51,011
- Okay.
- Yeah.

473
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,764
Let's just grab that toothpaste.

474
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,223
Okay.

475
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,059
- Use your new hand.
- Okay.

476
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:58,769
Oh!

477
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,353
I got some on you.

478
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,522
Uh... yeah.

479
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:05,317
- You did get some on me.
- Yeah.

480
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:07,736
<i>- Too hard?
- Buster seemed slow to master the challenges.</i>

481
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:10,196
GUNNER: Yeah, that's... that's on her.

482
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:12,365
- He got a little... 
- It was too hard.

483
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:13,951
I think it was, as well.

484
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,870
Let's go ahead and fast-forward
through the commercials.

485
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,371
Okay, that's too fa... okay, stop.

486
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:19,873
Well, there's Jon Cryer.

487
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,249
Stop! That's Jon Cryer!

488
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,459
(remote blipping)

489
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,003
Well, look at that... 

490
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:25,879
we're back at the
Progressive Insurance lady.

491
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm better off just
watching the commercials!

492
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:29,883
Don't say that.

493
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,969
<i>But behind the two-way mirror,</i>

494
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,262
<i>hope wasn't in abundance.</i>

495
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:36,974
Hope this guy likes the music
acts on Saturday Night Live

496
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,267
because he's gonna be
watching a lot of them.

497
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,687
- How many remotes do we have?
- That was the only one.

498
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,772
There's seven monitors
here... we have one remote.

499
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:45,357
Do we have anybody from Pinky Team?

500
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,151
PHYSICAL THERAPIST: Guys, he can't do this!

501
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,987
<i>And around week five,
the Army finally realized</i>

502
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,739
<i>that Buster was in no hurry to leave.</i>

503
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,825
Aah! I blew it again!

504
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,242
I'll never do it right!

505
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:58,704
I'm a monst... 

506
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,372
Do you have any ice cream?

507
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:02,541
Maybe it would work with ice cream.

508
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,292
And now he wants ice cream.

509
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,378
He's using us.

510
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,714
Yeah, it might be time for the Q-test.

511
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,507
The Q-test?

512
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,804
Oh... 

513
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,764
I'm sorry, we're running behind
with your testing, Buster.

514
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,516
We'll just be a few more minutes.

515
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,143
Okay.

516
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,978
(gasps) Oh... well... !

517
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,022
<i>And it was then that Gunner learned why</i>

518
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,899
<i>- it was called the Q-test.
- Oh.</i>

519
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,776
Aren't you the "cu-test"?

520
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:33,947
COLONEL: Now, he can't see
us at all... that's correct?

521
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:35,908
- (cat meowing)
- BUSTER: I know!

522
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:37,617
GUNNER: Why wouldn't he be able to see us?

523
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,120
- BUSTER: You looking around?
- Because it's a mirror.

524
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,414
No, it's a window.

525
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:44,332
- (cat purring)
- BUSTER: Oh, hi.

526
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:48,587
COLONEL: Okay, let's take it down.

527
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:50,172
BUSTER: I know, I know... 

528
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,092
COLONEL: Send in the authority figure.

529
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,468
- Hi.
- (cat purring)(Door opens)

530
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,303
(clears throat)

531
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,681
How are you managing
with that hand, solider?

532
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:01,183
(Buster gasps)

533
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,102
(cat meowing, Buster whimpering)

534
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:05,311
(cat meowing)

535
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,275
(Buster whimpers)

536
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,073
<i>Buster was being discharged from the Army.</i>

537
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,991
So, where am I supposed to go?

538
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,492
What am I supposed to do?

539
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:21,494
I... I have nowhere to live.

540
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:24,289
You should've thought about that
before you let that cat live.

541
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,291
<i>- And that's when he met Ophelia Love... 
- Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

542
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,794
<i>The devoted wife of the
candidate Herbert Love,</i>

543
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,587
<i>- who was on a tour... 
- I have nowhere to go.</i>

544
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,464
<i>- Of the Veterans' Hospital.
- Excuse me.</i>

545
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:34,174
You're a veteran and
you have nowhere to go?

546
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:35,592
Oh, it's not Army's fault.

547
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,385
I'm a monster.

548
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:39,179
And what makes you think you're a monster?

549
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,181
What do you see when you look at this?

550
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:45,060
I see a veteran whose
hand I'd like to shake.

551
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:47,062
Not that one.

552
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:49,439
I think you should meet my husband.

553
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,357
We may have something for you.

554
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,860
Perfect! Wait, you didn't
say "nothing," did you?

555
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:56,905
- Something.
- "Something." Got it.

556
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:58,490
HERBERT: Look how big his hand is.

557
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:00,159
<i>But Herbert would be less enthusiastic.</i>

558
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,785
And you want him to live with us?

559
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,954
Well, he's a vet, Herbert.

560
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,081
And you yourself said you need something

561
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:08,374
to compete with the woman
you're running against.

562
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:12,129
<i>Lucille 2 had recently adopted
a Hispanic boy named Perfecto.</i>

563
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,755
And since you're never around, I mean,

564
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:15,257
he could help me with the boys.

565
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,634
<i>It's like that movie The Blind Side.</i>

566
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,763
I suppose we could use
a Blind Side Monster.

567
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:24,266
Well, we shouldn't call him a monster.

568
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,226
That's why I love you, Ophelia.

569
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:31,190
You've got a heart as big as
that Blind Side Monster's hand.

570
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:32,858
(boy screaming)

571
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,067
- (gasping)
- Oh!

572
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,069
<i>And so it was decided</i>

573
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,197
<i>Buster was to stay with the Love family.</i>

574
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,241
He's fine. He's fine. He's fine.

575
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,076
- Welcome to the family.
- Oh!

576
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,162
<i>He'd found a home at last.</i>

577
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,039
- Oh!
- Oh! Uh-uh, uh-uh!

578
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,791
(all laughing)

579
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,584
<i>In the following weeks,
Buster came in handy</i>

580
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,295
<i>to the entire Love family: </i>

581
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,797
<i>- Helping the boys at school... 
- (School bell ringing)</i>

582
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,259
This table is for National
Honor Society members only.

583
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,468
Really.

584
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,595
Well, what about these two guys?

585
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:03,889
Were they invited?

586
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,182
Light drizzle... 

587
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,850
and thunder.

588
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,020
- What?!
- See, light drizzle will just annoy you

589
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,149
but, you see, thunder... will "F" you up!

590
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:16,818
<i>This got the attention of Perfecto Telles,</i>

591
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,572
<i>vice president of the
student anti-bullying squad.</i>

592
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:23,242
<i>Buster even received a
badge from an undercover cop</i>

593
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,701
<i>that was posing as a teacher.</i>

594
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,453
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

595
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:30,290
Whether he's an attention
hog who looks just like you,

596
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:32,084
or whether he's half your size.

597
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,295
(growls, giggles, screams)

598
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,006
<i>He used his finely-honed
skills as a doting son</i>

599
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:39,383
<i>to give the long-neglected Ophelia</i>

600
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,176
<i>some much-deserved attention.</i>

601
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:42,761
Pour in the liquor... 

602
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:44,388
Don't want the boys to see... 

603
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,265
You throw in some cola... 

604
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,474
Got a Coke and Hennessy!

605
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:49,935
(laughs)

606
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,728
Just for you, Mother Love.

607
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,313
- Buster... 
- Mm... 

608
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,899
You are the most considerate
man I've ever met.

609
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,944
Oh, stop! You're embarrassing me!

610
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:00,653
And sweet and... 

611
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:02,739
No, I'm serious... stop, stop.

612
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,032
But your other hand is waving me on.

613
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:05,700
Oh, is that going again?

614
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:07,286
I think it's on demo.

615
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,371
Do you have a pencil or a paper clip?

616
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:11,790
<i>And he helped Herbert
on the campaign trail.</i>

617
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,042
Let me show you what a
government handout looks like.

618
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,459
Hold your government hand out.

619
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:19,089
Yeah! And let's give
freedom from government

620
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,924
a big thumbs-up!

621
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,467
<i>Although the hadn't
achieved complete mastery.</i>

622
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,720
- Come on, Buster, dance!
- I don't want to dance.

623
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,639
Come on, dance, Buster!

624
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,057
<i>Buster was enjoying his new role</i>

625
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:31,601
<i>as a symbol of government waste.</i>

626
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,477
It's like I said about contraception:

627
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,521
If you want me to pay for her diaphragm,

628
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:39,359
- I get to put my hand in her... 
- Shoe!

629
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,987
Nice stop, Blind Side Monster.

630
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:44,281
Buster... Blind Side Buster.

631
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,866
<i>And he was feeling more
confident every day.</i>

632
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,160
Mm!

633
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,619
HERBERT: Okay... 

634
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,080
Give him a big hand back!

635
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:53,790
(applause)

636
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,125
<i>Arguably, too confident.</i>

637
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,128
HERBERT: Hey!

638
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,587
(Buster giggling)

639
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:00,630
Okay, hey, hey... Oh-ho!

640
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,966
BUSTER: Hah! Hm! (giggles)

641
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,468
<i>Although, after this appearance,</i>

642
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:07,762
<i>he spent a lot less time with Herbert.</i>

643
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:10,974
<i>And a lot more time with Ophelia.</i>

644
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,976
<i>- (people screaming)
- Which is what led to this.</i>

645
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,690
That's funny, no smoke came out.

646
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,275
Smoke?

647
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:21,485
Wait, what just happened?

648
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:23,278
This.

649
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,491
Okay, okay, okay.

650
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,533
So you don't think that the next level

651
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:31,535
is adult adoption, do you?

652
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:33,997
Come on, Buster.

653
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,540
You've been flirting with me since day one.

654
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:37,541
What?

655
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,002
Bringing me these flowers,

656
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,587
offering to undress me.

657
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:43,048
What about the singing?

658
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:47,427
"Sealed with a kiss" through
the door while I bathed?

659
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:48,970
Right.

660
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:50,638
Mother stuff. (chuckles)

661
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,725
(whispers): I mean, you're married.

662
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,147
What is this?

663
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:04,319
That is my husband, with a prostitute.

664
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:08,781
I've worn a captain's hat with
someone who had hair like that.

665
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:10,867
But I... I can't... 

666
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,953
I mean, you're like a mother to me.

667
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:18,417
You can either be a son or a lover to me.

668
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:21,044
- (gasps)
- And I already have two sons.

669
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,505
<i>And perhaps it was the fear
that she'd throw him out,</i>

670
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:25,006
<i>or he finally did grow up,</i>

671
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:28,676
<i>but that night, Buster acted like a man.</i>

672
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:33,681
<i>NARRATOR: After spending
the night with Ophelia Love,</i>

673
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,267
<i>Buster proudly went to visit his mother.</i>

674
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:36,684
I came here to thank you.

675
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:41,481
You were trying to push
me out of the nest... 

676
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,066
and you were right.

677
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,443
- Really?
- Yes.

678
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:45,735
I've grown.

679
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,862
And I'm in love.

680
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,573
Hamster or turtle?

681
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:50,990
(laughs): No, Mother.

682
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:52,075
Hamsters are gross.

683
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,410
It's a female.

684
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:55,203
Human. Female human. Whole thing.

685
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:58,164
So your parental
responsibilities are complete.

686
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,249
Hot.

687
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,461
I no longer need you.

688
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:03,920
Well, you don't have to go that far.

689
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,755
I'm not a mother boy anymore.

690
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:09,593
I'm a mother man.

691
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,932
Use your good hand.

692
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:19,769
Guards!

693
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,731
<i>And on his way back to his new love,</i>

694
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:25,942
<i>Buster ran into Michael,</i>

695
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,777
<i>who was trying to get the life story rights</i>

696
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,489
<i>from one of the few
remaining family members</i>

697
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,949
<i>he hadn't thrown out of the movie.</i>

698
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,950
What about Mom?

699
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,368
I have her, but I'm about to

700
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,870
throw it in her face when I see her,

701
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,414
and I can't go to my son.

702
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,958
Well, I have nothing to be ashamed about.

703
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,461
I'm in love.

704
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,506
And do you want to hear
something so surprising?

705
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:50,049
She started out as my mother figure.

706
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,051
<i>- Not surprising.
- And he returned back</i>

707
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:55,388
<i>to his love nest to tell
Ophelia the good news.</i>

708
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,931
I'm out of the thing!

709
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:58,350
How did yours go?

710
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:00,477
- It's over.
- (Sighs)

711
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,103
I talked to Herbert, I told
him everything about us,

712
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,104
and it's over.

713
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:05,649
Mm. I know it's scary.

714
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,360
I just got out of a long relationship, too.

715
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,611
But I'm here for you.

716
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,531
And, girl, I ain't going nowhere.

717
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,240
I need you to leave.

718
00:27:14,282 --> 00:27:15,699
Mm, so let's get it o... !

719
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,035
Wait, what's happening?

720
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:18,786
He wants to try to change.

721
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:21,540
He wants a second chance,
and I want to give it to him.

722
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:23,749
What... 

723
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,710
So you... you were just
using me to hurt him?

724
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:29,047
Yes.

725
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:30,298
(whispers): Thank you.

726
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,300
But what... what about me?

727
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:34,219
What happens to me?

728
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,556
I... I certainly can't go
back to you as my mother.

729
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:40,392
After I've zipped down, you
can't expect me to zip up!

730
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:41,601
I know that.

731
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,102
But you have to leave.

732
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:45,522
Oh, no, I'm okay with the mothering.

733
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,315
I mean, he had you first, I'm here to stay.

734
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:49,108
It's just a little
mother/son bump in the road.

735
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,070
Mother, I ain't going nowhere.

736
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:55,281
Your hand is broken again.

737
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:58,826
No, it's just my heart.

738
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:01,621
Oh, it's my hand, too, actually.

739
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:02,706
I'm sorry, Buster.

740
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:03,873
<i>Buster was blindsided.</i>

741
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,791
Ophelia!

742
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,419
Tell me this.

743
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,878
Who is a better lover?

744
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,422
- He is.
- He is. Okay.

745
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:12,965
What about son?!

746
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:15,885
<i>Buster was hurt.</i>

747
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:20,223
<i>And perhaps that's why he availed himself</i>

748
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,017
<i>to the photos of Herbert
and the prostitute.</i>

749
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:26,688
<i>And Buster, furious,</i>

750
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,609
<i>decided to expose Herbert himself.</i>

751
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,984
(wailing)

752
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:34,320
<i>But not before using the wrong hand</i>

753
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,114
<i>to punch a picture of Herbert.</i>

754
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:37,616
Stupid Bust... !

755
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:41,453
<i>Unfortunately, it was the night of Cinco,</i>

756
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:44,581
<i>and no one was home to find him.</i>

757
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,333
Sad. Sad.

758
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,418
(grunts)

759
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:56,301
<i>Buster came to and rushed
to Cinco to share the photos</i>

760
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,386
<i>with Herbert Love's political enemy,</i>

761
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:02,390
<i>when he ran into Tobias,
who enlisted Buster's help</i>

762
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:06,603
<i>for a musical that was becoming
less fantastic every minute.</i>

763
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,896
But I've got to find Lucille 2,
I've got to give her pictures.

764
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:11,190
- I don't know the songs.
- It's prerecorded.

765
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,318
You're a monster, you
don't have to be any good.

766
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,695
- What?
- Now just go Thing your heart out

767
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:17,905
and don't be put off by
the freakishly large... 

768
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:19,365
What... Oh, God!

769
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:20,742
Okay, well, well, good.

770
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:22,494
Then just the, uh, the one glove will do,

771
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:24,870
and, uh... perfecto!

772
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,038
(chuckles)

773
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,624
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

774
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,502
<i>Perfecto Telles was also
in need of a monster.</i>

775
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:33,129
He's a bully. So I want
you to "bad cop" him

776
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,172
for me a little, okay?

777
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,507
Yeah, yeah.

778
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:36,882
<i>And that's when he heard his name.</i>

779
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:38,718
Perfecto!

780
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,012
And he's a real bully.

781
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:43,222
He's taking money from this
innocent young high school girl.

782
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:44,641
Ugh, I don't think I can help you.

783
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,476
- Please.
- (Whispers): I don't want to be

784
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,353
- a monster anymore.
- Can't you just

785
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:51,230
show him a little thunder?
Just to scare him a bit?

786
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:54,150
<i>And that's when Buster saw
the woman he'd come for.</i>

787
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,694
I'm sorry.

788
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:58,070
I have to take care of something.

789
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:00,824
Lucille 2.

790
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,201
- I've been looking for you.
- Buster!

791
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:04,494
You look different;
something's happened to you.

792
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,578
Yes.

793
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,455
I've been with a black woman.

794
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:08,914
I was talking about your hand.

795
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:11,334
Oh. This huge thing? Yeah, it's new.

796
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,378
Of course, the week after
I got it, the six came out.

797
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,129
You can play a flute with that one.

798
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,381
It comes with a flute!

799
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:17,841
But I'm not here about that.

800
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,759
I'm here about this.

801
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,511
What is this?

802
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:25,097
Oh, just pictures of Herbert
Love with a lady of the night.

803
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:29,018
And he's gotten himself in some
pretty hot ham water this time.

804
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,689
I want you to humiliate
him and win the election.

805
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,524
That's my wig.

806
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,984
Buster, this is priceless;
why are you giving it to me?

807
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:38,486
Because I want to hurt him.

808
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,864
I've never known you
to want to hurt anybody.

809
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,742
Well, I hurt my mother, didn't I?

810
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:45,993
I missed her trial, and
she cut me out of her life.

811
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:47,620
- But I'm over that!
- Really?

812
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:50,164
Then you have me to thank for that.

813
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:52,500
- What do you mean?
- Oh, Buster,

814
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,545
you think missing her
trial was an accident?

815
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,505
Yes.

816
00:30:57,547 --> 00:30:59,131
Buster, I helped you with that.

817
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:01,801
<i>Although "helped" might not be</i>

818
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:03,386
<i>the best description of what she did.</i>

819
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,513
<i>In fact, she'd been laying in wait for him.</i>

820
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,807
Oh, Buster!

821
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,934
Hello!

822
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,773
<i>And once she'd gotten
Buster into the apartment,</i>

823
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:16,900
<i>she eschewed the all-natural
juice for the kind</i>

824
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,903
<i>with cartoon animals
and riddles on the box.</i>

825
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,574
<i>The type Buster had been
known to have a weakness for.</i>

826
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,451
Thank you.

827
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:29,454
<i>And soon, the partying was off the hook,</i>

828
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,748
<i>with Buster drinking right out of the box.</i>

829
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,460
Oh, this is just like Mother's Day Eve!

830
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:36,920
- (laughs)
- (Playing piano off-key)

831
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,630
<i>Although, at one point,</i>

832
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,006
<i>he did have something close to an insight.</i>

833
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:43,050
I mean, how do you miss a sign like that?

834
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:44,427
Oh.

835
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:49,014
I was tinkling!

836
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,182
(laughs)

837
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:51,476
You kept me from mother?

838
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,853
You sent her to prison?

839
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:55,396
And this whole time, I thought about

840
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,606
getting back together with you.

841
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,483
Well, you're a little late, honey.

842
00:31:58,524 --> 00:32:01,360
I've been dating your father
for the past couple of weeks.

843
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,656
(growls)

844
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,576
<i>Buster was in a whirl.</i>

845
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:14,248
<i>Confused and betrayed, he
wanted to punch something.</i>

846
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,917
<i>Which is why he went here.</i>

847
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,085
Hey! I need to punch something!

848
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,379
Even if it is a poor little donkey.

849
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,548
<i>But it wasn't that kind of donkey punch.</i>

850
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,508
(gasps)

851
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,551
Oh, I need some juice.

852
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:28,053
(sighs)

853
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:31,516
Perhaps uno mas, señor,
to feed to the fishes?

854
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:33,309
Gene Parmesan.

855
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,311
This is not my real job.

856
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,438
<i>And that's when Buster heard his target.</i>

857
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,774
HERBERT: I got to go up and give my speech.

858
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:41,860
You!

859
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,111
Oh, hey, it's the Blind Side Monster.

860
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:46,155
(yells)

861
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,616
<i>And so he blindsided him and became one.</i>

862
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:49,909
(shrieks)

863
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,202
<i>And it was amidst</i>

864
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,663
<i>the rampaging of the blowback</i>

865
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,957
<i>that a juiced-up Buster
noticed something horrifying.</i>

866
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:58,042
(firecrackers popping, whistling)

867
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,670
(screaming)

868
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,630

(panting)

871
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:13,641
Oh, no.

872
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:16,477
I'm in the movie.

873
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,646
(whimpers): Oh, no.

874
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:23,985

875
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:25,945
<i>Buster tries to cover his tracks.</i>

876
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:26,863
Hey, nephew!

877
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,155
- (screams)
- New hand.

878
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:29,782
It's cool. That's cool.

879
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:33,202
You know that super-duper
privacy software you have?

880
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,287
Does that work on security cameras?

881
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:36,247
Of course, yeah.

882
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:37,582
Works on everything.

883
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:38,666
May I borrow it?

884
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,710
One second.

885
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:44,005
Here you go, Uncle Buster. I put it on

886
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,757
a hard drive for you. Just
please be careful with it.

887
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:47,592
(laughs): Of course, of course.

888
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:48,968
(crunching)

889
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,595
(whimpers softly)

890
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:53,097
Have you got one with a case?

891
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:54,557
BUSTER: Hey, Carl.

892
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,767
Buster!

893
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:57,476
<i>And Buster visits</i>

894
00:33:57,518 --> 00:34:00,312
<i>a Balboa Towers guard
he'd known for many years</i>

895
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,940
<i>for an impromptu lesson</i>

896
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:05,317
<i>on how their footage
is gathered and stored.</i>

897
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,736
May I use your phone?

898
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,238
<i>But when Carl steps away,</i>

899
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,823
<i>Buster goes into action</i>

900
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:13,826
<i>and attempts to Fakeblock the footage.</i>

901
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:15,411
- (steady ticking)
- Oh.

902
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,581
Sounds like it's working.

903
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,582
(sighs)

904
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,834
(grunting rhythmically)

905
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,836
(steady ticking continues)

906
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,051
(gasps)

907
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,010
Buster.

908
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,177
Hey, Carl.

909
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,013
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

910
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:35,180
Bye, Carl.

911
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:36,891
- Bye-bye, Buster.
- Okay.

912
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,149
(grunting rhythmically over video)

913
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,529
What she did to this boy.

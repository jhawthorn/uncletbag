1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,801
<i>Tonight, an</i> Arrested Development
<i>you can't miss.</i>

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,839
<i>A cavalcade of stars.</i>

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,173
<i>The shocking final moments
will be presented live.</i>

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,405
<i>And one of these people...</i>

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,784
<i>will die.</i>

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,280
<i>- The Bluths were desperate.</i>
- I assume you've seen this.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,483
<i>The press had them
all but finished.</i>

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,789
<i>- What? What is it?</i>
- This isn't gonna work over the phone, Dad.

9
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,022
Then get Bob Loblaw to hire me
another surrogate.

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,759
That's kind of the point.
Mr. Loblaw no longer works for us...

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,131
because someone wanted a boyfriend.

12
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,568
- Well, don't blame me.
- I was talking to Lindsay, actually.

13
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,265
But he was clearly turned off
to the both of you.

14
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:46,903
Now, we're gonna need a new lawyer. And that
is going to mean about a $100,000 retainer.

15
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,540
If we want a chance of keeping this family
going past the next few weeks...

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,084
we're gonna have to pull out
all the stops.

17
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,555
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about all of you getting jobs.

18
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,921
The best place to look for a job...

19
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,256
Who threw the tomato?

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,421
<i>How the hell are we gonna
get a hundred grand?</i>

21
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,556
I know this isn't exactly
what you're looking for...

22
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,294
but Maeby was just accepted
into private school.

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,394
- I've sent the check in already.
- No, that's not what I'm lookin' for at all.

24
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,632
Michael, it's the most
prestigious private school in town.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,572
Oh, no. Not the Milford Academy.

26
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,509
<i>Children were neither to be seen nor heard...</i>

27
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,671
<i>at the school Buster had attended.</i>

28
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,080
It's the exact opposite.
It's called "Openings."

29
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,643
Oh, great. That sounds like another one
of those gradeless, structureless...

30
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,655
New Age "feel-gooderies."

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,454
They teach self-expression and getting
in touch with feelings, Michael.

32
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,530
- I mean, I know you don't have any.
- The boy who couldn't cry.

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,530
He's a robot!

34
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,066
Oh, Michael can cry.
He just doesn't wanna rust.

35
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,001
Yes, he's like the Steel Man
from <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,164
- Tin Man?
- Is that what he's called?

37
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,470
- He knows. - Since you sent the check,
this is how you're gonna pay for it.

38
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,944
You're gonna be in charge of the house.
Cooking, cleaning, all of it.

39
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,483
You're going to put Lindsay in charge
of the cooking? At least you'll lose weight.

40
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,350
You know, Mom, I think the only time you ever
cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died.

41
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,513
You gave us cereal in an ashtray.

42
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,818
Gob, pal? How about you?
Can you find some work?

43
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,893
Oh, sure, Michael.

44
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,053
As what? A waiter?

45
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,188
Can I get you something, madam?

46
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,965
- I will have a vodka, though.
- What? Oh.

47
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:22,064
If you'd ever accidentally worked a day in your life,
you'd know there's no indignity in it.

48
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,642
Great. She'll have a vodka.

49
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,235
<i>Instead of selling out,
becoming housewives and waiters...</i>

50
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,644
<i>why don't we have a big event?</i>

51
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,979
Some sort of “Save Our Bluths" type thing.

52
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,655
<i>We'll throw a legal defense fund dinner.
Ask for donations.</i>

53
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,657
As long as we don't look desperate.

54
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,421
We want 'em to think we'll take their help,
but don't need it.

55
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,429
I should be seen a lot at the club.

56
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,398
Yeah, our backs are against the wall,
and it's just hard to accept...

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,400
that it's really come to begging.

58
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,027
<i>Sometimes it's the only way to stay in the game.</i>

59
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,436
<i>Please tell your friends about this show.</i>

60
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,274
<i>Michael had asked Lindsay
to take care of the house.</i>

61
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,378
<i>- And to his surprise, she was sort of doing it.</i>
- You're sort of doing it.

62
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,357
Yeah, check it out. I found that
canned ham that we'd had forever...

63
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,620
and I put it in a pot of boiling water.

64
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,423
- And guess what I'm calling it?
- Soup?

65
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,364
Hot ham water. You know,
I'm actually a really good mom.

66
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,526
I think it's 'cause
Maeby's never around.

67
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,968
You should send George Michael
to Openings too.

68
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,040
Yes, it could help him
express his feelings.

69
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,473
My son expresses himself just fine.

70
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,137
- Isn't that right, Son?
- What? Yeah, it's fine.

71
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,373
Yeah, I guess.
I don't care. Stop.

72
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,143
Yes. He's a regular
Freddy Wilson, that one.

73
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,049
- I don't know that reference.
- No, I don't either.

74
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,055
Oh, I don't know either.

75
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,058
<i>- It's this guy.</i>
- My son's fine where he is.

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,720
He's got the S.A.T.'s coming up.
You gotta do well. You studying?

77
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,627
Yeah, I'm taking a three real quick
so I can get a cream soda.

78
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,428
- Oh, I'll get that for you.
- No, I will get it. I have to get it myself.

79
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,265
Just relax.

80
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,135
Just check the stove real quick.

81
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,404
You know, Michael, if I may
take off my acting pants for a moment...

82
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,172
and pull my "analrapist" stocking
over my head...

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,647
George Michael has been
acting strange lately.

84
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,421
He may have developed
what we in the soft sciences...

85
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,756
refer to as obsessive-compulsive disorder...

86
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,797
- or the OC Disorder.
- Don't call it that.

87
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,595
I think ultimately it's because
he's afraid to express himself.

88
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:34,139
<i>Actually, he was afraid his Aunt Lindsay
was going to burn the house down.</i>

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,107
Hi. How are you?

90
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,472
Cream soda.

91
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,051
Maybe he does need this school.
Did you see this letter?

92
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,710
You know, it's done wonders for Maeby.

93
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,220
- "Maeby is an exceptional young lady."
- Exceptional.

94
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,450
"We are sure that she is
destined for great things."

95
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,119
- Great things.
- "And we wish her luck in all her"...

96
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,626
It says "over." I'd probably have
to crack this open to be sure...

97
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,633
but this sounds like
an expulsion letter.

98
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,635
"She's never been to class."

99
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,898
What boarding school would
lose track of its students?

100
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,134
- Openings is not a boarding school.
- I thought it was a boarding school.

101
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:14,236
<i>Actually, Maeby had been on
the set of a film called</i> Snowboarding School 2...

102
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,975
<i>in her secret life
as a film executive.</i>

103
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,415
There goes that nonrefundable tuition.

104
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,419
It is the one rule they do have there.

105
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,421
She should be punished for this.

106
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,186
Tobias, if I can become a more traditional mother,
then maybe you could start being more of...

107
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,488
Nontraditional mother.
Yes, you're right.

108
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,495
After all, I am her father.

109
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,065
The cars are still off,
and I rewashed all the clothes.

110
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,158
<i>And that's when Michael decided...</i>

111
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,000
<i>that perhaps Maeby's tuition
didn't have to go to waste after all.</i>

112
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,336
<i>Meanwhile, Lucille went to work...</i>

113
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,673
<i>- soliciting for the Bluth fund-raiser.</i>
- We have plenty of money.

114
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:50,477
Don't get me wrong. But we can't use
our personal assets to defend the company.

115
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,677
<i>Just then,
Gob arrived and decided to have a laugh.</i>

116
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,778
Your drink, madam.

117
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,823
- Can I get you anything...
- Get that one out of here.

118
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,825
As you please.

119
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,521
<i>But Lucille had never
made eye contact with a waiter.</i>

120
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,427
- Can you drop these off at two?
- Why not?

121
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,399
I'm just a waiter.

122
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,767
<i>- So he kept it up.</i>
- We're all out of the halibut.

123
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,241
<i>The joke was over,
but the lunch rush was just beginning.</i>

124
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,402
- Hey, new guy. You wanna seat table four?
- Oh, yeah.

125
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,039
<i>Back at the penthouse,
however, lunch was long overdue.</i>

126
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,709
I don't suppose she left
anything for me to eat.

127
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,719
No, just a soup and a half sandwich
and a whole sandwich for me.

128
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,482
- Ah.
- Hello. Hey.

129
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,490
So what's going on
with the fund-raiser?

130
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,494
Well, uh, I don't think the Home Builder's
Organization is gonna be supporting us.

131
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,064
Yeah, the HBO is not gonna want us.
What do we do now?

132
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,623
Well, I think it's showtime. I think
we have to have a show during dinner.

133
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,930
Hey, we could have some celebrities in.

134
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,437
You know, Oscar winners
like, uh, Nicole Kidman.

135
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,440
I don't wanna round up
a bunch of famous people...

136
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,510
that have nothing to do
with our family as some stunt.

137
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,910
- What's that got to do with us?
- Nothing. You're gonna write a speech about me...

138
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,914
so they can see how wonderful I am.

139
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,007
I think we got a better
chance at Nicole Kidman.

140
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,746
- Oh? Huh?
- Actually, I may have an in with Andy Richter.

141
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,255
Well, do you think you can get him?
I'm kidding. Of course not him.

142
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,293
His brother does teach
George Michael at Openings.

143
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,693
George Michael is going to
that New Age feel-gooderie?

144
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,596
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're gonna poison him against you.

145
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,191
Remember what happened
when we sent Lindsay to that kind of school?

146
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,101
All of a sudden I was
the-the bad guy to her.

147
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,573
And you don't respect Mom,
and you don't respect women.

148
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,775
- Are you married?
- Damn school.

149
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,611
I said to the teacher...
I said, "You poison her, I'll poison you."

150
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,117
<i>George Sr. did more than just say it.</i>

151
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,018
<i>He sent the man a basket
of poison muffins.</i>

152
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,025
Do you know the Muffin Man?
There's a reward if you do.

153
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,095
Then, would you like some foam
in your coffee?

154
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:47,496
It's called a "cuppuccino,"
and wait till you see what it costs.

155
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,330
You can say what you want
about the Milford Academy.

156
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,167
The kids who came out of there,
prepared for life.

157
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,968
Does anyone know how
to eat one of these?

158
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,975
You know, George Michael's
gonna be fine, okay?

159
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,910
I just want him to know how to express himself.

160
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,811
<i>He was actually
having trouble expressing himself.</i>

161
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,816
Why don't you tell the group
about yourself?

162
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,512
My name is George Michael Bluth.

163
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,089
I am a 16-year-old Caucasian male.

164
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,522
My mom died.

165
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,356
And I-I guess that's it.

166
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,862
Hardly. See, if it were me, I would say...

167
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,299
"I'm Donnie Richter. I have a brother named Andy.
He's an attention hog.

168
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,896
He can't seem to really attract a real audience,
but I love the fat SOB anyway."

169
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,840
I thought you looked like Andy Richter.
You guys are identical twins?

170
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,843
Identical quintuplets, actually.

171
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,278
<i>There was Andy the show-off,
Donnie the sensitive one...</i>

172
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,512
<i>Chareth the flirt,
Rocky the risk-taker and Andy's stunt double...</i>

173
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,714
<i>and Emmett who asked that
we not show his picture...</i>

174
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,554
<i>although composite photography tells us
he'd look something like this.</i>

175
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,128
<i>Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to go home tonight...</i>

176
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,697
and write something about
how you really feel.

177
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,892
Something critical. Bring it in tomorrow
and read it for the group.

178
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,063
- Um, will this go toward my grade?
- Oh, we don't have grades here.

179
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:05,041
A student either learns and gets an "L,"
or they fluctuate in their learning.

180
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,442
- And what do we get for that?
- An "F."

181
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,538
<i>- Maeby, meanwhile...</i>

182
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,640
<i>- was about to have a learning experience.</i>
- Well.

183
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,414
I understand you've been having trouble
with that expensive boarding school.

184
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,421
That's right. I can read.

185
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,548
Okay, first of all,
<i>Variety</i> got it wrong, all right?

186
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,889
We didn't want this project.
It was a co-finance with Miramax.

187
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,121
Poof, Miramax is gone.
We're still on the hook.

188
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,130
It turns out Jamie Kennedy
can't even snowboard.

189
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,326
All right, I'll listen to this later.

190
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,804
Don't tell me where you've been.
It'll just make me worry more. But guess what.

191
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,898
There's a new daddy in town.

192
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,909
A discipline daddy.

193
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,338
Oh, it's, uh... It's a parenting tape.

194
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,577
If you wanna skip school, that's fine.
You'll just come to work with me.

195
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,586
But you don't have a job.

196
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,156
All right. Here.
Tell you what we're gonna do.

197
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,784
We are going to stuff each one
of these gift bags with...

198
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:59,763
a head shot, some glitter
and a decorative hand soap.

199
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,425
And we're gonna send 'em to
every casting director in town.

200
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,437
- And don't forget the funny notes.
- "I know where you live. Ha, ha"?

201
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,702
- Casting directors hate this.
<i>- They really do.</i>

202
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,868
The glitter queen struck again.

203
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,640
Never hire Tobias Fünke.

204
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,148
<i>And back at the country club,
something unusual had happened.</i>

205
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,710
Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale. Unless,
did you expect me to follow you to your car?

206
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,017
- They're your tips.
- Tips.

207
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:30,391
<i>And Gob realized
he'd accidentally worked a day in his life.</i>

208
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,396
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,
was being a mother...</i>

209
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,557
<i>- when someone showed up who needed one.</i>
- Hey, sister.

210
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,760
- How'd you get here?
- I walked.

211
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,633
I tried hitchhiking,
but it's hard to do without a thumb.

212
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,835
- I'm so hungry.
- Would you like to try some of this?

213
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,309
Mmm.

214
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,143
So watery, and yet there's
a smack of ham to it.

215
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,308
It's hot ham water.

216
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,751
- Yeah. <i>- Upstairs, George Michael
was struggling with his assignment.</i>

217
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,814
- Can you think of anything critical
to say about my dad? - Are you serious?

218
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,224
I have glitter in my lungs from
making goody bags for casting directors.

219
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,320
And he's given me a hundred more
to do for homework.

220
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,026
It's, like, "I don't do my homework.
George Michael does my homework."

221
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,036
<i>And that's when he decided
it was time to cheat off of her.</i>

222
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,038
It might help if
you expressed yourself.

223
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,043
<i>It also gave him an opportunity
to smell her neck.</i>

224
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,045
<i>And the next day,
Michael drove to Openings...</i>

225
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,173
<i>in the hopes of recruiting
Donnie's brother for the fund-raiser...</i>

226
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,775
<i>when he noticed his son
expressing himself rather well.</i>

227
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,983
He pretends he's the great father all of a sudden
and acts like he's all worried about me.

228
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,788
But it turns out he just does it
so I can help him with his joke of a career.

229
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,022
No wonder Mom
wanted out so bad.

230
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,065
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

231
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,536
<i>Gob, meanwhile, was several days
in to being an accidental waiter.</i>

232
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,937
<i>And he discovered that
a little flirting helped bring in the tips.</i>

233
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,704
If you didn't have adult-onset diabetes,
I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar.

234
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:57,875
Oh, Gob. You could charm
the black off a telegram boy.

235
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,543
<i>Okay, we'll just tell you now.
She's the one who dies.</i>

236
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,383
His name is Andy something.

237
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,890
I think he's Ed McMahon's kid.
A song and dance man.

238
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,228
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was there soliciting for the fund-raiser...</i>

239
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,422
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was there soliciting for the fund-raiser...</i>

240
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,726
<i>- but still hadn't noticed him.</i>
- We'll have the lobster tail.

241
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,165
<i>- Until this happened.</i>
- And maybe later you can...

242
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,396
save a little piece of tail for me.

243
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,405
Come on!

244
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,443
<i>I hope that isn't the sort of humor
Andy McMahon will be doing.</i>

245
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,569
Lobster, Mom?

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,739
<i>- And Michael went to confront Donnie.</i>
- Hey!

247
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,818
<i>Nice haircut and thanks
for turning my son against me.</i>

248
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,011
Oh, oh. No, no. I-I'm Andy.

249
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,521
Oh. Sorry.

250
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,751
Oh, hey. How would you feel about
coming to a fund-raiser at our house?

251
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,420
- How much does it pay?
- It's just a free dinner, but...

252
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,429
- I'll be there.
- Great.

253
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,932
- I'll be in the cafeteria.
- Oh, he's such a pig.

254
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,195
You should know about
bad-mouthing family members.

255
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,203
I heard what you had
my son say out there.

256
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,273
He chose what to say.

257
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,138
- Maybe we should include him in this.
- No need.

258
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,441
You're the one that poisoned him against me.
How would you like that done to you?

259
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,038
Are you threatening to poison me?

260
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,177
I'm just expressing myself, man.

261
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,280
- What did I tell you?
- How dare that Donnie Richter.

262
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,986
Yeah, you gotta take care
of that guy, or I will.

263
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,620
- Yeah, yeah. Let me.
- This is not your business. No.

264
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,631
I'm just gonna pull him
out of that school.

265
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,725
You're damn right, you are.
We can't have this happen. Not now.

266
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,532
This family has got to stick together.

267
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,539
I don't want Gob coming to this dinner.

268
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,201
- Good idea.
- Guess where he's been getting his money.

269
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,244
Is he following people
to their cars again?

270
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,836
He's a waiter!

271
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,143
- He is? Well, that's great.
- No, it's not great.

272
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,343
Am I the only one that
thinks this family...

273
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,443
is finally starting to become
sympathetic and relatable?

274
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,456
That's what people wanna see, you know.
Lindsay's taking care of the house.

275
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,822
Oh, I forgot about that.

276
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,919
Tell the "housewife"
she's not coming either.

277
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,158
If you don't want her, you don't want me either.
She's taking care of me.

278
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,099
She glued my thumb back on.

279
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,661
Sister's my new mother, Mother.
And is it just me, or is she looking hotter too?

280
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,003
- Why don't you marry her?
- Maybe I will!

281
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,770
We're veering away
from relatability again.

282
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,745
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was
getting tired of being with her father.</i>

283
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,612
Now what we do is we paint our lips
Joan Crawford red...

284
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,676
pop on a little blue eyeliner and then
plant a lipstick kiss on every one of 'em.

285
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,383
- Why the blue eyeliner? - Well, she felt
that her eyes were too close together.

286
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,187
Hello? Uh, yeah, uh...

287
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,786
It's a casting director.
Yes, he is available.

288
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,959
Uh, let me put my, uh...
our, uh, assistant on the phone with you.

289
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,470
Thank you, yes. I better get changed.

290
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,597
Thanks, Deb. Yeah.

291
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,869
So, he's Torture Victim
Number Four, right?

292
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,377
No, that's great.
Yeah, he's really into discipline.

293
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,141
<i>And George Michael
was about to get some discipline too.</i>

294
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,149
You are no longer
going to that school.

295
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,448
I don't wanna get into a big discussion about it.
It's just not right for you.

296
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,318
Is this because I cheated off Maeby?
I've never done that before. I swear.

297
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,620
I couldn't think of anything about you,
so I asked her to write it about her dad.

298
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,992
- You cheated?
- Yeah, it was stupid of me.

299
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,227
Now Donnie's met you. He's never gonna
believe you were up for a part in <i>Wicked.</i>

300
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,293
You do what you have to. You think I want to give
that speech about Dad at the fund-raiser?

301
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,842
Sometimes you say you hate your dad to get
a good grade or you like him to make some money.

302
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,605
Sounds like you're doing a great job there.
We're keeping you in.

303
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,907
- No...
- I don't wanna have a whole discussion about it.

304
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,748
Donnie. Well, I guess
I owe you an apology.

305
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,413
No.

306
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,753
- It's Andy again, isn't it?
- Rocky. Andy's the pig.

307
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,327
- Well, you're not exactly...
- I'm his stunt double.

308
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,919
You think I like this?
I disgust myself.

309
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,760
Let go of my dad.
You're gonna hurt him.

310
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,927
Oh, no. I'm only making it look like that.
He's totally in charge of the situation.

311
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,441
So what is the problem?

312
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,604
Somebody sent my brother Donnie
a basket of poison muffins.

313
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,773
It could've been the Muffin Man.
They never caught him.

314
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,717
- How do you know about that?
- I saw it on <i>Why We Were Scared of the '70s.</i>

315
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,550
And what ever happened to the Muffin Man?
Remember him?

316
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,284
I always pictured a giant six-foot muffin...

317
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,292
trying to eat me while I was eatin' him.

318
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,794
It's kind of a fantasy
I go to a lot now.

319
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,798
And he says <i>you</i> threatened to poison him.

320
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,800
I was upset.

321
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,531
I'd just heard that my son thought I was
a horrible father. But, no, I didn't poison him.

322
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,573
Well, if I find out you did...

323
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,377
Oh, uh, Andy wants to know,
at this dinner...

324
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,311
- you want him to sing or anything?
- A song would be fantastic.

325
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,216
You saw? I thought you didn't know
what I said about you.

326
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,219
Well, that wasn't exactly the truth.

327
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,846
But don't worry. I know you don't
have anything bad to say about me.

328
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,518
No. You know what? I think Donnie was right.
I just wasn't digging deep enough.

329
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,993
I think I might've meant what I said.
You never listen to me.

330
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,430
You didn't ask me if I wanted to go to this school.
You didn't ask about what I said.

331
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,593
You threatened my teacher.
You don't respect me.

332
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,830
How can I respect you, man?

333
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,203
<i>It was a complex situation...</i>

334
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,208
<i>without an easy solution.</i>

335
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,677
- Hello?
- The caterers didn't show up. I used the club.

336
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,681
They said we owe them too much money.
I guess all those lunches.

337
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:03,346
I've got 50 people coming in three hours
and nothing to feed them, no one to serve it.

338
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,856
We have to make a good impression,
or we're finished.

339
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,928
<i>Now that's a clear-cut situation
with the promise of comedy.</i>

340
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,520
<i>Tell your friends.</i>

341
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,627
<i>The Save Our Bluths party
was starting to heat up.</i>

342
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,569
<i>But the same could not be said
for Lindsay's chicken.</i>

343
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,614
What is going on?
They're getting restless.

344
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,616
I can't offer to!@%$ them
in front of their husbands.

345
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,879
This is what you're making?
Poached salmonella?

346
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,455
It'll be fine.
I'll just put the sauce on them.

347
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,456
What kind of sauce is that?

348
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,458
Wait. This is the water
I thawed the chicken in.

349
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,391
Oh. Well, that should go with chicken.

350
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,089
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

351
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,098
<i>And some powerful players showed up.</i>

352
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,259
George, Bill Kincade
from Fostco Industries.

353
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,896
<i>- Sort of.</i> - Hope you don't mind.
I sent one of those stupid surrogates.

354
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,668
- You got busted too?
- No, I had a prior engagement.

355
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,939
- I'm at the Fire and Ice Ball.
- Coming through. Chicken in chicken sauce.

356
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,946
Thank you very much for showing up.

357
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,278
Maybe you could sing while
they're bringing out dinners.

358
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,619
Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmett.

359
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,246
Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmett.

360
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,323
Andy sent me over to let you know
he's not gonna make it tonight.

361
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,188
<i>Michael was suspicious.
I mean, think about it.</i>

362
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,762
<i>We can't show Emmett
without blurring him.</i>

363
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,629
Yeah, he's singing at
the Fire and Ice Ball tonight.

364
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,531
Andy Richter is singing
at the Fire and Ice Ball?

365
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:29,096
You know, I should send Andy
a little basket of poison muffins too.

366
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,108
Muffins?

367
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,179
Oh, my God. Dad?
You're the Muffin Man?

368
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,146
You poisoned 25 teachers
during the '70s?

369
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,183
Just the first two.
The others were copycats.

370
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,014
- You poisoned Donnie, didn't you?
- We're losing them. Come on. Come on.

371
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,716
Can I have your attention?
My son would like to say...

372
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,883
just a couple of words about me.

373
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,019
<i>And that's when Michael
noticed his own son.</i>

374
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,223
- You came, huh?
- Yeah, well, it was wrong of me...

375
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,823
to say what I did
about how I felt.

376
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,461
No, you said what you felt, and maybe
it's about time I did the same thing.

377
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,200
So why don't we just let him express himself?
Go ahead, Son.

378
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:08,405
Um, I was going to say that you don't know
who my father really is.

379
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,575
And-And-And that what has happened to us
is a great injustice...

380
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,152
that we were never really
given a fair chance.

381
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,553
But that's not the truth.

382
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,591
We've been given
plenty of chances.

383
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,490
And maybe, the Bluths
just aren't worth saving.

384
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,826
Maybe we're not that likable. You know?
We're very self-centered.

385
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,594
And my father may be the worst of us.

386
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,692
Me too. You know, I-I seem to...

387
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,400
I threaten people who I don't feel support me.

388
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:39,168
He poisons them.
Anyway, here's my advice to you.

389
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,042
Go and take a goody bag
and get out while you can.

390
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,781
<i>The speech was disturbing, the food inedible...</i>

391
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,117
<i>and the gift bags pretty frightening.</i>

392
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,350
<i>And when Gob realized
he wouldn't get tipped...</i>

393
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,517
Wait. No. No.
Where's everyone going?

394
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,117
<i>The service got a little worse.</i>

395
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,426
No one's leaving until I get my money!
I'll follow you to your cars!

396
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,263
<i>Oh, and then that
old racist woman choked on Buster's thumb.</i>

397
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,200
- My thumb! My thumb!
- This lady can't breathe.

398
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,933
<i>All in all, it was one
of the Bluths' better dinner parties.</i>

399
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,078
- Hey, what'd you think of the speech?
- You'd do great at Openings.

400
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,842
You know, pal,
you do not have to go there.

401
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,614
I've been very worried about your behavior.
You're always turning off burners and irons...

402
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,714
and it may be OCD.

403
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,625
OCD? No. I'm just cleaning up after Aunt Lindsay.
She never turns things off.

404
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,629
Wow. Hmm.

405
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,858
Explains why I saw hedge trimmers
zippin' around the driveway.

406
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,162
I did it again, didn't I?
I'm so self-centered.

407
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,432
From now on, I want you to just tell me
what's on your mind, okay?

408
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:45,306
And I promise, you know,
I won't just hear what I wanna hear, okay?

409
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,548
- I love my cousin.
- I love you, too, pal.

410
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,113
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

411
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,985
<i>The Bluth family gets some good news.</i>

412
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,492
They're all sending in donations.
And you know what the key was?

413
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,324
- What?
- Your speech. It didn't sound desperate.

414
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,194
Well, I-I guess it really doesn't pay
to be desperate.

415
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,860
It sure doesn't.

416
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,802
<i>And cut.</i>

417
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,805
Good job, man.

418
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,535
Let's not celebrate yet.
We've still got the West Coast feed, guys.

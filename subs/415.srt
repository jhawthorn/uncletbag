- Wait, I bet we're sitting</i>

3
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:07,886
in the exact same traffic.

4
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,388
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

5

8
00:00:17,353 --> 00:00:19,731
Loving that kid too much and
letting him fly the plane.

9
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:21,358
And... and you know what? One more thing.

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,443
I think I accidentally had
the phone flipped around.

11
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:26,197
I recorded my face the
whole time, you know?

12

Smartphone, stupid man.

13
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,658
Pal, why don't you loop
around and film this thing.

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,118
Someone's got to tell the story.

GEORGE MICHAEL: Missed you again, damn.

19
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,086
But, you know, I got out of my car here,

20
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,172

here now with a paramedic

21

22
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:45,966
Can I record some video over there?

23
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:47,718
- No cameras allowed.
- No camera... 

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,511
They're being real tight-assed
about this camera thing.

25

proving more adept at lying</i>

get off the phone sometimes.

I thought you were having
dinner with your dad.

some birth control in me

that I paid for myself,

110
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:00,869

111
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,454
Well, that's perfect,

112
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,332

ready to have children.

- Hey, Dad.
- George Michael, hey.

116

Got out of it.

117
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,842
I just... I made a ton of people angry,

118
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:17,802
but you know what I always say: family... 

119
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:20,805
Well, aw, gosh, you know, I
really wanted to, uh, do that,

120
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,641
but I just had this work thing come up.

121
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,143
And, uh, it's like you always say:

122
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,312
family first, unless there's a work thing,

123
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,314
and then work first.

124
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,316
I have said that, too.

125
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,818

- Okay.

What did you do with my stuff?

131
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,662
- I've just got a girl coming over and... 
- Maeby?

132
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,457
It's not Maeby, no. But,
um, could you please leave?

133
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:48,208
Okay, first you "F" me with Fakeblock,

134
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,834
and then you're gonna kick me out

135
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,336
when you have a hottie coming over?

136
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,712
- I have roommate rights.
- Well, you know what?

137
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,756
You voided your rights when you took

138
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:56,425
this picture of Maeby brushing her teeth.

139
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,343
- Not against the rules.
- Still a little weird,

140
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:59,511
- don't you think?
- But not against the rules.

141
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,554
- Well... 
- You know what?

142
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,306
This is no longer a peace pizza.

143
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,848
- That is a war pizza.
- Okay, that's fine.

144
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,725
Do you want to take it back or... ?

145
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:08,103
No, I already ate. Th... that's for you.

146
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:09,687
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

147
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,482

00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,863
Oh, so this is a dorm.

151
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:20,073
This is a dorm.

152
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,243
Well, I suppose anything goes in a dorm.

153
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:26,204
You got that right.

154
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:28,624
Although, we should probably go inside,

155
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:30,000
because they don't like us

156

160

impresses me about you?

162
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:48,018

00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,062
Well, I aim to not please. (chuckles)

164

Oh, my God, they sound
like terrible people.

167
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,822
- Oh, they were.
- Huh.

168
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:03,116

you conceived Fakeblock?

169

00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,748
<i>On the other hand, she thought</i>

172
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,293
<i>he was an unpretentious software genius.</i>

173
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:17,464
<i>If she were to learn that he
was merely a wood block player</i>

174
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,133
<i>with a heightened ability
to track the passage of time,</i>

175
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:21,677
<i>perhaps she would rightly feel</i>

176
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:24,513
<i>lack of pretention should be a given.</i>

177
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:28,684
<i>It was after second 23 that he said... </i>

178
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:31,687
24. Yes, it was, uh, right in here.

179
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,313
- Wow.
- Yeah.

180
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:35,399
This is like making love
with the Wright brothers

181
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,108
in their bicycle shop.

182
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,027
<i>I'm sure she just meant one of them.</i>

183
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,112
<i>Hey, how about her knowing
they had a bicycle shop?</i>

184
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:42,864
Just a little token... 

185
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:45,283
<i>The next morning, he walked her to her car.</i>

186
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:48,579
(sighs) Listen, I got to go shoot a PSA.

187
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,996
I'll text you from the car.

188
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:51,915
Oh, no, don't... don't do... 

189
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:53,458
- Action.
- Tweet and drive.

190
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,835
Yeah, that was good, but it's "text."

191
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,588
And we need the word "don't."

192
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,590
<i>And upon returning to his dorm,</i>

193
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:03,134
<i>he discovered that P-Hound had
officially filed a grievance</i>

194
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,678
<i>with the student housing office.</i>

195
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,055
DOUG: So P-Hound claims
that George Michael... 

196
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,140
Make a note of that; that's one person.

197
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:10,225
Oh, I know, I know.

198
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,809
Messed with his stuff

199
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:13,770
and stole some software thing?

200
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:15,772
Yeah, and, uh, George Michael claims

201
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,649
that nobody can live with P-Hound.

202
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,443
Somebody's got to go.

203
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:20,777
O... okay, it's time for a vote.

204
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,446
We'll each get one vote.

205
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,322
Oh, well, that doesn't really seem fair,

206
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:26,116
because you guys are obviously
gonna vote for the same person.

207
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,702
Oh, right, yeah, 'cause, uh, we're twins,

208
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:31,079
and, uh, we have no sense
of ourselves as individuals.

209
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,080
That's right.

210
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:33,248
BOTH: Fine.

211
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,125
We'll each get a half vote.

212
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,210
<i>And the four men cast their three votes.</i>

213
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:39,045
DOUG: It's a tie.

214
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,506
Uh, one and a half to one and a half.

215
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,425
<i>The twins were proud to show that they</i>

216
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:44,926
<i>voted differently from one another.</i>

217
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:48,012
Eh, we're gonna need a tiebreaker, ugly.

218
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,181
<i>Fortunately, they were able to bring in</i>

219
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,642
<i>two more half voters... </i>

220
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:53,769
<i>- It's a tie. Two to two.
- ... who also proved</i>

221
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,520
<i>they were capable of
having opposite opinions.</i>

222
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,230
Double tie!

223
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:58,898
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah! Whoo!

224
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,942
<i>To break the tie, more members of twin club</i>

225
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:02,235
<i>joined the electorate... </i>

226
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,237
a quadruple tie!

227
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,947
<i>Which also jammed up the works.</i>

228
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,366
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Go, yeah.

229
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:11,035
Maybe we should just bring
in a single person now.

230
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,913
Uh, you mean like n... not a twin?

231
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,332
Yeah, just to speed things along a little.

232
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,083
<i>And perhaps it was that comment... </i>

233
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,752
I guess one head's better
than two, huh? Twin hater.

234
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,462
We've been dealing with
"twincists" like you

235
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:22,714
all our lives.

236
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:25,592
<i>That united the voting body
into a greater cause than</i>

237
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:26,926
<i>expressing their individuality.</i>

238
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:29,095
<i>And with the exception</i>

239
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,514
<i>of George Michael's vote... </i>

240
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:31,973
P-Hound.

241
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:35,352
George Michael. George
Michael. George Michael.

242
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:36,520
George Michael. George Michael.

243
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,896
<i>- ... and one other curiosity... 
- George Michael.</i>

244

<i>Bender fromFuturama.</i>

00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,068
<i>it was a George Michael blitz.</i>

247
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,862
DOUG: (sighs) George Michael and... 

248
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,948
oh, a half vote for "George
Michael the twincist."

249
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,992
See you later, twin hater.

250
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,369
- No, I'm not... 
- Uh, uh.

251
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,663
(whispers): Shh. Go.

252
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:57,081
<i>And now wishing he'd
actually packed the bag</i>

253
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,543
<i>- I... 
- OTHERS: Shh.
- George Michael aimlessly</i>

254
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,586
<i>headed out onto the campus
where, as fate would have it,</i>

255
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:04,047
<i>- (horn honks) Oh!
- He ran into his beeping uncle.</i>

256
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,423
(bleep) What are you doing here?

257
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:07,175
I was in the neighborhood.

258
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:09,636
I happened to remember
how much you love bologna.

259
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,596
- Huh?
- So, yeah, I just... I found this great shop-rite

260
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,348
and I just thought, you
know who's got to have

261
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,517
a taste of this, is young George Michael.

262
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,352
<i>He didn't think George
Michael liked bologna.</i>

263
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:19,187
I know how you love bologna.

264
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,981
<i>He was trying to correct
a bad impression he felt</i>

265
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:24,651
<i>he might have made with his
nephew a few nights earlier.</i>

266
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:25,736
We're good.

267
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,404
My God, Uncle Gob, what is this?

268
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:28,613
Can't lie to you, George Michael,

269
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:29,906
it's a forget-me-now.

270
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,868
I wanted you to forget what happened

271
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,370
at that magic club; I was embarrassed.

272
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:39,165
If you don't want me to tell
anyone about it, I won't.

273
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:40,333
I'm such a fool.

274
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,502
I go to those things too quickly.

275
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:44,337
Really, it's just the
age we live in, isn't it?

276
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,840
Take a pill to forget your problems.

277
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:48,633
Take a pill to go to sleep.

278
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,844
And take a pill to forget your problems.

279
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,429
Need an erection, take a pill.

280
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,097
Need to forget your problems, take a pill.

281
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:56,307
Take a pill and your
problems are forgotten.

282
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:57,392
Just take a pill.

283
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:58,518
What an age we live in.

284
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,728
It's great, isn't it? (laughs)

285
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,272
What's with the suitcase?

286
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:04,274
I got kicked out of my dorm.

287
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:07,068
That was a freebie.

288
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,695
You in the market to buy a house?

289
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,196
It's a great time to buy.

290
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:11,615
Oh, I don't want to buy a house.

291
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,032
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Money?

292
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,325
(chuckles): Ninja please.

293
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,702
You don't need money.

294
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,078
With that Fakeblock thing you got going

295
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,329
and your great credit rating,

296
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:19,956
we can put you in a Bluth in no time.

297
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,375
<i>Frankly, it wasn't the kind of risk</i>

298
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,210
<i>George Michael would take.</i>

299
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:27,046
<i>But then Gob said something
that changed his mind.</i>

300
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,840
Plus, it would make your dad proud.

301
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:31,468
I know that he's still
really disappointed about

302
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:32,844
you, uh... 

303
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,137
What, that I blew him off?

304
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,931
Blew him off.

305
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,974
Boy, is he disappointed about that.

306
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:39,225
I would love to say yes... 

307
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,184
Yes! There it is!

308
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:42,353
I got my much vaunted yes!

309
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,688
<i>Gob felt good.</i>

310
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,482
<i>He would be able to prove</i>

311
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:48,777
<i>to his brother that he
could actually sell a house.</i>

312
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,070
<i>George Michael felt good
because he could prove</i>

313
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,448
<i>to his father that he
did indeed support him.</i>

314
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,534
<i>And the residents of
Sudden Valley felt good,</i>

315
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:59,245
<i>because it turns out,
the very young-looking man</i>

316
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,122
<i>- who drove down their street
- Hi.</i>

317
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,249
<i>- That afternoon... 
- Oh, hello, young man.
- Hi.</i>

318
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,793
How young are you?

319
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,169
I'm good. How you doing?

320
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,504
No, how young are you?

321
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,631
Oh, I... I'm 22. 22 years... 

322
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,132
<i>- ... was over 21,
- 22? You look 16.</i>

323
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,634
<i>And they wouldn't have to search</i>

324
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:14,344
<i>for a home that was even more remote.</i>

325
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:18,306
He's 22! He's 22, but looks 16.

Oh, this is...

00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,578
(chuckles) I wonder who this is from.

337
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,747
- We said no clothes, Carlos.
- Hat is not clothes.

338
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,165
- A hat is clothes.
- Gosh, I wish

339
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:45,792
I had something to offer you guys.

340

00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:52,047
You know, feels like it
should be the other way around.

343
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,424
(laughter)

344
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,885
<i>MAN: Football!</i>

345
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,469
Hut, hut.

346
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,804
- (Carlos laughs)
- Carlos... 

347
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:58,889
Carlos, you're on my team.

348
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,181
You're on my team.

349
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,017
The play is dead. The play is dead.

350
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,977
The ball touched the ground.

351
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,812
Come on. The play is dead.

352
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,772
Carlos, man, we're on the same team.

353
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,149
Guys, maybe-maybe we can't
play skins versus skins.

354
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,609
Tops versus bottoms?

355
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,319
I got to bring my girlfriend up here.

356
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,821
- She's gonna love it.
- Let's throw her a party,

357
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,948
Sudden Valley style.

358
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,827
That actually sounds... Yeah, fun.

359
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:23,955
<i>And so George Michael
was proud to invite Rebel</i>

360
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:28,001
<i>to see how successful
George Maharis had become</i>

361
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,294
<i>and how many people were
eager to be in his company.</i>

362
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,214
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. He
was tickling me in there.

363
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:35,592
- Hey, um, what... what is all this?
- Hey. Just a little surprise.

364
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,010
<i>- You did this for me?
- Yes.
- But Rebel had</i>

365
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,012
<i>- other concerns.
- We need to talk.</i>

366
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:41,973
ALL: Ooh.

367
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,182
This is it.

368
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,851
This is the place.

369
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:47,478
Hope you don't find it too pretentious.

370
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,899
Well, what happened to the
old anything goes in the dorm?

371
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,191
Well, I got this place instead.

372
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,777
You know, I guess I wanted to impress you.

373
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,737
I'm gonna get some furniture, obviously.

374
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,655
- Right.
- The guys from home
fill are coming this week.

375
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,114
That's not the problem.

376
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:00,992
- No, that's not the problem.
- (Door opens)

377
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,118
Wrong house, buddy.

378
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,287
No, this is my son,

379
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,747
Lem Depardieu.

380
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,248
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

381
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,750
Jacqueline still in the car?

382
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,251
(exhales) Oh, you have a son?

383
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:11,878
Yeah.

384
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,671
- Hey, Lem. How you doing?
- Hi.

385
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:15,048
I love kids. I'm great... 
You want a Twister?

386
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,173
I was just given, like, four Twisters.

387
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:17,759
- You should take one.
- Wow.

388
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,719
- Go on, take a Twister.
- Oh. You know what, honey?

389
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,513
Do you want to give Mommy some
alone time with her friend?

390
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:25,058
Maybe he could go play in the pool.

391
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,060
- Yeah.
- He'll be totally safe.
There's like 100 guys out there.

392
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:28,227
- Yay!
- Make sure you wear your sunblock.

393
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,604
<i>In fact, it was the folks</i>

394
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,146
<i>in the pool who were more at risk</i>

395
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:33,858
<i>of being near Lem than he was of them.</i>

396
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,075
<i>And perhaps that's what led Gob</i>

397
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,702
<i>to having to take out another ad.</i>

398
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:47,914
GEORGE MICHAEL: Wow, what a great kid.

399
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,332
You know, when I said I was

400
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,959
not eager to have kids,

401
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,086
but I think it's great that you have a son.

402
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,838
You know, I have a spare room here

403
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,255
that the two of you could stay in.

404
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:57,674
Or maybe you could just stay in it.

405
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,134
He doesn't live with me.

406
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:01,136
He lives in France with his father.

407
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:03,763
He just visits March and April
during French pilot season,

408
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:05,598
but that's what I'm talking about.

409
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,642
I just don't want to get that serious.

410
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,560
Because you're seeing someone else?

411
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:11,228
No. I mean, yes.

412
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,856
I'm seeing someone else, but I don't want

413
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:14,107
to get serious with him, either,

414
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,692
and you're out telling people

415
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:16,776
in the neighborhood

416
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,111
that we're seeing each other.

417
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,195
What happened to the guy

418
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,571
who founded Fakeblock?

419
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:21,948
The guy who keeps things anonymous?

420
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,324
I can do anonymous.

421
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,784
You know, I'm all about staying anonymous.

422
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:26,703
That's Fakeblock's mission statement.

423
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:29,039
And then you're asking Lem
and me to move into this house,

424
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,124
and it just, it seems all backwards.

425
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,583
(sighs)

426
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,127
Sorry.

427
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:36,171
(door closes)

428
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:38,297
Maybe it is backwards.

429
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,134
<i>George Michael shared
his relationship problem</i>

430
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,469
<i>with the one other woman</i>

431
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,388
<i>he'd had a relationship problem with.</i>

432
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,015
<i>GEORGE MICHAEL: Well, she's
not really my girlfriend.</i>

433
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:49,100
I mean, I'm crazy about her,

434
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:50,977
but she wants to keep things anonymous,

435
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:52,937
- and I don't know how to do that.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

436
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,689
- Right.
- You haven't told her
your real name yet, have you?

437
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:56,107
What? No, no.

438
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,984
No, she still thinks I'm George Maharis,

439
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:00,695
but she's dating another
guy, which is probably

440
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:03,614
the whole reason she's always
saying I'm moving too fast.

441
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,533
I take things too seriously.

442
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:08,161
I take things too serious.

443
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:09,537
I take things too seriously.

444
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:10,872
I need to note which
one of those is correct,

445
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:12,749
because I sound like a horse's ass

446
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,667
when I alternate between the two of them.

447
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,293
I need to get my (bleep) together.

448
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,504
- Yeah.
- But the point is that I take things

449
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:21,007
easily-breezily.

450
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,926
Well, a real "serioush" woman

451
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,595
knows what she wants and moves quickly.

452
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,805
"Serioush" is nothing. That's not a word.

453
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,265
Are you ready to see your office?

454
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:30,433
I have been; it's great.

455
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:31,684
I like it a lot. It... 

456
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:33,644
I wonder if she's gonna think

457
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:35,146
we've been a little lavish with money.

458
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,439
You know, is it too much?

459
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,481
But then to contradict myself,

460
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,733
I do think at some point,

461
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,568
it would be good to get a second chair

462
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,112
just in case we have a guest,
but I'm thinking big picture.

463
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:43,320
<i>Of course, that wasn't his office.</i>

464
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,281
This isn't your office.

465
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:47,033
She's over here.

466
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:49,911
<i>And it was at his actual desk</i>

467
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:52,622
<i>where he made his first
major decision as CEO.</i>

468
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:56,167
- Maeby, you're fired!
- (Tires screech)

469
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,460
<i>And although Mort was prepared</i>

470
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,378
<i>to be handed his walking papers,</i>

471
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,422
<i>there was nothing that could
have prepared George Michael</i>

472
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:05,093
<i>for what Mort would leave on his desk.</i>

473
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:06,928
<i>And so, later that day, Hey. Hey.</i>

474
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,139
<i>It was a disgruntled Maeby
that ran into Michael-Hey.</i>

475
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,682
<i>As he was seeking a
signature for his movie.</i>

476
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:14,351
I think movies are dead.
Maybe it's a TV show.

477
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:16,020
What? No. This girl that I'm dating, Rebel,

478
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,397
she's gonna be in it,
and she would never do TV.

479
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,483
You're dating Rebel Alley?

480
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:24,070
Yeah. I have a picture of us
to prove it; I can't find it,

481
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,696
- but yeah.
- So... 

482
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:27,031
you're the other guy.

483
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,532
You know her personally?

484
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:29,993
Yes. I mean,

485
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,911
that's how I know that you were dating her.

486
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:33,955
Do you know the other
guy that she's dating?

487
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:36,624
<i>And that's when she saw an opportunity</i>

488
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,168
<i>to get back at George Michael.</i>

489
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,170
No, no, but, um,

490
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:41,462
I know it's over.

491
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:42,797
She is dumping him.

492
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,090
She dumping him?

493
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:45,842
Apparently, he was coming on too strong,

494
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,468
taking it too seriously.

495
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,678
She hates that.

496
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,054
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah,

497
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,181
that's what she told me.

498
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:52,389
Just kills it for her.

499
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:53,766
She wants it easily-breezily.

500
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:57,270
Well, that's... informative.

501
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,189
I owe you. Thank you.

502
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,397
No, you don't.

503
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,816
Okay, wait,

504
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,400
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't knock, just... 

505
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,195
- Okay.
- One second.

506
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:07,071
Mm-hmm.

507
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,658
<i>And so fortified</i>

508
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,827
<i>with Maeby's information that Rebel</i>

509
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,704
<i>- was breaking up with her other beau... 
- Hello.</i>

510
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,039
<i>- Michael.
- Michael decided</i>

511
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,165
<i>- to move things along.
- I want you</i>

512
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,582
to know that I think that

513
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:19,917
I've been coming on a
little bit too strong.

514
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,211
I got a lot going on; I got the movie.

515
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:22,920
You know, a bunch of stuff

516
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,797
with the housing complex, and I'm just... 

517
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,049
I'm not gonna be pressuring you anymore.

518
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,884
I want to just keep it easy-peasy.

519
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,093
- Yeah.
- Cool, totally.

520
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,636
- Keep it loose.
- Yeah.

521
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,347
And we'll have some fun with, you know... 

522
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:34,515
If the fun, you know... 

523
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:36,684
Someday, one day, it gets more serious,

524
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:39,187
you know, then, uh, then it does,

525
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,646
and we, uh,

526
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:43,233
we're walking down the
aisle, you know, and... 

527
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,318
I'm saying it wrong, saying
it wrong, 'cause I get,

528
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,195
uh, I get tongue-tied, um... 

529
00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:49,572
uh, because I think that you

530
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:52,575
are coming on too strong.

531
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,036
- You know? Bugging me.
- Oh, uh,

532
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:56,495
you want to come in?

533
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:58,956
No.

534
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:01,834
- Ooh.
- Yeah? Yeah.

535
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:04,295
<i>It was the best sex Michael had ever had.</i>

536
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:05,922
REBEL (sighs): That was great.

537
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,965
Was that fun for you?

538
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,092
No.

539
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,301
(chuckles)

540
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,095
Are you gonna take a photo of me?

541
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,222
Uh, no.

542
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:16,974
No, no, I've been trying to get a signal.

543
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,851
<i>But he did want a picture of them together,</i>

544
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,312
<i>which I why he grabbed the one</i>

545
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:23,022
<i>he saw from the photo booth.</i>

546
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:24,232
Are you gonna call me?

547
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,775
If I'm in traffic.

548
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,777
<i>Although he was growing concerned</i>

549
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:30,280
<i>about how he was going to keep this up.</i>

short-term investments?

576
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,220
Well, you know, Gob told me that you wanted

577
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,222
to start selling these
things, not just renting them,

578
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,433
and I knew it was important to you.

579
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:41,934
He said all that, huh? Oh, boy, that was... 

580
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:43,478
That's... nice of him.

581
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,229
How... how could you afford
one of these houses, buddy.

582
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,814
Well, I have a lot of money coming in

583
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:48,691
- from investors for my software thing... 
- Okay.

584
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:51,152
And I don't know what's gonna
happen with that, so I thought

585
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:53,154
I'd do what everyone around
here says: put it into Bluth.

586
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,490
- Yeah, who else is saying that?
- You know, it's an expression.

587
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,283
- Neighbors.
- I don't like it.

588
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,493
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

589
00:19:58,534 --> 00:19:59,576
I just got two more boxes

590
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:00,995
of Twister from the neighbors.

591
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:02,913
- Oh, boy, return them.
- Feel like I have one

592
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:05,333
for every day of the week now.
Anyway, you know, I figure that

593
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,293
worse case scenario is I
sell this place, and I get

594
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:08,794
my money back. It's not like

595
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:10,254
- they're going down in value, right?
- Well... 

596
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,881
It's a great community.

597
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:13,508
- Nobody locks their doors around here.
- You should.

598
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,968
Plus, I... I wanted to make it up to you.

599
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,636
You know, I felt terrible

600
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,972
about what happened with the dorm and... 

601
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:21,598
- Wow.
- And things between us.

602
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,394
And I... I've screwed up a lot of things

603
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,270
in the past few weeks,

604
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,564
and, you know, this is the one thing

605
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,816
that I know I did right.

606
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,361
I mean, who would not want
to raise their kids here?

607
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:36,280
<i>And perhaps this is why he
didn't give him the bad news</i>

608
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,781
<i>about the neighborhood.</i>

609
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:39,450
Thank you.

610
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:43,371
Thanks, but you didn't
need to do it for me, pal.

611
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,748
<i>Now he just needed to get
out of the house before... </i>

612
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,251
You know, to be totally honest,
I didn't just do it for you.

613
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,211
- Yeah?
- I also did it for my girlfriend.

614
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:51,628
Kind of wanted to impress her.

615
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,424
<i>That came up.</i>

616
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:56,384
Wow.

617
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,552
You got a girlfriend.

618
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:59,429
Good for you. That's great.

619
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,180
Congratulations.

620
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:02,473
Your dad's got one, too.

621
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:03,599
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

622
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,142
How is yours going?

623
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:08,479
Not great.

624
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:10,689
I haven't been completely honest with her

625
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:13,025
about who I am.

626
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,694
You know, I haven't even
told her my real name,

627
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:16,946
and I don't think

628
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:19,574
I can keep that lie going, so... 

629
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:21,534
I think it might be over.

630
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,453
(sighing): Oh, great... 

631
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:28,040
pain fades slowly.

632
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:30,543
Quickly.

633
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:33,045
<i>- But now it was as simple as getting out... 
- Thanks.</i>

634
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:34,713
<i>- Before George Michael asked... 
- But what about you?</i>

635
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,382
You're doing great, huh?
Tell me about your girlfriend,

636
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,468
and you're producing this movie now.

637
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:39,635
<i>That.</i>

638
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,220
I think they're both over.

639
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:43,306
Yeah, it wasn't meant to be.

640
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,433
I'm sorry.

641
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:48,311
<i>And that's when Michael finally
treated his son like an adult.</i>

642
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:50,563
Hey, you know what I miss on you?

643
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,689
The mustache.

644
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:55,318
<i>And so, discouraged, Michael returned</i>

645
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,489
<i>to his apartment, only to find worse news.</i>

646
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,616
<i>And when he saw that Lucille 2</i>

647
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:04,285
<i>was having a campaign event at Cinco,</i>

648
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,079
<i>he knew there was only
one thing he could give her</i>

649
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:08,539
<i>instead of the money.</i>

650
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:11,417
<i>And he knew what he had to do first</i>

651
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,794
<i>to give it to her.</i>

652
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:17,214
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
had a keynote speech to give,</i>

653
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:20,510
<i>and hadn't totally decided
whether he should come clean.</i>

654
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:22,386
<i>And that's when he ran into his uncle.</i>

655
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,471
We'll take care of.

656
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:25,055
My father's got the money.

657
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:26,849
- You guys are one heck of a horde.
- Uncle Gob!

658
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,559
- No, you're mistaken, friend.
- No, it's George Michael.

659
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:30,603
- Hi. Exactly.
- Yes.

660
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,396
Hey, I'm actually really
glad I ran into you.

661
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:33,523
I could use some advice.

662
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:35,149
Oh. Love each other.

663
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:37,067
Oh, no, that's great, but I actually need

664
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:39,694
a specific piece of advice
for a certain situation.

665
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:41,572
I'll give it to you fast.

666
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:45,535
Basically, for the past few
weeks, I've been living a lie.

667
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:47,911
I've been... in this
relationship with a woman

668
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:49,788
who doesn't even know.

669
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,706

Yeah, no, she likes... 

683
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:21,862
I would say what I did take away was that

684
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:24,073
I would rather have sex with someone

685

because they thought I was someone else

686
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:29,620
than not have sex with someone
because they thought I was me.

687
00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:32,998
So I should probably do
the opposite of that and...

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,503
be true to who I am and
not compromise my integrity

689
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:40,423
just for some fleeting sexual experience.

690
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:43,593
- So, "love each other."
- There it is.

691
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,052
<i>It wasn't much help,</i>

692
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:47,430
<i>and as George Michael headed off</i>

693
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:50,974
<i>unsure of what to do, Gob
went off to find his father,</i>

694
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:53,436
<i>who was having his own relationship crisis.</i>

695
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:55,062
We're getting a real divorce.

696
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:56,689
You're out of the marriage.

697
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,775
So I am fat.

698
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:02,403
GOB: Boy, am I glad you're here.

699
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:03,987
I need money and it's
not for what you think... 

700
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:05,906
for a magic show or a bee colony... 

701
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:08,618
it's to pay the builders I hired
to start building the fake wall

702
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:09,868
between Mexico and America.

703
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,328
Shh! Are you crazy?

704
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,747
Lucille 2 is around here.

705
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,498
Well, don't worry about Lucille 2.

706
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,958
I'll handle her.

707
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:17,876
It's just that I need to pay the Chinese.

708
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:21,004
Wait, wait, you... you hired Chinese?!

709
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:23,716
Well, I figured who better than
the Chinese to build a wall.

710
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:24,883
(George Sr. stammers)

711
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,677
But, no, I couldn't afford them,

712
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:29,722
so I... I hired, um, they're
technically Mongols, I guess.

713
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:32,182
They're, well, they're the
people that they built the wall

714
00:24:32,224 --> 00:24:33,392
to try to keep out... 

715
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,602
How many did you hire?

716
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:36,228
A horde. That's the minimum.

717
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,230
They don't come in
anything less than a horde.

718
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:40,857
So you hired a Mongol horde.

719
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:44,236
Look, Dad, just, if they
don't get their money soon,

720
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:46,447
they're gonna be really mad
and then they're gonna have

721
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:47,864
a major Mongolian beef
with us... there they are.

722
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:51,118
Okay, uh, we don't have any m... money.

723
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:55,872
Well, he says that we don't have any money.

724
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:59,460
♪ ♪

725
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:03,673
<i>And at that moment, another
Bluth who had no money</i>

726
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:06,342

727
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:07,510
What are you doing?

728
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,678
I'm gonna have sex with you.

729
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,679
For money.

730
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,347
Oh!

731
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:13,182
- Oh, I didn't realize
- Yeah.

732
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:15,142
How heavy these rings are.

733
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:17,060
- Yeah.
- But I thought you were gonna kiss me

734
00:25:17,102 --> 00:25:18,270
and I panicked.

735
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,815
I... I was gonna kiss you.

736
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:25,152
I didn't even try to do it that time.

737
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,613
So, it's, uh, let's take a tumble

738
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,490
with Old Moneybags, right?

739
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:33,910
And she'll be so grateful that
she'll walk away from $700,000.

740
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,329
No, no, no, it would
absolutely not be a gift.

741
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:36,955
This would still be a loan, okay?

742
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:39,958
However, my lovemaking
would be, you know... 

743
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,460
What?

744
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:43,796
What, Michael? What were you gonna say?

745
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:47,174
Something that I would never
be able to take back, but... 

746
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:49,760
I didn't want that to happen.

747
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:50,885
Now, listen, you have been the one

748
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:52,221
that has been flirting with me.

749
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:54,348
- Those were pity flirts.
- No, they were not.

750
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,517
You want this as much as I do.

751
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,143
As much as I want this extension.

752
00:25:58,185 --> 00:25:59,687
Two different "this" es.

753
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:02,939
Now, you own a company
that I helped to build.

754
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:04,650
It was all of my hard work.

755
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:06,901
This is something you have
to do because, if you don't,

756
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:09,613
I can't be held responsible
for what I might do.

757
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,782
<i>As it turns out,</i>

758
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:14,660
<i>George Michael was the only Bluth</i>

759
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:17,371
<i>who could be responsible for what he did,</i>

760
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:19,540
<i>and as he headed to the microphone,</i>

761
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:22,793
<i>Mongols, not paid what they were promised,</i>

762
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:24,002

763
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,630
Um... Oh! Ah!

764
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,090
<i>Viva Méjico.</i>

765
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:29,592
<i>Which lead to this.</i>

766
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:32,052
(chanting): Put up this wall!

767
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:34,430
<i>And it's hard to know
whether it was the chanting</i>

768
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,930
<i>- of "Put up this wall... "
- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

769
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:38,225
if I could have your
attention for a moment... 

770
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,728
<i>or the note that promised
him a sexual resumption</i>

771
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,814
<i>of his anonymous relationship with Rebel... </i>

772
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:45,357
<i>that made him say this: </i>

773
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,570
Yeah, so, I'm George Maharis, and, uh... 

774
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:52,573
and Fakeblock is real... 

775
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:54,366
(crowd cheering, whooping)

776
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:57,494
- Let's put up this wall.
- (Chanting): Put up this wall!

777
00:26:57,536 --> 00:27:00,163
<i>But not everyone wants to
put up a wall on the Internet.</i>

778
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:02,040
Let's put up, put up this
wall. Have a good night.

779
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:07,212
<i>And the Anonymous who
left the note wasn't Rebel.</i>

780
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:13,719
<i>A discouraged Michael
returned to the model home,</i>

781
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:18,098
<i>where he ran into a brother
who also had something to hide.</i>

782
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,017
<i>As an emboldened George
Maharis gave Rebel a note</i>

783
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,688
<i>that she now believed he'd written for her.</i>

784
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,900
<i>And for the son, it
was a night to remember,</i>

785
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:30,820
<i>and for the father, a night to forget.</i>

786
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:35,115

- Shh.

787

<i>- NARRATOR: It was May 5,
- MICHAEL: Rebel, it's Michael.</i>

788

<i>And while Rebel was on the phone,</i>

789
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:41,079
<i>George Michael was realizing
that taking things casually</i>

790
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,165

791
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,959
You can come over later, okay?

792
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,376
- Good-bye.
- MICHAEL: I'll see you soon.

793
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:48,170
Who was that?

794
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:49,839
No one.

795
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,716
Look, I... I don't care.

796
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,511
I... I don't care that
you're seeing someone else.

797
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:58,555
I... I just, I want to continue this.

798
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:00,683
I'm ready to try and make this work.

799
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:03,268
I'll fight anyone I have to for you.

800
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,646
I'm not going to pretend
I don't care about you.

801
00:28:05,688 --> 00:28:07,648
I'm a grown-up man and... 

802
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,900
I want to get serious.

803
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,112
Wow. Serious.

804
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:15,781
Things are getting serious.

805
00:28:15,823 --> 00:28:17,825
<i>And the girl who was never capable</i>

806
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:19,201
<i>of making a commitment... </i>

807
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:20,744
Okay.

808

<i>Suddenly found herself making too many.</i>

809
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,123
Okay.

810
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,459
Okay.

811
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,966
<i>George Michael felt good.</i>

812
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,970
<i>And, at least for that day,</i>

813
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:41,724
<i>he wouldn't encounter his
father in Rebel's bedroom... </i>

814
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:44,018
<i>He'd run into him leaving the building.</i>

815
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,352
(laughs): Hey.

816
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:46,395
What are you doing here?

817
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:47,813
I'm vi... I'm on a visit.

818
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:49,064
I'm visiting.

819
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:50,983
My girlfriend lives here... Rebel.

820
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:54,570
Wow. So you're gonna work
it out with your girlfriend.

821
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:56,196
Good for you. That's great news.

822
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:58,323
- Great to see you again.
- That says "Rebel," huh?

823
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:02,202
Is that a... is that
a little gift for Rebel?

824
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:10,085
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

825
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,590
So there better be two
Rebels in here, am I right?

826
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:15,716
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

827
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:16,717
(both laugh)

828
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,927
That'd be weird.

829
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,887
No, ironically, she did say

830
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:20,930
that there was another guy,

831
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:22,138
but that his name was George... 

832
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,807
- ... Maharis.
- Maharis. That's me.

833
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,435
You're George Michael.

834
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:29,229
No, but, uh, yeah, but I
use the name George Maharis

835
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:32,315
when... with women, because
I hate the name George Michael.

836
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,275
I told you that.

837
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:35,235
This is, uh, this is weird.

838
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:36,779
Are you not kidding me?

839
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,155
It's insane... no... 
so, you're the other guy.

840
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:41,116
I'm the oth... well, you're the other guy.

841
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:42,492
Yeah, well, one of us.

842
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:45,412
Did I not tell you that we were alike?

843
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:46,997
Exactly alike.

844
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,374
- This is just... 
- So horrifying.

845
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,709
Too funny.

846
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:51,919
This is what I was talking about.

847
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:52,920
I told you.

848
00:29:52,962 --> 00:29:54,379
I mean, we're like twins.

849
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,589
Are we not like twins?

850
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:57,173
All the way down to the photo booth.

851
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:58,801
You name me one way in
which we're different.

852
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:01,720
Well, Dad, you know, I
never, in a million years,

853
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:03,513
would have gone out
with her, if I knew that

854
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:04,932
you were, you know, the other guy.

855
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:07,267
Me, neither.

856
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,644
I wouldn't have, either.

857
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:10,562
Damn it. You know?

858
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:11,688
You gotta believe me.

859
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,107

How'd you know about the photo booth?

How... you... 'cause you said,
"Right down to the photo... "

863
00:30:29,957 --> 00:30:32,375
I said, "Right down to the photo booth."

I am.

This isn't my house.

You're under arrest for the

Read him his rights.

Okay, I think there's
been some kind of mistake.

00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:47,010
That left hand might be difficult to cuff.

894
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:49,304
- Trouble cuffing him.
- I'm not a monster!

this time facing murder charges,

900

were there to capture it all.

Hey, did you see this?

902
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:06,696
Yeah, I saw it just now in the elevator.

903
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,031
Is this the family
you've been talking about?

904
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,074
It sure is.

905
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,533
Wow! You got the rights to this?

906
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:11,910
Well, only for the
killer... but that's enough

907
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,245

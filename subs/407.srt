<i>Hollywood Boulevard at night</i>

2
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:19,562
<i>is the playground of the hip,</i>
<i>young and successful.</i>

3
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:23,900
<i>It was into this world that</i>
<i>Gob Bluth had finally arrived,</i>

4
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,111
<i>surrounded for</i>
<i>the first time in his life</i>

5
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:27,654
<i>by a group of admirers</i>

6
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,741
<i>that comprised L.A.'s</i>
<i>latest young elite.</i>

7
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:35,703
<i>There was Mark, a pop star</i>
<i>who had a level of fame</i>

8
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,291
<i>he could neither appreciate</i>
<i>nor handle.</i>

9
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,793
<i>Trout, a Southern boy who had</i>

10
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,711
<i>a Northern man's</i>
<i>taste in women.</i>

11
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:48,175
<i>J.B.J., a weekend weatherman,</i>
<i>all-week party boy</i>

12
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,343
<i>and a huge disappointment</i>
<i>to his father.</i>

13
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,181
<i>Chris K,</i>
<i>who was a lot like Trout,</i>

14
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,183
<i>but without the accent.</i>

15
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:58,810
<i>Oakwood, a studio teacher,</i>

16
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:00,812
<i>who might have had</i>
<i>his own entourage,</i>

17
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,314
<i>if his part hadn't been cut</i>

18
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,191
<i>from the pilot of</i>
Modern Family.

19
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:07,694
<i>And, of course, there was</i>
<i>the man they called Getaway.</i>

20
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,697
<i>Gob had come far in the year</i>
<i>since his girlfriend,</i>

21
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,449
<i>was less than an hour</i>
<i>from turning 18.</i>

22
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,451
Let me run the clock down
on this thing.

23
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,163
Why don't you just go change
into something a little less...

24
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:19,914
unflattering, and... I'll, uh...

25
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:22,416
<i>And he was getting everyone</i>
<i>in the mood for romance.</i>

26
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,211
Guess I'll take my clothes off.

27
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,671
<i>While Ann</i>
<i>less-unflattered herself up,</i>

28
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,589
<i>Gob had an unexpected visitor--</i>

29
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,509
<i>Ann's ex-boyfriend</i>
<i>George Michael,</i>

30
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,095
<i>who, as it turned out,</i>
<i>hadn't completely let go</i>

31
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,306
<i>of the relationship.</i>

32
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,431
(shrieking)

33
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,100
You're lucky that I'm chasing

34
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,393
after our girlfriend,
or I'd have to flatten you!

35
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,481
Whew! Way to plant, Ann.

36
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,275
You told me George Michael
knew about us.

37
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:50,695
Well, he does now,
my darling plant.

38
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:51,696
Ann.

39
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:53,281
And...

40
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:55,575
after I dazzle everyone tonight
on the<i>Queen Mary,</i>

41
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,451
my magic career will take off

42
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,288
as surely as there's a mouse
behind your ear.

43
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,498
(Ann screams)

44
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,252
Well, as surely as there's
a mouse behind your ear.

45
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,920
(Ann screams)

46
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,507
- Mouse behind...
- (Ann screams)

47
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,134
Okay, you are like
the only person I know

48
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,969
who doesn't just love magic.

49
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:18,056
<i>A poll would confirm</i>
<i>she was far from alone.</i>

50
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,599
BEARD:
...for the fifth year in a row,

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,101
your least favorite
entertainers are...

52
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,560
magicians.

53
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,854
A close second,
talk show side-kicks.

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,439
Hmph!

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,650
- (bleep) you, too, America.
- ...'cause I quit.

56
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,278
Well, you have to make things
right with George Michael,

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,987
otherwise you don't get
to fourth base.

58
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,990
<i>Of course, Ann's concept</i>
<i>of fourth base...</i>

59
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>...was very different</i>
<i>than Gob's.</i>

60
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,998
But you have to promise me
you'll always be faithful.

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,876
Faithful?
Of course I can be faithful.

62
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,628
Until tonight, when we're
together, you know...

63
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,213
Oh! Until tonight!

64
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:52,173
Well, of course I can be
faithful-- don't be stupid.

65
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,967
You think I can't
keep it in my pants

66
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,219
in front of a bunch of
doggy old women and my family?

67
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,511
Don't be stupid.

68
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,180
Who am I gonna hit on, stupid?

69
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,932
My sister? Lindsay?

70
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,558
Don't be stupid.

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,269
She's my sister; that's gross.

72
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,396
Now...

73
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,982
you...

74
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,110
have got some mice
to scoop out of the sea.

75
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,612
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

76
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,906
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

77
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,491
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

78
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,910
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

79
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,125
<i>It's Gob's</i>
Arrested Development.

80
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,671
NARRATOR: <i>On the day</i>
<i>of the</i>Queen Mary<i>party,</i>

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,505
<i>Gob remained faithful to Ann,</i>

82
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,134
<i>even in the face</i>
<i>of tremendous temptation.</i>

83
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,636
- Unrelated.
<i>- But there would be</i>

84
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:42,682
- (screaming)
<i>- no career-making magic show.</i>

85
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,100
<i>It seemed the only "her"</i>

86
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,518
<i>Gob would be</i>
<i>getting off that day</i>

87
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,894
<i>was the</i>Queen Mary.

88
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,646
But then the<i>Queen</i>
changed course,

89
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,606
heading back to shore
before crashing into the jetty

90
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,150
and leaving most
of its occupants all wet.

91
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,777
I want all of these
on the insurance form, okay?

92
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,197
These are all part of an act
I was going to do.

93
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,407
Two drowned white doves,
for "flowers to doves."

94
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,037
This was a rabbit, for "doves to
rabbit"-- also drowned.

95
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,163
These were mice...

96
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,457
TOBIAS:
For "rabbit to mice."

97
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:11,294
No, that can't be done.

98
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,712
No, these were
part of a something

99
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,005
I called "Mice-a-laneous."

100
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,425
"Mouse in purse."
"Mouse in drink."

101
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,760
"Here's a mouse, now it's gone."

102
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,556
How'd he do dat?

103
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,058
<i>But it was another man that Gob</i>

104
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,476
<i>needed to make things</i>
<i>right with...</i>

105
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,269
George Michael...

106
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,522
<i>...if he was ever going</i>
<i>to deflower Ann Veal.</i>

107
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,440
Uncle Gob.

108
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:33,816
Are we good?

109
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,318
(George Michael sighs)

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,944
(voice breaking):
No.

111
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,406
No, how could we possibly be?

112
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,325
But... but are we, are we good?

113
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,994
No!
You stole my girlfriend.

114
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,787
That's a tough thing,
and, you know,

115
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,332
sometimes you have to ask
yourself: "Are we good?"

116
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,292
Is it over between you guys?

117
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,960
Oh, no.
But are we good?

118
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,463
I don't know what you want
to hear from me, Uncle Gob.

119
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,549
- I mean, yes, we are good...
- There it is!

120
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,883
There it is!

121
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,552
Ah, from a nephew to his uncle,

122
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,137
and just the "yes,"
the much-vaunted "yes,"

123
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,389
that he gets.

124
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,806
Look at you, full of "yes."

125
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,850
Look at how much "yes"
is in you!

126
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,727
I knew it! I knew I'd get
that "yes" from you.

127
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,479
Look who got a "yes"!
Got my "yes."

128
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:15,316
<i>And Gob realized that there was</i>
<i>finally nothing</i>

129
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,110
<i>standing in the way</i>
<i>of a loving,</i>

130
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,446
<i>committed relationship</i>
<i>with Ann.</i>

For a second, I thought
that was a real guy.

139
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,804
So, listen, I talked to George
Michael and everything's cool.

140
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,013
I need to tell you something,
though.

141
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,266
I've been doing some thinking

142
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:49,601
and I... I just don't...

143
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,852
<i>But as she unzipped</i>
<i>her pajamas,</i>

144
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,522
<i>it reminded him</i>

(light switch clicks)

148
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:08,244
<i>And later, Gob once again tried</i>
<i>to find a compassionate way</i>

00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,496
<i>to end the relationship.</i>

150
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,080
So how did you like your egg?

151
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,706
I said you were fine.

152
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,042
So, was there something you
wanted to talk about

153
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,710
when you came in through
my window?

154
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,964
Gob, what is it?

155
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,928
What... what... is it?

156
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,431
I... (laughs) You...

00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,566
Gob! Calm down!

175
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:23,152
Listen, we had
a great night together.

176
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,196
I understand if you need
your freedom.

177
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,240
Well... marry me.

178
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,910
Yes, I'll...
yes, I'll marry you, Gob!

179
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,828
<i>Of course, Gob meant it</i>

180
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,372

183
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,002
- Marry me! -...marry me!
- ...marry me!

184
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,754
- And may I add: marry me.
- ...marry me.

186

I'm getting married!

<i>Gob shared his happy news</i>

Mouth.

Her.

Oh, hey, mouth.
I didn't see you sitting there.

00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,222
Yeah, me and Blank are getting

203

the old Christian magic act
back together.

204
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,809
I mean, you don't expect people
to actually believe

205

that I'm Jesus,
if I'm walking around in rags.

You're resurrecting
that mumbo-jumbo?

Look, everybody's got a gimmick.

208
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,236

Her!

Me.

216
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,671
- Did I not open with that?
- You sure didn't.

00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,589

- You haven't.
- Well, my wedding's

221
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,643
going to be religious-y and epic
and expensive,

222
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,894
which is why I need more of that
stimmy-mummy.

223
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,522
Thanks, Mike.

00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,692

Excuse me, Father Marsala,
I hate to interrupt,

230
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:39,288
but I am so excited today.

231
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,665
My lovely Ann...

232
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,000
- Who?
- My daughter.

233
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,294
Oh. I didn't know
you had a daughter.

234
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,087
You've met her several times.

235
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,464
Oh.

236
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,591
She's sitting right next to you.

237
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,925
Oh!

238
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,302
That's why she's there.

239
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,512
I thought you were Hair.

240
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:56,430
Hair?

241
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,684
No, she's my daughter,
and she's getting married!

242
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,101
To this good man.

243
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,269
(applause)

244
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,604
Well, and as it is such,

245
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,690
so also as such is it
unto you, young man.

246
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,191
You got it.

247
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,528

dear f... heavenly fathers.

a really great show today

249
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,865
surrounding the Scriptures...

250
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,157
GOB:
We have an announcement to make.

251
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,868
I have an announcement to make:

252
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:21,748
that we would like to televise
our marriage, here on this show.

253
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,500
- (applause)
- My goodness.

254
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,960
Oh, um... we hadn't heard of it.

255
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,128
Did you...?

256
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,380
Well, no, but that's... no...

257
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,758
What an idea. I think...

258
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,885
Well, this show is about
the spirit of inclusion,

259
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,344
- so I would love to say...
- Well, great!

260
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,513
Then I, too,
have an announcement to make!

261
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,014
At our wedding,
I will be performing

262
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,351
one of my
famous magical illusions.

263
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,395
That once your eyes
have beholden it,

264
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,230
you will put no god before me,

265
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,816
because of its spectacularity.

266
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,740
And, of course, I only propose
to do this out of love for...

267
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,032
ANN:
Ann.

268
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,160
And... God.

269
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,747
Love for and God.

270
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,751
Let me pray.
Dearest beloved gods...

271
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:10,379
<i>Gob was feeling bolder,</i>
<i>which was perhaps why</i>

272
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,963
<i>Michael returned home</i>
<i>to find this.</i>

273
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,717
GOB:
And yea, as if to be arisen

274
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,889
the third or fourth day with all
the magic of Jesus Christ!

275
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:22,767
MICHAEL: Sorry.
Wasn't on there too good.

276
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,560
- (Gob grunting, groaning)
- You okay?

277
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,062
Yeah, it's just part of my...
illusion for the wedding.

278
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,314
Yeah, what's the illusion?

279
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,523
That you actually
love the bride?

280
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:33,152
Hey...
that's good patter.

281
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,113
'Cause I need people to root
for the Jesus character.

282
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,282
I don't remember
a biblical passage where Jesus

283
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,742
came out of a boulder--
is it in there?

284
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:40,952
Oh, no, no, no,
the boulder's my escape plan.

285
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,077
They think I'm somewhere else.

286
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,621
I'm actually in the boulder.

287
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,080
But I didn't come here to talk

288
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,499
- about my magic act, Michael.
- Okay.

289
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,460
I came to ask you
to be my best man...

290
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,462
slash-assistant.

291
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,255
And then we'll walk through
the act later, of course.

292
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,132
- I mean, not now.
- No, we're not going to,

293
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,843
'cause you know,
I'm out of the family.

294
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,093
Did you not get that
when I announced it

295
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,804
over at Mom's place?

296
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:02,682
I feel like I was out
of the room at that point.

297
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,224
I am done with this family.

298
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,477
I hope you've saved some money
'cause you...

"You know what?
I'm done with this family.

Maybe you could be a centurion,

305
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,072
kind of standing over
where they think that I'll be.

306
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,616
I'm not going to be in the act.

307

Might be a great promotion

308
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,328
No, Bluth Company's done.

309
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,746
I started my own company:
Michael B. Company.

310
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,247
I have a bee company.

311
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,082
You stole my idea?

312
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,417
Uh-uh, I did not steal your...

313
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,211
We sell...
It would take hours.

314
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,296
How's that going, by the way?

315
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,923
Uh, not so good.

316
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,591
I've been keeping the bees
in my apartment.

317
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,886
I was using my magic smoke
on them.

318
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,303
And my bees are dropping
like flies,

319
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,347
and I need them to fly
like bees.

320
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,016
And so I've got them out
at a bee hospital,

321
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,308
which is not cheap,
which is another reason

322
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,768
I need to be a famous magician.

323
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,812
Yeah, well, listen,
you're with my son's ex,

324
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,397
so I can't support the wedding.

325
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,693
What if I don't actually
get married?

326
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,653
I don't think you'd need
a best man, then, right?

327
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:58,905
No, I guess, at that point,

328
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,156
it'd really be more...
assistant.

329
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,658
Is this an escape act?

330
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,785
- Are you running again?
- What do you want from me?

331
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,538
Marriage is a lot of pressure,
and she's not into it.

332
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,289
Meanwhile, I'm working out
like crazy,

333
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,250
my diet has become insane,

334
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,004
and this Jesus character--
I mean, he was shredded.

335
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,923
Meanwhile, we have sex one time,

336
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,425
and then she's just,
you know, over it.

337
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,718
Lets herself go.

338
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,720
Her stomach's out to here.

339
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:26,348
You know, your whole life
is an escape act,

340
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,559
and this girl seems
like she really likes you.

341
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,686
Why don't you just try
to work it out

342
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,104
and just stop running...?

343
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,610
Yeah, I know you're
in the boulder.

344
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,653
GOB:
But how'd I get in the boulder?

345
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,572
NARRATOR:
<i>And on the day of the wedding,</i>

346
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,866
<i>even though Gob</i>
<i>didn't take it seriously,</i>

347
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,869
<i>he was a little hurt</i>
<i>to discover</i>

348
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,829
<i>no one else</i>
<i>in his family did, either.</i>

349
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,915
ANN:
<i>I know it's bad luck for you</i>

350
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,333
to see me in my gown
before the wedding.

351
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,462
Well, hopefully I haven't.

352
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,464
You're angry.

353
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,549
Why? Because none of my family
has shown up

354
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,843
and the only person I recognize
out there is Tony Wonder,

355
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,012
who's only shown up
hoping that I'd fail?

356
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:08,390
I don't know what
your surprise trick is, but...

357
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,141
I know it's going to be great.

358
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,520
And as for your family...
you have a new family now.

359
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,897
(chuckles)

360
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,192
I don't want these.

361
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,195
- Tobias!
- Gob.

362
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,531
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, how could I not?

363
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,533
I'm playing
Roman Centurion Number Two.

364
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,995
- What are you playing?
- I'm the groom.

365
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,412
I didn't know there
was a groom part.

366
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,623
You know, Betty
at<i>And As It Is Such,</i>

367
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,583
<i>So Also As Such</i>
<i>Is It Unto You</i>casting

368
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,127
told me this was all biblical.

369
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,920
Wait, you're not here
for the wedding?

370
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:41,132
Well, thank you very much
for your vote of confidence.

371
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,050
I'll have you know I've worked
for the Miracle Network

372
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,551
a number of times.

373
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,053
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Coming up next:</i>

374
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,180
<i>Father Marsala's</i>
<i>searing docudrama,</i>

375
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,641
Father Marsala's
John the Baptist.

376
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,810
<i>Then the antiabortion drama,</i>

377

Embryo Dan: It Would Have Been
a Wonderful Life.

378
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,565
<i>And later,</i>
<i>break out the bagels.</i>

379
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,401
<i>It's time for Father M's</i>
<i>lighthearted comedy,</i>

380
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,529
- A Jew Came to Dinner.
- TOBIAS: <i>I hate to be</i>

381
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,156
<i>the guy who quotes</i>
<i>his own reviews,</i>

382

but<i>His Word</i>magazine...

383
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,493
called my Jew "pitiful."

384
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,329
NARRATOR:
<i>But soon,</i>

385
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,706
<i>the wedding began.</i>

386
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,666
PASTOR VEAL:
So, it truly is a blessed day.

387
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,626
I believe that we
are all blessed,

388
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,211
uh, to be gathering here

389
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,464
at the Church
of the Holy Eternal Rapture.

390
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:25,843
Uh, we have almost arrived
at that glorious moment

391
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,554
where we join together
these two very special people,

392
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,264
but first, my almost son-in-law

393
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,309
has something he'd like
to share with all of us,

394
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,311
so, um...

395
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,605
ladies and gentlemen, uh,

396
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,234
please enjoy a magical...

397
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,319
uh, trick.

398
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,286
Thanks for that killer intro.

399
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,000
It's true,
this is a magical trick.

400
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,420
If what Jesus did was a trick.

401
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,338
(crowd gasping)

402
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,924
I say it wasn't.

403
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,051
(laughter, applause)

404
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,846
It was an illusion.

405
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,305
(crowd gasping softly)

406
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,142
TOBIAS:
Ooh, they did not like that one.

407
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:18,562
I don't take notes from you,
Centurion Number Two.

408
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,981
Just turn this thing around.

409
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,527
I am not the real Jesus.

410
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:35,162
I am the Amazing Jesus!

411
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,333
No? I thought that that
would be up your... alley.

412
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,211
Yes, the real Jesus

413
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:44,671
came off the cross
and went into his cave...

414
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,506
a dead man.

415
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,969
NARRATOR:
<i>And Gob's escape boulder</i>

416
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,678
<i>was wheeled up to the trick.</i>

417
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,640
But was he crazy enough
to do it... handcuffed?

418
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,059
Handcuff the King of the Jews!

419
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,394
GOB:
You don't have words here...

420
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,522
Pastor Veal, if you don't mind,
please go up into the cave

421
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,442
and assure everyone
that there's no way to escape:

422
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,778
no trapdoors,
no secret compartments,

423
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,280
no way to get out.

424
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,530
Thank you very...

425
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,032
Pastor Veal, let me remind you

426
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,577
that you are in a church
in front of your daughter,

427
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,788
your congregation, God.

428
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,331
You cannot tell a lie.

429
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,711
Right, nothing
out of the ordinary?

430
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,590
- No, I-I didn't see anything.
- Yes.

431
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:33,637
Jesus went into the cave,
and he arose three days later.

432
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,056
But I'm not going to lock myself
in the cave

433
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,808
for three days
before this wedding ceremony.

434
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,686
No, no. No, no, no.

435
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,397
I plan on beating his record
by two full weeks!

436
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,151
(dramatic music playing)

437
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,962
Into the cave with you!

438
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,298
GOB: No, I said don't underline
the "you" in that.

439
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,717
NARRATOR: <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Gob was not able to open</i>

440
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,427
<i>the secret compartment that</i>
<i>contained the handcuff key.</i>

441
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,429
It's not going to work. Okay,
uh, this isn't going to work.

442
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,015
Let's do...
let's do mouse in drink.

443
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,516
Let's do mouse in drink.
Just get these people

444
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,101
some drinks.
We'll just get a mouse.

445
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,270
No, no, no. No, no, no,
you know not what you do!

446
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:27,107
<i>But it very clearly said</i>
<i>in the centurions' script</i>

447
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,194
<i>to ignore</i>
<i>the magician's protests,</i>

448
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,279
<i>which meant that,</i>
<i>still handcuffed...</i>

449
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,323
But if my hands are handcuffed,
I'll never...

450
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:36,408
<i>...Gob was unable</i>
<i>to break his fall</i>

451
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,951
<i>and was therefore</i>
<i>knocked unconscious.</i>

452
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,120
<i>And as the Gob dummy</i>

453
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,705
<i>was sealed inside the cave,</i>

454
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,708
<i>the real Gob's fate</i>
<i>was sealed, as well.</i>

455
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,466
Well, I guess...
we'll wait two weeks...

456
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,513
...and see if he's in there.

457
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,392
Is that okay with you, Ann?

458
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,977
He's not coming back.

459
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,690
NARRATOR: <i>Gob was stuck</i>
<i>inside a fake boulder in</i>

460
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,525
<i>- the parking lot of a church,</i>
- GOB (weakly): Hey, kids.

461
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,444
<i>while inside the church,</i>
<i>the daily routine</i>

462
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,905
<i>- proceeded as usual</i>
- I-18.

463
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,367
<i>- and the anticipation grew</i>
<i>to a fevered pitch.</i>-I-18.

464
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,494
11 exciting days, um,

465
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,747
although nothing's
really happened.

466
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,291
Day 11.

467
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,418
Once he gets out,
it's going to be

468
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,087
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

469
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:32,256
He's not coming back.

470
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:36,218
<i>But it was Betty</i>
<i>from</i>And As It Is Such,

471
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,678
So Also As Such Is It Unto You
<i>that would render Gob's</i>

472
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,722
<i>- escape act a disaster.</i>-You
got to get rid of this thing.

473
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,808
- I got Mrs. Murray's trailer
here. -I guess, if he comes back

474
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,476
from the dead,
we could just get a stepladder.

475
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,936
- Guys, this, too.
<i>- And a hoarse,</i>

476
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,147
<i>weakened Gob was unable</i>
<i>to stop them</i>

477
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:52,192
<i>as the boulder was shipped</i>
<i>to a storage unit in Tustin.</i>

478
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,278
<i>Although a keen eye could see</i>

479
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,197
<i>that Gob was alive</i>
<i>but not well.</i>

480
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,159
<i>And that's why this</i>
<i>particular chair was empty</i>

481
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,494
<i>at the trial of Lucille Bluth.</i>

482
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,204
Well, I can't thank you
all enough for returning...

483
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,998
<i>At the end of two weeks,</i>
<i>the big day</i>

484
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,458
<i>- finally arrived... again.</i>
- So let's count down.

485
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,127
Let's have some fun,
uh, from five, four...

486
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,755
- three, two, one.
- The dead will walk amongst us.

487
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,050
No, he shan't,
for he-eth not here.

488
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,803
- I knew it.
- TOBIAS: Oh, there's a note.

489
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,807
"If I have not yet returned,
I am in the Rapture."

490
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:28,061
Oh, and then it says,
"Love each other."

491
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,105
MRS. VEAL: What does he think
we've been doing?

492
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,316
I loaned him $1,000.

493
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:35,235
<i>Gob didn't fare much better</i>
<i>than the bride,</i>

<i>of the auction reality show...</i>

496
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,868
MAN:
Moment of truth, people.

497
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,038
It's a masker.

498
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,956
Jesus, there's a man in there.

499
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,666
(auctioneer coughing,
speaking indistinctly)

500
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,543
Let's get the bidding started
at a hundred dollars.

501
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,003
- (hissing)
- Anybody? -Nope.

502
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,255
He's hissing.

503
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,344
NARRATOR:
<i>After a week in the hospital,</i>

504
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:03,514
<i>Gob was happy to finally see</i>
<i>a familiar shape.</i>

505
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:04,723
You humiliated me.

506
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,683
You made a mockery
of my religion

507
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:07,893
and you ruined our wedding.

508
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,230
Our first fight,
and like all fights,

509
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,606
you're a little right,
I'm a little right.

510
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,192
I sold your cave on Craigslist.

511
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,069
So it was all worth it.

512
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,988
We have money to start
our life together.

513
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,909
Now we have our nest, egg-- Ann.

514
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,371
Now we have our, our nest, Ann.

515
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,374
I'm leaving you, Gob.

516
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,125
I don't love you anymore.

517
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,170
I feel sorry for you, and
you're gonna be alone forever

518
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,756
unless you let the Holy Ghost
inside you.

519
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,925
(laughing):
The, the Holy...

520
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,763
(stammering)

521
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,062
You know what?
I hope you read this.

522
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:55,648
NARRATOR: <i>And maybe it was</i>
<i>the fact that he had nothing</i>

523
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,110
<i>in his system</i>
<i>but two weeks of candy vines,</i>

524
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,528
<i>but it did get through to him.</i>

525
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,613
Steve.

526
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,740
It's me. Uh, I-I wanted
to let you know

527
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:08,828
that I am... I'm-I'm ready to...
to... to...

528
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,333
let the son of Gob enfold me.

529
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,002
Have you been to the club And,

530
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,255
owned by Jeremy "Pivan"?

531
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,590
I'm gonna be there tonight
about 8:00.

532
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,300
Maybe you could join me,
I don't...

533
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,760
Obviously it's, it's me,
your fa...

534
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,762
(beep)

535
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,680
Nah, he got it.

536
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,267
Okay.

537
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,977
NARRATOR:
<i>Gob was waiting to meet his son</i>

538
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,937
<i>at a bar and feeling</i>
<i>a little vulnerable.</i>

539
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,646
Lost my wife, lost my career.

540
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,899
When I was in that storage unit
at the bottom of that rock,

541
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,985
it was like I hit...

542
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,445
- Rock bottom?
- No, no, not that.

543
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,447
More like a trending
downward moment

544
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:46,283
that just-- I don't know.

545
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,620
Maybe I'm being tested like
that guy "Jawb" from the Bible.

546
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,204
- (pronounces correctly): Job.
- Yes?

547
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,205
Job.

548
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,415
Yes, sir.

549
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,417
- Job. -Yeah.
- Look, I, I feel sorry

550
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,876
- for you, Pops.
- Hey, pal,

551
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,753
I'm not that much older
than you, guy.

552
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,839
- (chuckles) -Nah, I'm just here,
I'm looking for my son.

553
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,634
I'm trying to get some cash
out of him, actually.

554
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,052
You, you have another son?

555
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,471
(Steve laughing)

556
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,515
I have a brother?

557
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,599
Oh, man.

558
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,225
Yes, Steve.

559
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,561
Yeah.

560
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,771
- What's his name?
- Dave.

561
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,524
Oh, Dave Holt.

562
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,233
- Yeah, Dave Holt.
- Yes.

563
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,818
NARRATOR: <i>Yes, Gob</i>
<i>had been speaking to his son</i>

564
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,487
<i>for an hour and a half.</i>

565
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,197
- Wait, your mom's name is Eve?
- Yeah.

566
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,574
God, I (bleep) a chick
named Eve once.

567
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,493
Biggest mistake of my life.

568
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,036
NARRATOR:
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>

569
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,038
<i>Gob was inadvertently so warm</i>

570
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,831
<i>to his son that Steve</i>

571
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,625
<i>- offered him a job.</i>
- I don't even really have a job.

572
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,751
Would you want
to come work with me?

573
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,961
I mean, I...

574
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,129
Are you serious?

575
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,006
I mean, I'm in pest control, but

576
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,966
father and son.

577
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,677
What a great team.

578
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,844
It would be a great team.

579
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:48,970
I mean, I don't care.

580
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,514
Pest control-- I don't know.

581
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,307
As long as I'm not being
a pest to you, right?

582
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,975
- No, never.
- I mean, I'm kidding.

583
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,102
(Gob mumbling)

584
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,607
Where is your place of business?

585
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:01,983
- 181...
- 181...

586
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,403
- Manville. -Manville.
- Manville.

587
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,736
Manville.

588
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,699
What time do you start
this pest control?

589
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,949
7:00 a.m.

590
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,702
Then I'll be there at 6:45

591
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,161
with two cups of coffee.

592
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,831
Oh, Dad, this is
the greatest day of my life.

593
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,876
No, this is the greatest day
of<i>my</i>life.

594
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,254
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>
<i>it</i>was<i>such a great day...</i>

595
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,256
- 6:45. -6:45.-<i>... that Gob</i>
<i>decided to stay at the bar...</i>

596
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,633
- 6:45.
<i>- ...and show off a little.</i>

597
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,387
I bet it's been a long time
since you've seen your...

598
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,724
- ...cherry.
- I have lupus.

599
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,601
(spits)
Could have warned a guy.

600
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,810
<i>But showing off did catch</i>
<i>the attention of someone.</i>

601
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,104
That was the real deal, huh?

602
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,771
How about this?

603
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,316
How about you do that cherry
trick for my boy Mark Cherry?

604
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,775
Mark Cherry
the baby-faced singer

605
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,570
or Marc Cherry
the baby-faced showrunner?

606
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,614
Baby-faced singer--
right over there, man.

607
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,032
He has loved magic
ever since he was a kid.

608
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,826
NARRATOR: <i>Which was two years</i>
<i>earlier, when Mark Cherry was</i>

609
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,371
<i>the star of a cable teen sitcom</i>
<i>called</i>

610
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,708
Pop-A-ROTC, <i>created by</i>
<i>a longtime writing veteran</i>

611
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,376
<i>of the TV show</i>Cheers.

612
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,920
<i>Soon, Mark Cherry became</i>

613
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,674
<i>a pop sensation</i>
<i>off his cowritten hit single</i>

614
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,217
<i>"Practice Kisses."</i>

615
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,927
JOHN JR:<i>I found a gentleman</i>
<i>who is about</i>

616
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,639
- to do a magic trick for you.
- No, it's an illusion.

617
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,890
A trick is something
a whore does for...

618
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,017
Do a trick and I'll pay
for your bar tab.

619
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,645
- Who wants a trick?
- ALL: Yeah!

620
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,812
(all cheering)

621
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,898
NARRATOR: <i>Gob had them</i>
<i>in the palm of his hand.</i>

622
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,568
<i>He even got the attention</i>

623
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,320
<i>- of a still out-of-control</i>
<i>Rebel Alley...</i>-Do it again.

624
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,029
- I missed it.-<i>... who was</i>
<i>there doing research</i>

625
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,615
<i>- for an upcoming PSA...</i>
- Fireball!

626
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,366
<i>...she'd soon be required</i>
<i>to do by law.</i>

627
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,411
Fire, fire!

628
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,829
Never yell "fire"
in a crowded place.

629
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,039
It's never funny.

630
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,792
That's always funny.

631
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,710
NARRATOR: <i>And she was intrigued</i>
<i>by this magical man.</i>

632
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,378
- Oh...
- Whoa.

633
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,046
That is a David Spade.

634
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,716
(clears throat)
Check your purse.

635
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:50,759
(gasping)

636
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,761
- (Gob chuckles)
- Nice.

637
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,180
Oh, man, paparazzo.

638
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,931
Oh, shoot, great.

639
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,933
The last thing I need is to be
seen partying with some tweens.

640
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,935
I'm trying to clean up my act.

641
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,771
Dude, network's gonna flip

642
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,230
if there's another drunk photo
of you.

643
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,482
- I know.
- We got to get you away

644
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:06,983
- from this place, okay?
- Getting away

645
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,068
is kind of my specialty.

646
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,531
I'll have us out of here
in a flash.

647
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,324
All right.

648
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,201
Let's get out of here while
they still got lighter fluid

649
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,494
- in their eyes.
- Go, baby.

650
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,079
(all laughing)

651
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,540
- Oh, man.
- Oh...

652
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,750
Nice moves, Getaway.

653
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:24,751
Oh.

654
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,670
Okay.

655
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,630
NARRATOR: <i>Gob had been accepted</i>
<i>into the group,</i>

656
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,507
<i>which was bad news for Cherry's</i>

657
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,759
<i>business manager's son</i>
<i>Josh Abramson.</i>

658
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,344
<i>Gob actually did</i>

659
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,012
<i>end up driving down Manville</i>

660
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,681
<i>- at 6:45 a.m.</i>
- This is it! This is...

661
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,850
I'll be with you in a second,
I'll be right there.

662
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,892
Start without me,
just start without me.

663
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,729
Don't worry!

664
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,231
He's not coming back.

665
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,901
NARRATOR:
<i>Gob was living the dream,</i>

666
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,030
<i>and felt like he was</i>
<i>in the center of the entourage,</i>

667
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,200
<i>even though he was three away</i>
<i>from the center at the closest,</i>

668
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,952
<i>and it was pop star</i>
<i>Mark Cherry's dream.</i>

669
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,877
Hey, I'm with, with the guys.

670
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,169
Keep the limo running, Getaway.

671
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,548
That's my job.

672
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,383
(siren chirps)

673
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,468
NARRATOR: <i>The next few months</i>
<i>were a blur of partying...</i>

674
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,927
(shouting)

675
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,430
<i>...and shame.</i>

676
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,930
(shouting and laughter)

677
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,601
<i>But Gob had a trick</i>

678
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:25,520
<i>for helping him forget</i>
<i>the shame.</i>

679
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,858
<i>Unfortunately</i>

713

You have a five-year-old?

716
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,152
My granddaughter.

717

- (bleep) Getaway.
<i>- ...that inspired Mark Cherry</i>

I know guys just like that.

725
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,257
NARRATOR: <i>And as his life</i>

726
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,385

732
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,690
NARRATOR:
<i>And Gob returned just in time</i>

733
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,107
<i>to catch his friends going out</i>

734
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,359

put my sick bees in the trunk.

738
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,325
NARRATOR:
<i>And perhaps this was the moment</i>

739
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,995
<i>that Gob could sense</i>
<i>the tide was turning.</i>

740
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,955
It's my fault, guys.
I made a mistake.

NARRATOR: <i>In an effort to remain</i>
<i>popular with the gang,</i>

743
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,048
<i>Gob stopped in front of a club</i>
<i>to pick up some women.</i>

744

GOB: Who wants to party
with Mark Cherry?

745
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,719
Uh, me, me, me...

746
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,221
That's one forget-me-now saved,
huh, fellas?

747
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:08,934
Oh, looks like we got a real
live one, and by alive, I mean

748
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,894
barely alive.

754

- MARK: Hey, Getaway.
- Yeah.

755
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,821
You know what'd be really cool?

756
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,740
If you shut the partition.

757
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,910
It'd be like, uh, like a joke,
like you're our limo driver...

758
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,286
That would be hilarious, right?

759
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,707
"Oh, yes, very good,
sir, very good."

760
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,459
Right?

761
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,544
Be like, "I'm... I'm just
driving the queen of England,"

762
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,337
but we're still--
we're taking our clothes off.

763
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,881

DEBRIE:

765

766
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,845
Like, what's in here? You have
the good stash in here?

767
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:46,846

<i>Gob's bees were feeling</i>
<i>good enough to sting again.</i>

I see this boat and I'm like,
"Those are police boats,"

776
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,622
so, anyway, I'm running around

777
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,666

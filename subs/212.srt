1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,384
George Michael?
<i>Michael was looking for his son...</i>

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,581
<i>with whom he had a secret to share.</i>

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,591
- There you are. Hey, pal. You alone?
- Almost always, yeah.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,025
<i>You know,</i>
<i>Maeby's never around anymore...</i>

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,791
and Ann's off with her religious group,
trying to get <i>Nip/Tuck</i> off the air.

10
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,458
- They don't like <i>Nip/Tuck?</i>
- Well, you know, they don't like anything.

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,035
Something about God wants people
to age naturally- I don't know.

12
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,037
Ironically, she likes Gangy.

13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,701
Listen, you know, I would never date anyone
without you being okay with it, right?

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,906
- You don't have to do that.
- Great, because I didn't do it this time.

15
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:53,042
<i>L- I kind of reconnected with that blind</i>
<i>prosecutor I used to date, Maggie Lizer.</i>

16
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,882
Her?

17
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,253
- Didn't she turn out to not be blind though?
- <i>Exactly.</i>

18
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,259
But she's filled out a little bit.

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,989
<i>Michael hadn't seen her</i>
<i>in eight and a half months...</i>

20
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,065
<i>during which she</i> had <i>filled out.</i>

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,396
Really?
Could have sworn it was a year.

22
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:13,131
And it seems as if I'm the father.

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,833
Do you know this for sure?
I mean, she does lie.

24
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,467
- She might not really be pregnant.
- See, that's what I thought.

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,478
- Boy, you really are my kid.
- Good.

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,174
Apparently, so is this one.

27
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,751
<i>Michael found this out</i>
<i>after having Lindsay and Tobias...</i>

28
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,185
<i>break into Maggie's house</i>
<i>and hide in the bathroom...</i>

29
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>to collect and test her urine.</i>

30
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,691
- <i>It was there that they stumbled upon a fat suit.</i>
- That's what it is.

31
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,820
<i>Michael confronted Maggie about this.</i>

32
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,662
Oh, you're so right, Michael,
'cause I'm fakin' it-

33
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,204
- <i>But he was proven wrong.</i>
- Not.

34
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,468
<i>Maybe it'll be exciting, you know?</i>
<i>Be a big brother. It'll be fun.</i>

35
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,601
- There you go. It would be fun, wouldn't it?
- Big brother. Me.

36
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,111
Not gonna happen though.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.

37
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,877
But I know you've been bored.
You and I are gonna have some fun together.

38
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,612
Maybe we'll even have ourselves
a little adventure.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,746
- Yeah.
- Meanwhile, I guess
this family's big enough, huh?

40
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,054
<i>In fact, Michael's family</i>
<i>hadjust gotten a little smaller.</i>

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,253
Hello?

42
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,058
Mom, you've got to stop
starting conversations like that.

43
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,794
Something happened to Buster.
He lost part of his body.

44
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,803
- I don't know which one.
- The hand.

45
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,339
I told him to stay out of the ocean,
but we had a fight.

46
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,568
- Who remembers about what?
- <i>I do.</i>

47
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,510
<i>Buster had discovered that</i>
<i>his Uncle Oscar was his true father.</i>

48
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,139
- You lied to me.
- You were never supposed to know.

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,741
I'm going to war!

50
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:37,152
<i>As an act of defiance to Lucille,</i>
<i>he first went swimming in the ocean...</i>

51
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,021
<i>where he was attacked by a loose seal.</i>

52
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,151
If only your father was here.

53
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,392
- Oh, that George. God only knows where he is.
- The car!

54
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,663
- Up yours, granny!
- You couldn't handle it!

55
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,568
<i>In fact, George Sr.</i>
<i>Had snuck out of the attic...</i>

56
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,971
<i>and gone to a local Ford dealership.</i>

57
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,043
Yeah, the Bronco's been discontinued.

58
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,578
We're trying to shed that whole
"fugitive on the run" thing.

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,581
- This is the Escape.
- What a fun name, hmm?

60
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,878
- Mm-hmm.
- May I test-drive?

61
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,519
- Up yours, granny!
<i>- You couldn't handle it!</i>

62
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,025
<i>Soon, Michael and</i>
<i>George Michael arrived at the hospital.</i>

63
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,461
- If something happens to Buster, I'll be lost.
- Yeah. Excuse me.

64
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,932
George Michael, you're going to
have to be the baby of the family.

65
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,903
- Um, Maeby's younger than me.
<i>- You're never going in the ocean! Never!</i>

66
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,633
- We're here to see him.
- You're my baby! I'm never letting you go!

67
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,733
- Please stay away from my son.
- You're my baby now! No, he's my baby!

68
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,108
The hell with all of you.
I have a man.

69
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,048
Excuse me.

70
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,381
- <i>Are you the Bluths?</i>
- <i>Not Dr. Wordsmith.</i>

71
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,080
- How's my son?
- He's going to be all right.

72
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,384
- Thank God.
- <i>Finally some good news from this guy.</i>

73
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,959
- No other way to take that.
- That's a great attitude.

74
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,758
I gotta tell you. If I was given this news,
I don't know that I'd take it this well.

75
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,491
But you said he was all right.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,127
Yes. He's lost his left hand,
so he's going to be "all right."

77
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,671
You son of a bitch!
I hate this doctor!

78
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:04,505
- He's a very literal man.
- Yes, that's more the way I would take the news.

79
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,511
<i>Actually, I'm relieved.</i>

80
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,741
I don't have to go to army because
the seal with the bow tie attacked me.

81
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,114
- I feel like I've lost three pounds.
- Seal with the bow tie?

82
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,278
Yeah.
I think that's what I saw bite me.

83
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,119
I just wish I could remember why I went
in the ocean. Did we fight or something?

84
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,125
Of course not.

85
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,492
Although I always have warned you
against the ocean. So has your father.

86
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,259
My father.

87
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,494
George Sr. You need more juice.

88
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,595
Where's the juice?
Give my son the juice!

89
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,936
Buster, it's okay.
Doctor says you're gonna be fine.

90
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,533
And if they can find the hand,
they're gonna be able to reattach it.

91
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,545
- You know, like a transplant.
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

92
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:46,279
This is a blessing. And speaking of blessings,
I heard there's gonna be a baby.

93
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:50,288
Oh, yeah, yeah.
But please, don't worry about that.

94
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,950
What's more important is that you're
really doin' well with this, pal.

95
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,788
My hat is off to you.

96
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,795
And my hand is off to you.

97
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,294
No, no, I meant, don't get
your hopes up about that-

98
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,862
Hand transplant.

99
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,501
No, the, uh, baby.
The mother doesn't want me around.

100
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,341
We kind of had a little bit of a fight.

101
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,644
- You obviously care about
this Maggie woman, don't you?
- Yes, I do. Of course I do.

102
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,514
I mean, a seal didn't bite
your Linus off, did it?

103
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,248
- No, a seal didn't bite my Linus off.
- Good.

104
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,347
- <i>Then go to her. Ask for her hand.</i>
- Yeah.

105
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,427
And, uh, maybe...

106
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,224
I'll get one for my brother
while I'm at it.

107
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,199
Yeah. Get him out of here.

108
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,428
- Hmm?
- Get him out of here!

109
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,334
Get the-
Out of my room!

110
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,737
- Oh, my God! Buster!
- Oh, my God!

111
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,935
Buster, what's wrong? Nurse!

112
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,012
<i>So, at his brother's suggestion...</i>

113
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,843
<i>Michael went to the courthouse</i>
<i>determined to win Maggie back.</i>

114
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,009
- Have you seen Maggie? It's kind of important.
- Oh, you just missed her.

115
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,020
She's in the bar.
What a spanking I gave her in court today.

116
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,591
- Go get 'em.
- He spanked me!

117
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,660
- Did you spank her?
- No!

118
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,356
<i>You know, that waitress she's representing</i>
<i>is suing my client for making her fat.</i>

119
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,026
But here's the thing.
Loretta is not fat.

120
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,094
Maggie bought her a fat suit,
and I've got the receipt to prove it.

121
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,572
Of course.
That's what the fat suit is for.

122
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,576
Well, I've gotta find her. I owe her an apology.
You said she's at a bar?

123
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,772
Friday night. You might want
to try Miss Temple's. Tell her Barry said-

124
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,315
Ooh, I did good today.

125
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,544
<i>And Michael caught up with Maggie.</i>

126
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,586
You know,
there have been lies, yes.

127
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,283
But it's not like either one of us would ever
do anything to hurt the other person.

128
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,292
Hello, Officers.

129
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,557
Well, there's no further sign
of a break-in at your house.

130
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:41,724
<i>And since you haven't called us back, we again</i>
<i>left the number, in case there's a problem.</i>

131
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,598
- Thanks, Officer Taylor.
- <i>Just next time, uh, call us back.</i>

132
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,729
Hey, the break-in?
I told you that was us.

133
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,605
Well, maybe I did want to hurt you,
because I was hurt.

134
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,649
- The only reason you're here
is out of loyalty to the baby.
- It's not just about the baby.

135
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,616
Maggie, there was a reason that you and I
got together in the first place...

136
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,687
when we made this baby, okay?

137
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,418
There's something here, as long
as we never lie to each other again.

138
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,859
Well, then I have to come clean
about one more thing.

139
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,930
- Oh, no.
- You're not the father.

140
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,498
Come on.

141
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,296
I went to a sperm bank, okay,
the week before we even met.

142
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,100
The father's some guy from Harvard,
but that's all I know.

143
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,301
That's great. He's probably
some geek <i>Simpsons</i> writer's kid.

144
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,776
I never thought
I'd meet someone like you.

145
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,608
- Mmm.
- But come on.

146
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,615
I mean, do you still really want me?

147
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,514
Are you really that great of a guy?

148
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,419
<i>Michael had always thought</i>
<i>ofhimself as that great a guy.</i>

149
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,789
- <i>The kind of guy who could</i>
<i>raise someone else's baby.</i>
- Of course I am.

150
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,862
<i>But he wasn't...</i>

151
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,796
<i>and he regretted it the moment he said it.</i>

152
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,202
<i>The next day, the family gathered</i>
<i>to welcome Buster home from the hospital.</i>

153
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,502
<i>He's coming.</i>
<i>What he's wearing is temporary.</i>

154
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:01,546
Please don't comment on it or salute him
like that idiot guard down there did to him.

155
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,912
Well, look who's back.

156
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,212
- <i>Let's all say hello.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

157
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,517
And while you're at it,
let's all give me a big hand!

158
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,688
George Michael, get your uncle
a bandage for his forehead.

159
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,766
And while you're at it, uh, get two.

160
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,266
Oh, my God.

161
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,166
Guess this means you don't wanna
play "got your nose" with me.

162
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,937
Oh, what's the matter, Buster?

163
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,942
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Uh, hi, Gob.

164
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,512
Oh, my God! What-What happened to your-
He's got no hand!

165
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,582
Buster went swimming in the ocean...

166
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,378
and, according to him,
a seal with a bow tie bit off his hand.

167
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,850
Bow tie?

168
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,081
It's merely the playful mutterings
of the shock victim.

169
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,249
A seal would never prey on a human...

170
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,123
unless, of course, it had acquired
a taste for mammal blood.

171
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,526
<i>Gob had recently dressed a seal in a bow tie...</i>

172
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,099
<i>and used him in a magic trick.</i>

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,725
<i>When it failed,</i>
<i>he released the seal into the ocean.</i>

174
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,795
You're back in the real world.
You're not gonna be hand-fed anymore.

175
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,637
How the hell would a seal know
how to tie a bow tie anyway?

176
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,112
- I can barely tie
the yellow one that I wear in my act.
- This one had a yellow bow tie!

177
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,806
Really?

178
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,714
<i>And later, Lucille</i>
<i>could not contain her guilt any longer.</i>

179
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,652
I did this. I prayed that God
take anything he wanted from us...

180
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,656
so that Buster wouldn't
have to go to war.

181
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,387
Oh, Mom. After all these years,
God's not gonna take a call from you.

182
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,622
<i>I did this.</i>

183
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,324
<i>I think that the seal with</i>
<i>the yellow bow tie might be the one...</i>

184
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,664
that I released into the sea after giving it
the taste for mammal blood.

185
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,830
Okay. You've got a better case
than Mom does.

186
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,340
Still, I could hunt down that seal.

187
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,071
They said if you retrieve Buster's hand,
they might be able to do a transplant.

188
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,945
At the very least, I can remove
that incriminating bow tie.

189
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,110
<i>And Michael told Lindsay</i>
<i>about his commitment to Maggie...</i>

190
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,187
<i>and the child that wasn't his.</i>

191
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,587
Well, first of all, I'm sure there are writers
on <i>The Simpsons</i> who aren't geeks.

192
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,627
And secondly, I think this commitment
you're making is great.

193
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,628
It is. It's great, it's great.

194
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,790
I do think something might be up though.
What if she's still lying?

195
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,198
Oh, no. You're trying to
get out of this, aren't you?

196
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,532
- L-I thought you were a good guy.
- I am a good guy.

197
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,698
- Is he trying to get out of having this baby?
- We want this child.

198
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,333
It's given us a reason to stay together.

199
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,038
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was investigating the pregnancy...</i>

200
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,877
<i>that had reignited</i>
<i>Lindsay and Tobias's passion.</i>

201
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,952
<i>It was weird.</i>

202
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,020
- Where's your child?
- I don't have a child, Michael.

203
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,589
- We don't have a child, Michael.
- That's why we want-

204
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,851
- Oh.
- Did you mean Maeby?

205
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,055
- I did mean Maeby.
- Well, she's hardly a child, is she, Michael?

206
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,131
Yeah. And we know where she is.

207
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,066
She's with her debate club, and they're on
their way to Sacremende for the semifinals.

208
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,069
<i>She wasn't.</i>

209
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,267
<i>And a Google search of the word</i>
<i>"Sacremende"only came up with this.</i>

210
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,676
<i>In fact, she was overseeing a remake</i>
<i>of</i>The Old Man And The Sea...

211
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,181
<i>for the film studio where she'd</i>
<i>bluffed her way into a job.</i>

212
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,251
What on earth is taking so long?

213
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,877
Am I the only one who wants
to get home and see their kids?

214
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,582
<i>So please don't tell me</i>
<i>I don't know where my kid is.</i>

215
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:03,025
All I'm saying is that Maggie claims
that no one else is involved.

216
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,030
But what if she's lying again
and there is someone else involved?

217
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,464
You know, a boyfriend, a husband.

218
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,730
Someone that got dumped
when something better came along.

219
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,034
- Of course. Why wouldn't she?
- I'm a good guy, you know.

220
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,609
So I'm thinkin' maybe you can
break into her house again for me...

221
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,439
and see if you can find some, uh-

222
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,105
Way out of this for you?
I don't think so.

223
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:26,310
No, I was gonna say, find some evidence
of who the father is, but forget it.

224
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,378
I'll find somebody
who wants an adventure.

225
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,583
George Michael, how would
you like to get away from Uncle Buster?

226
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,661
- I'd really like that.
- Good. Shh, shh, shh.

227
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,491
<i>And so, with his son's help,</i>
<i>Michael went to Maggie's...</i>

228
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,531
<i>to find some evidence of another man.</i>

229
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,101
It's another Bluth Boy adventure.
We're like a team.

230
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,534
- We're like Red McGibbon and Bullet.
- Who?

231
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,606
They're this old, uh-
Never mind. Okay, listen.

232
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,143
<i>Anything you find in there-name, phone</i>
<i>number-you bring it out to Daddy, all right?</i>

233
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,234
- You mean you're not going in with me?
- Hmm? No.

234
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,643
I can't fit through that doggy door.

235
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,206
But I am gonna risk being caught out here.
Be careful.

236
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,444
Okay, I got a phone number.
Let's go. Drive.

237
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,718
- Let's go. Hit the gas.
- You didn't even go inside.

238
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,420
- It was taped to the door.
- It's probably the Sparkletts guy.

239
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,827
Listen, it's okay. I'm telling you.
There's nothing to be scared about.

240
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,662
I'm not getting that vibe. Hey!

241
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,736
- Everything all right?
- Yes, Officer.

242
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,328
- Just waiting to see if Maggie's home.
- Oh.

243
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,408
I was making sure there wasn't
another break-in.

244
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,841
My partner is inside
with his gun drawn.

245
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,505
Everything's gonna be just fine.

246
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,343
Close call there, Bullet.
I'm so sorry about that.

247
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,412
<i>But listen, I think</i>- <i>I think that you do have</i>
<i>something here with this phone number.</i>

248
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,549
"Really eager to hear from you."

249
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,787
You know, that's something a guy would say
if he was the father of her child...

250
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,763
and the mother stopped calling
'cause she found a really good guy.

251
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,358
I think this is him. I'm gettin' that vibe.
We're havin' some fun, aren't we?

252
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,198
I'm really sorry about that.

253
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,638
<i>Gob arrived at the dock,</i>
<i>hoping to recover his brother's missing hand.</i>

254
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,269
I'm lookin' for the seal
that's got the taste for kitty blood.

255
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,711
I'll pay you handsomely.

256
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,273
<i>In fact, the skipper had already</i>
<i>rented his boat to be shot in Maeby's film.</i>

257
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,513
<i>So neither he nor Gob were prepared...</i>

258
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,955
<i>for the challenges of using cats to catch a seal.</i>

259
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:17,051
God! It's like herding cats.

260
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,188
Here's your kitty cat. Aah! Fine!

261
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,198
You don't get to be bait!

262
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,268
Why are there cats in the shot?

263
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,861
This is the camera boat.
Can you lose the- cats, please?

264
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,872
Uncle Gob?

265
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,076
Maeby?

266
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,511
<i>And Michael traced the phone</i>
<i>number he found on the note to an address.</i>

267
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,674
Thank you, Mr. Parmesan. Okay.

268
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,720
In there is the father of the child
that Maggie wants me to help her raise.

269
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,985
<i>And he probably doesn't know</i>
<i>that she's got another man involved.</i>

270
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,924
So I want you to stay here
and enjoy the adventure from the car.

271
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,520
This one could get a little ugly.

272
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,829
And, hey, I'd like to see that cop of Maggie's
do detective work this good. Huh?

273
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,365
Oh, come on.
Is this your phone number?

274
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,739
Hey, I told you at the bar.
I left that on Maggie's door.

275
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,006
And why are you hangin'
around Maggie's house, anyway?

276
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,445
L- I'm sorry.
I'm in this crazy relationship.

277
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,518
She wants me to raise this child with her
because there's no father.

278
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,587
- No father?
- I thought I'd come here-

279
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,350
There's a father.
There's two fathers. David!

280
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:22,257
- <i>I'm making gravy.</i>
- That bitch is gonna keep our child.

281
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,127
I knew she was up to something.

282
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,792
<i>Hot cops</i>
<i>Hot</i>

283
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:36,073
<i>Michael had tracked down the</i>
<i>couple who'd hired Maggie to carry their child.</i>

284
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,702
- So that's why you guys are staking out her house.
- <i>She hasn't returned our calls.</i>

285
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,474
- There's something about her I just don't trust.
- <i>I'll say.</i>

286
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,947
She said she doesn't know
who the father is.

287
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,144
<i>In a funny way, neither do we.</i>
<i>Wejust gave her a mixed cocktail.</i>

288
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,154
- Two parts Taylor.
- Two parts Carter.

289
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,156
And let her do her thing.

290
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,421
<i>We decided we never want to know</i>
<i>which of us is the real father.</i>

291
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,030
Well, why should you?

292
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,295
I just hope you find out which one of you
can breast-feed.

293
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,098
You know,
we're in a loving relationship.

294
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,606
<i>Andjust because we don't have breasts</i>
<i>does not mean we cannot nourish our child.</i>

295
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,608
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-</i>

296
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,679
I don't want you guys to worry about
getting that child back from Maggie...

297
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,010
because I'm gonna help you.

298
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,175
Wow. What a... good guy.

299
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,948
I know. And for once,
I'm one lie ahead of Maggie Lizer's lies.

300
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,785
<i>In fact, Michael was one lie behind her.</i>

301
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,419
<i>And what if I told you</i>
<i>that Loretta was not fat...</i>

302
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,963
but actually a very greedy woman...

303
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,125
in a very cheap fat suit?

304
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,760
<i>What, do you think I'm kidding?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

305
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,840
- What are you doing?
- Okay, so she's fat.

306
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,707
- Your Honor, this is an outrage!
- Wow. Did I lose this one.

307
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,279
Mr. Zuckerkorn,
you've been warned about touching.

308
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,713
- You said spanking.
- I want this case thrown out immediately.

309
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,547
<i>In fact, Loretta wasn't overweight</i>-

310
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:58,282
- Oh, no! My water just broke!
- Quickly, Your Honor. Quickly throw it out.

311
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,325
<i>but was carrying the child</i>
<i>that Maggie was supposed to.</i>

312
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:06,524
<i>You see, it was Loretta's urine that</i>
<i>Tobias and Lindsay ended up testing...</i>

313
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,227
<i>a fact they missed when they were</i>
<i>making out in the shower.</i>

314
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,237
<i>And Maggie did buy the fat suit</i>
<i>to serve as her pregnancy belly.</i>

315
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,239
All right, this is goin' back.

316
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,074
<i>But soon upgraded</i>
<i>to a higher-quality latex model.</i>

317
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,704
<i>It's time!</i>

318
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,012
- <i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>
- Oh, my God! My water broke too!

319
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,018
I'm in labor!

320
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,989
<i>Maggie wasn't, but had no choice</i>
<i>but to pretend to deliver at the same time.</i>

321
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,220
<i>And Gob caught up with Maeby</i>
<i>and made a confession.</i>

322
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,489
I think I'm responsible
for Buster's hand.

323
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,361
Yeah, and I'm responsible for
an $80-million movie without an ending.

324
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,095
I know those problems seem big
when you're a kid, Maeby.

325
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,797
Look, this is kind of weird
advice for me to be giving...

326
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,032
but why don't you
just tell him the truth?

327
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,041
I mean, he'll respect you for it.

328
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,669
Thanks, Maeby.

329
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,613
Okay, now I'm just lying
for no reason.

330
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,048
<i>And Michael arrived at the courthouse...</i>

331
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,750
<i>only to discover that Maggie</i>
<i>had already been rushed to the hospital.</i>

332
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,522
<i>And back at the penthouse, Lucille was</i>
<i>praying for the second time in her life.</i>

333
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,063
Lord, let Buster forget everything.

334
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,828
And if you need to take another hand
to make that happen...

335
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,903
please make it Gob's.

336
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,964
<i>It was at that exact moment</i>
<i>that Buster did forget he'd lost his hand.</i>

337
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,135
Oh! No, stop it, stop it, stop it!

338
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,510
<i>Oh, you caught my tendon</i>
<i>in your claw!</i>

339
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:34,143
My claw? Aw, God!

340
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm a monster!

341
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:44,424
No!

342
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,431
Whose idea was the temporary hand?

343
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,967
<i>Buster!</i>

344
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,435
Hi. There's something
you need to know.

345
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,598
There's nothing he needs to know.
Take his hand. Take it now!

346
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,937
It was my fault. It was my seal.

347
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,637
I released him,
and he bit off your hand.

348
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,271
Wow. Truth feels good.

349
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,782
- You did this to me?
- Yeah.

350
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,843
<i>And Gob was about to experience</i>
<i>something that didn't feel that good.</i>

351
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,946
<i>No, Buster! Oh!</i>

352
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,924
<i>Michael, meanwhile, notified the</i>
<i>policemen that Maggie was in the hospital.</i>

353
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,655
- I will meet you there.
- We're on our way.

354
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,663
I'm getting goose bumps.

355
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,233
Hi. Okay.
I'm gonna go in there with Maggie.

356
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,802
As far as I know, she's already
had the kid, okay?

357
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,361
We're havin' some adventure though, huh?
You can't say we're not havin' fun.

358
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,777
Don't smoke, sonny.

359
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,810
Michael.
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

360
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:45,288
<i>Is this our little bundle</i>
<i>of... two gay cops' baby?</i>

361
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,661
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

362
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,856
Here it is.
This came from our cup.

363
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,161
That fellow was in our cup once.

364
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,668
Here's something I think
you both need to have.

365
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,042
Boy, you just cannot get off
the breast thing, can you?

366
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,510
Okay, where's the baby?

367
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,140
- I'm not pregnant.
- But we paid you to do this, Maggie.

368
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,014
I know, and I wanted to, but then
it turns out I couldn't get pregnant.

369
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,919
And I had this client-You know,
we were working on the fat case.

370
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,015
So l-
Hey, I outsourced it, okay?

371
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,220
And you weren't gonna let
these nice guys have a baby?

372
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,229
You were gonna have us raise it?

373
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,231
Of course not.

374
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,200
<i>I'm gonna give 'em their baby.</i>
<i>I never thought you'd stick around.</i>

375
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,203
I'm not goin' anywhere, baby.

376
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,739
What is wrong with me?

377
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,571
<i>Oh! Here it comes!</i>
<i>Here comes the baby!</i>

378
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,542
<i>Is that the head?</i>

379
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,912
<i>Loretta had her baby, and</i>
<i>the new family couldn't have been happier.</i>

380
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,817
- <i>And Michael reunited with his son.</i>
- You disappointed?

381
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,186
You kiddin' me?
You're the only son I've ever needed.

382
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,816
That's all the adventure I've ever needed.

383
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:59,421
Okay. Son, I'm going to meet you
at the car. "M." Main floor.

384
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,431
<i>No adventure there.</i>

385
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,400
<i>But "M"didn't stand for "main floor."</i>

386
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,640
<i>Dr. Ward to the morgue, please.</i>

387
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,368
<i>Dr. Ward to the morgue, please. Stat.</i>

388
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,774
<i>And Michael said good-bye to Maggie.</i>

389
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,143
- I know. I've got a problem.
- We obviously both do.

390
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,776
We obviously both crave
some crazy complication in our lives.

391
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,753
When we're together, it is like-

392
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,119
- Magic?
- I was gonna say "train wreck."

393
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,750
We have to make a vow, okay?
This is over.

394
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,297
No more lying.
No deceit, no sex. Everything.

395
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,890
No more lies.

396
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,199
<i>But that, too, turned out to be a lie.</i>

397
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,181
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

398
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,316
<i>Buster and Gob</i>
<i>find themselves closer than ever.</i>

399
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,259
And there you are. We've removed the hook,
and there's been no damage.

400
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,389
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

401
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,094
But unfortunately,
you've still got a hook in your ass.

402
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,671
<i>And Maggie gets a big surprise.</i>

403
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,866
You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me.

404
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,245
<i>Hot cops</i>
<i>We'll clean up the town</i>

405
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,043
<i>We'll turn that old frown</i>
<i>upside down</i>

406
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,675
<i>Hot cops</i>
<i>We're aiming to please</i>

407
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,755
<i>You know we'll get down</i>
<i>on our knees</i>

408
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,484
<i>We're taking on the bad boys</i>

409
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,220
<i>With our loaded guns</i>

410
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,229
<i>We'll pump you full</i>
<i>of molten lead</i>

411
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,697
<i>Bang, bang, you're dead</i>

412
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,064
<i>Hot cops</i>

413
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,831
<i>Just give us a squeeze</i>

414
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,736
<i>Hot cops</i>
<i>Hot</i>

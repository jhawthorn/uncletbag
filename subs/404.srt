00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,381
NARRATOR: Michael Bluth
was starting a new job

3
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,337
when he received a call
from attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.

4
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:18,084
Hello. Michael Bluth,
residential complexes.

5
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,445
- (horn honks)
- MAN: Take a picture of this!

6
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:20,242
BARRY:
Hey, Michael.

7
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:22,297
- You're in real estate again?
- Sort of.

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,758
Michael had tried
to leave real estate behind

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,301
and get a job
in the high-tech sector.

10
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:27,594
However...

11
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,680
I will tell you
that in my last position,

12
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,640
I had a company car provision.

13
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,143
I think we may have something
that can get you a car.

14
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,727
- Hey, Gare-Bear?
- Yeah?

15
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,479
I think we got an ostrich.

16
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,106
- Oh, God, grab him.
- What is it?

17
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:42,484
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

18
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,444
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

19
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:46,196
NARRATOR:
Albeit one that had trouble

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,117
negotiating
low-hanging obstacles.

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,368
(horn honking)

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,871
(tires squealing)

23
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,874
Which is why
he'd parted with it.

24
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,458
MICHAEL: I'm actually working
in high tech,

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,127
but it does collide
with real estate.

26
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,130
This is going to be low.

27
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:04,464
Ah, I hooked it.

28
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,507
NARRATOR:
Michael was driving a car

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,842
from a company that shows

30
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:09,178
every private residence
in the country.

31
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,389
But it's also a company
that won't let us

32
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,516
show the car
that takes those pictures.

33
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:17,186
In fairness to them,
it is their property.

34
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,604
(horn honking)

35
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,365
If you want to know
what the company is...

36
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,117
Save it. We're just
going to blur it anyway.

37
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,317
...all you have to do is...

38
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:24,063
"something" it.

39
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:25,420
Barry, you still there?

40
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,881
So I got a really
interesting call

41
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,050
from Ron Howard, of all people.

42
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,760
He's directing now, apparently,

43
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,428
and wants to meet you
at his office

44
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,889
in-- get this-- Beverly Hills.

45
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,266
- Why does Ron How...
- (horn honks)

46
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,309
Why does Ron Howard want
to meet with me?

47
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,186
Oh, I didn't know. His office
didn't say, and if you

48
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,146
don't mind, I'm a little busy
with a case of my own.

49
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,107
Did you get
any other information?

50
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,401
Apparently, he directed
a movie called Cocoon.

51
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,986
MICHAEL:
Sorry. I was unclear

52
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,863
about why he wants
to meet with me.

53
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,531
I don't know. You want me to
tell him to go (bleep) himself?

54
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,533
I can tell Ron Howard
to go (bleep) himself.

55
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,285
Tell him to shove it
up his (bleep).

56
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,578
I just can't do it now

57
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,413
because I'm in front of a jury.

58
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,914
Barry, I will meet with him.

59
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,374
You're in front of a jury
right now?

60
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,251
Oh, and the looks I'm getting.
Got to go.

61
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:06,128
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

62
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,255
BOB: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

63
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:11,008
I'd like the defendant
to reach over the school gate,

64
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,426
open it from the inside

65
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,386
and enter the school
property, please.

66
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:17,514
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the knob.

67
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,266
Why is that,
Mr. Zuckerkorn?

68
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,226
- I'm not tall enough.
- You're not tall enough.

69
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,186
I can't reach the chotchie.

70
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,897
Hey, should I try tippy-toe?

71
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,440
Look, I'm on tippy-toes.

72
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,400
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

73
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,986
Ooh, and that's what
we call a Law Bomb.

74
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,362
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

75
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,614
A Bob Loblaw Law Bomb.

76
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,285
NARRATOR:
Now the story

77
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,078
of a wealthy family
who lost everything

78
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,247
and the one son
who had no choice

79
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,374
but to keep them all together.

80
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,506
It's...

81
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:56,427
Michael drove to the
North American headquarters

82
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,096
of Imagine Entertainment,

83
00:02:58,138 --> 00:03:00,891
the modest television
and streaming colossus

84
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:03,268
of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.

85
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,897
And got his first taste
of how cruel Hollywood can be.

86
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,815
That's not very nice.

87
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:11,151
KITTY: "Ankles" means "leaves"
in Variety, Michael.

88
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:14,279
Kitty Sanchez.
What are you doing here?

89
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,989
I work here. I'm a "D" girl.

90
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,616
No, I don't want to see them.

91
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:20,494
I'm not going to show you
my (bleep), you pig.

92
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,162
It means "development."

93
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,915
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

94
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:27,918
NARRATOR: And she'd proven
as loyal to him as she was

95
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,461
to her former boss,
Michael's father.

96
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:33,382
But without the
quote, unquote "benefits."

97
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,134
Also, Imagine provided
no health benefits.

98
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,053
Great for you.
How'd you get this job?

99
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:41,056
Women can be movie executives,
you pig. I knew people.

100
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,392
You're probably going to call me
a pig for this, too,

101
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,019
but are you sure that
you meant to say "knew"?

102
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,479
She did.

103
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,201
The only thing at Imagine
that Kitty blew

104
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:52,067
was smoke up the skirt
of the young woman

105
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,945
who hired her,
Michael's niece, Maeby,

106
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:57,280
who was then working
as a film executive.

107
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,199
My first project
is about my family.

108
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,534
Ooh!

109
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,576
Yeah, which is why I thought
you'd be a perfect assistant--

110
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,495
because you know where
all the bodies are buried.

111
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,247
And I even helped
bury some of them.

112
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,499
Maeby was only 17 at the time.

113
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,209
Also, um, can you buy me booze?

114
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,460
Totally.

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,505
(whispering):
Whatever else, too.

116
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:16,216
'Cause I can get you smack
or hash or Special K...

117
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:19,094
Unfortunately,
when Maeby was shooting

118
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:23,932
out of town on a picture,
Kitty saw to it...

119
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,976
She didn't even get releases
from her family.

120
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,519
that Maeby's was one
of the bodies that was buried.

121
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,312
And I begged her to.

122
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,440
And the project got thrown
on the back burner.

123
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,234
MICHAEL: Do you have any idea
why Ron Howard wants to see me?

124
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,570
Believe me, if I could
think like Ron Howard,

125
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,281
I'd own the second largest
building in Beverly Hills.

126
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,241
Only Jerry Bruckheimer's
building

127
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,993
was technically taller.

128
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:44,536
But who wants to be
south of Wilshire?

129
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,371
WOMAN:
Mr. Howard will see you now.

130
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:48,665
- Oh, great.
- I'll take you to the private elevator.

131
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:51,585
- Thanks.
- Ooh! Going to meet the big man himself.

132
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,713
But first, Michael would have
to pass a few little Rons.

133
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,006
Michael Bluth.

134
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,341
- Hey.
- Hey, nice try, mister.

135
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,343
We're never going
to beat the original.

136
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:01,928
- Well, that's what I've been saying.
- Hi. Hey.

137
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,555
- Oh, Michael. Hey, thanks
for coming down. - How are you?

138
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:05,098
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm just finishing up

139
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,391
casting this
Andy Griffith Show thing.

140
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,601
Okay. Yeah.

141
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,019
Hang on a second.

142
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:10,422
You guys finally
making that movie?

143
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,278
I've been reading about it
for, like, 40 years.

144
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,149
Well, it's not a done deal yet,

145
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,711
- but I want to talk about you.
- Yeah.

146
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,402
- Hey, let's go inside the LEM.
- (gasps)

147
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:19,404
- You want to?
- Wow. Is this the one

148
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:20,614
that landed on the moon?

149
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:21,990
On a soundstage.

150
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:23,492
Oh, right, from Apollo 13.

151
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,202
No, no, 1969.

152
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll tell you about it
inside the LEM.

153
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,663
It's soundproof in there.

154
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,582
And it's a national secret.

155
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:33,293
So, NASA did go to the moon
in '71.

156
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,087
That one was real.

157
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:37,380
But in '69, they weren't ready,

158
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:41,259
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of Gentle Ben.

159
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:42,385
- Boy.
- Me and my brother,

160
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,096
we hid up in the rafters.

161
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,514
- We seen the whole thing.
- Ah.

162
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,307
But I want to talk to
you about something.

163
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,017
Okay.

164
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,478
For the last year, I've
been going to Phoenix.

165
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,647
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, now.

166
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,148
Are you kidding me?

167
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,817
I'm a... I'm a Phoenix.

168
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,236
I've-I've never... I've never
met anyone else in person

169
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,557
that, uh...
that also goes there.

170
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,197
That's amazing.

171
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,449
I guess that's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

172
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,535
Well, I... I just got
a sick aunt down there.

173
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,703
- Oh, I see.
- But on the last flight,

174
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,497
I was flipping
through the magazine,

175
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,290
- and I... I saw something.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:14,126
Not-not...
not the begging photo.

177
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,752
Now, I don't think
you know this about me,

178
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:18,588
but most of my movies are based

179
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,674
on still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.

180
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,217
NARRATOR:
It was true.

181
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,177
Splash was based
on what turned out

182
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:26,263
to be a counterfeit Hockney

183
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,639
that Brian talked Ron
into buying.

184
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:32,102
The Da Vinci Code
was from this photo.

185
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:33,812
RON HOWARD:
You know Willow?

186
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:37,065
That was from a Soft 'n Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

187
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:39,109
But a man who is
passionate enough

188
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,528
to beg, well, that's a character

189
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,780
whose story we really want
to see.

190
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,615
- Really?
- Plus I've been dying to figure out

191
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,658
a way to do something
about the market crash

192
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,701
ever since my partner,
Brian Grazer, was tipped off

193
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,413
that it was three months
away from happening.

194
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,663
What's that?

195
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,499
But I never had a face
to put on it.

196
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,459
Until now. You.

197
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,503
Your wife is dying.

198
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,255
You're trying to hold
your family together.

199
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,090
Oh, gosh, no, no, no.

200
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:05,260
My wife died years before
any... any of this.

201
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,345
Oh, gee.

202
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,516
I think it's a lot more fun
if we see her die.

203
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,226
- That is fun.
- And by the way,

204
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:16,479
then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

205
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,232
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

206
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,483
Your girl?

207
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,693
Rebel Alley.

208
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:22,819
She's an actress.
You know her.

209
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,196
NARRATOR:
He didn't.

210
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,530
I do.
Yes, of course I do.

211
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,073
Your girl, huh?

212
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,367
Well, we kind of like
to keep that quiet.

213
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,744
Michael assumed
that by "my girl,"

214
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,370
Ron was referring
to his mistress...

215
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,539
I can see why you're
telling me in the LEM, huh?

216
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:38,293
...but Ron was actually
talking about his daughter.

217
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:41,463
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her to you.

218
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,381
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm not one to judge.

219
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:45,634
I'm sure you've all got girls
up here in Hollywood, huh?

220
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,802
Brian's got two boys.

221
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,641
I think you're a natural
and it could be a great movie.

222
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,226
You know, and-and
it's a real chance

223
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,518
to show you guys off, too.

224
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,770
Us guys?

225
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,231
Well, it's about
the whole family.

226
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,732
Them?

227
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,275
We're going to need
everybody's signature

228
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:05,153
on these releases in order
to make this story.

229
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:06,655
Although the real
heartbeat of this thing

230
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,156
is the father-son dynamic.

231
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,491
Yeah. You know, Ron,

232
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,409
I-I don't know if I can do this.

233
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,453
We're not in a great way
right now,

234
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:15,330
and-and it might not
be worth...

235
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,791
Michael, take a few of these
cards and really think about it.

236
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,793
- All right.
- Yeah, man, I got a tough meeting coming up now.

237
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,713
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

238
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,758
NARRATOR: And while Ed was
getting some bad news,

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,593
Michael got some good news.

240
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,220
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a mistake?

241
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:31,513
Am I a producer?

242
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,764
It's one of the perks

243
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,391
of having a movie
made about you.

244
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,309
Huh.

245
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,603
Health plan is not
another one, by the way.

246
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,647
There's no health plan.

247
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,110
NARRATOR: Michael had been given
an opportunity

248
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:48,238
to turn his life around,
and all he had to do

249
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,198
to make it happen was to get

250
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,075
- his family's signatures.
- ...the family signatures,

251
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,744
especially my father's.

252
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:56,162
BARRY:
Wow, sounds like your thing

253
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,497
went a lot better
than my thing.

254
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,292
Except I haven't spoken
to them for a long time.

255
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,503
I mean, since I...
well, since-since my mom...

256
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,130
Left?

257
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,756
Yeah, for prison, yeah.

258
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,258
You want to know what?

259
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,718
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

260
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,137
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

261
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,347
Oh, it sounds like Ron Howard
is casting with his (bleep).

262
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,182
Well...

263
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,144
it is hard to believe,
but I guess they've all got

264
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,479
their mistresses up here
in showbiz, you know.

265
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,273
It's like it's
their God-given...

266
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,400
Front?
No, right.

267
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,193
- No, right.
- Calm down, everybody, all right?

268
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,796
- I got it. I got it.
- You think my dad

269
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,530
would ever even go
for something like this?

270
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,824
You know, it's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

271
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,659
It's... it's like somebody
a long time ago said...

272
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,494
BOTH: Hey, what if you never
signed anything

273
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,371
because you said you didn't
have a signature?

274
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,623
- Just like you, Pop.
- You... you don't have a signature?

275
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,250
No, and he's never
given me one card.

276
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:43,668
Not one birthday
card, which is why

277
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,086
his presents are
always money orders.

278
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,296
Right, Pop?

279
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,423
- I don't have a signature.
- Oh!

280
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:50,258
If you don't sign,
you will be fine.

281
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,634
Hey.

282
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,178
He's very smart.

283
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,888
He's very good.

284
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,514
Can you feel your hands?

285
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,516
I can't feel my pinky
or this one.

286
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,268
MICHAEL: You know what, Barry?
I hear what you're saying.

287
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,187
I... My dad would never do
something like this for me.

288
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,730
I'm going to head back in,
and I'm going to...

289
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,565
I'm going to tell Ron Howard
to forget about it.

290
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:06,733
- Yeah, you're screwed.
Hey, do me a favor. - Yeah.

291
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:07,776
- Tell Ron Howard to go
- Okay.

292
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,378
- shove his... (bleep)
- Bye-bye, Barry.

293
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:11,696
- Oh!
- Sorry. Whoops.

294
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:12,781
Whoa. Sorry.
That was my fault.

295
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,407
- No.
- I was looking at my phone.

296
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,658
It's not too embarrassing
walking around

297
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,285
with a bunch of photographs
of yourself.

298
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:19,162
Oh, well, looks like
it's part of your job, huh?

299
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:22,207
- You're an actress?
- No, I'm a narcissist.

300
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,667
Yeah, actually, "actress"
is an overstatement because...

301
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,252
Ugh. Thank you.

302
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,380
I was just sucking at
this audition I went on.

303
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:31,383
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute clichés,

304
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,510
where a guy and a girl
just, you know...

305
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,720
they bump into each
other, and they...

306
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,680
they fall in love.

307
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,308
God, you're handsome.

308
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,560
I got a...
maybe a lucky hair day.

309
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:43,895
You're the beautiful one.

310
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,731
You have beautiful eyes.

311
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,776
My deceased wife had red hair.

312
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:51,694
Yep, garbage like that.

313
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:53,696
And it's so unbelievable.

314
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,299
Like, they never get
each other's names.

315
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,325
Pretty stupid. Whoops. Gosh.

316
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,285
- Oh... oh! Ow!
- Oh! Are you okay?

317
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,727
- That really hurt.
- Ooh. You okay?

318
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,414
I wish I had done that
well in the audition.

319
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:05,834
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

320
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,460
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

321
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,962
Yes, you, too.

322
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,464
I'm a "moobie" producer.

323
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:12,841
Sorry. I'm a movie...

324
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,300
Here, I've got...

325
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,302
I've got proof here, huh?

326
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,679
- Oh, you are a movie producer.
- Yeah.

327
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,597
Yeah, there's a part
for a wife,

328
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,599
and you'd be perfect
for the movie.

329
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:23,726
(chuckling)

330
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,687
Do you like Scottish music?

331
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,398
Uh, with the screeching horns
and the silly...

332
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,400
Yeah. I'm in a band.

333
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:32,235
I love it. It's great.

334
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,903
We're playing at the Ealing
Club tomorrow night, and...

335
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,946
maybe you could come and...
and just check it out.

336
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,948
Oh, yeah?
I don't even know what that is.

337
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,284
(laughing)

338
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:40,618
I should've... Sorry.

339
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,870
That's funny.
I should have said "where."

340
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,455
Of course, I know what it is.

341
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,039
No, it's on the top
of that building.

342
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,459
- Okay.
- But can you imagine driving that car?

343
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,752
No, I can't. No.

344
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,505
NARRATOR: It wasn't until
Michael had walked

345
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,049
two blocks past the
California Pizza Kitchen

346
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,551
when this happened.

347
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,428
♪ Hey, I met a girl today ♪

348
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,637
♪ And her name is... ♪

349
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,971
(bleep)

350
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,974
So Michael went back
to find her

351
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,057
or, at the very least,
try looking for a head shot

352
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,521
- with her name on it.
- Nothing, huh?

353
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:09,439
She was super-pretty,
red hair...

354
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,607
But even without her name,

355
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,650
he knew his only chance
with her

356
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:14,486
was to be a real producer,
and that meant

357
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,946
getting a signature
from a father whose face

358
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,947
he hadn't seen in ages.

359
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,282
LUCILLE 2:
Oh, you're making me dizzy!

360
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:20,950
And that's when he
suddenly did.

361
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,952
LUCILLE 2: We have
to keep this quiet!

362
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,746
Dad?

363
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,749
No, no.

364
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,792
- Hi.
- LUCILLE 2: Don't say I'm down here.

365
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,878
- Right here.
- Hey.

366
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,796
What's going on?

367
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,423
I just came back to get, uh...

368
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:36,674
LUCILLE 2 (whispering):
Don't acknowledge me.

369
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,468
...get some suits, you know,

370
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,720
so I can look like the uptight,

371
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:43,556
dishonest, cheating boob
that I am.

372
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,850
Well, I never said "boob."

373
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,936
Although you are in
the wrong Lucille's apartment,

374
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,355
so unless you're looking
for a Bob Mackie original,

375
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,898
could be some truth
to the cheating part.

376
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,566
Yeah, well, I was
in the desert,

377
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:54,943
and I've lost my
sense of direction.

378
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,585
- (clears throat)
- Hey. Where you going?

379
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:57,820
Dad.

380
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,448
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

381
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,658
Listen.

382
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,409
You're getting divorced.

383
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,578
I am not one to judge.

384
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,498
Great to see you again.

385
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,500
The past is the past, and
things have worked out,

386
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,544
and I've met a
wonderful woman named...

387
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:15,964
Don't worry about that,
but I'm a movie producer now.

388
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,840
Unbelievable.

389
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,510
They're making a movie
out of my life.

390
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:22,554
The girl I met is perfect
to play my wife.

391
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,347
And it's... I don't know.

392
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,474
Can you believe it?
And I know what you're thinking:

393
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,768
- "Can you put me in it?"
- I don't care.

394
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,019
Do I have what I hope I've got?

395
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,479
Anybody who's getting
in the movie

396
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,022
needs to sign this.

397
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,857
It's a simple signature.

398
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,442
I think that everybody
needs to see

399
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:37,819
who the real George
Sr. is, don't you?

400
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,365
I think it would all depend
on how George Sr. was portrayed.

401
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,866
Well...

402
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:48,913
he is not the most
positive character, but...

403
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:51,874
you sign this, and I
don't see any reason

404
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,044
why we can't make him
seem very, very, uh...

405
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,838
uh, you know...

406
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,424
uh...

407
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,426
uh...

408
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,386
uh...

409
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,977
...nice.

410
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,854
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

411
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,897
NARRATOR:
Michael was actually relieved.

412
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,065
You go to hell.

413
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,984
He had no idea how he was

414
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,028
going to make
his father seem nice.

415
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,324
NARRATOR: Michael Bluth
was starting his new life

416
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,368
as a producer in-- get this--
Beverly Hills

417
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,830
without the signature
he needed to make it happen.

418
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:33,458
Your office is only
one floor below Ron Howard's.

419
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,209
Oh, yeah?

420
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:38,212
Must be a pretty important
project to him, then, huh?

421
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,757
- That's one possibility.
- (bell dings)

422
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,800
Watch your head.

423
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,719
Are these ceilings
a little lower?

424
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,512
Brian and Ron
wanted the ceiling

425
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,265
in their office to be
a few inches taller,

426
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:51,225
but, apparently, Bruckheimer
knows someone on city council

427
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,227
and they wouldn't let them
make the building taller.

428
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,812
So Ron said,
"(bleep) you, Jerry,"

429
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,231
and he went lower
with his floor.

430
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,941
Everybody wins, huh?

431
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:01,402
- Here we are.
- Oh. That's me, huh?

432
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,780
Oh. Ceilings
are even lower in here.

433
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,699
Yeah, your office
is right below Brian's.

434
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,326
He wanted his ceiling

435
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:09,869
just a few inches
taller than Ron's.

436
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:11,913
- Okay.
- Some internal competition.

437
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,956
- Kind of like between us.
- Yeah.

438
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,377
- Wait, what?
- Well, you have a family to track down.

439
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,462
Yeah, I do.
Hey, speaking of that...

440
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:22,548
Kitty, is there... is there
a directory of actresses,

441
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,550
- with pictures in it, that I could...
- Wow.

442
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,511
Starting with the
casting couch already.

443
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,804
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

444
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,389
I met... I met this
unbelievable woman

445
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,265
that would be perfect
for the part of my wife.

446
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,850
And even if she isn't, I'd love

447
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:34,394
to track her down, so...

448
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,229
an actual couch could
be useful, please.

449
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,438
Okay, you're funny.

450
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,680
This is Imagine Entertainment,

451
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,692
not the hot tub
at Bruckheimer Tower.

452
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,485
We make family movies,

453
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:43,986
you (bleep) (bleep)
(bleep) pig.

454
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,239
- Okay.
- So, why don't you not worry

455
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,366
about casting your movie,
and instead just get

456
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,951
the rights to your family,
and, of course,

457
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,745
if you need any help at all,
I would love to help you.

458
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,580
- We like to pull together around here.
- Watch your back.

459
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,582
No, you watch your back, mister!

460
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,292
If you screw up
this project for me,

461
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,253
I will bury you
farther underground

462
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,463
than I did your illiterate
little niece!

463
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,298
Hi, guys.

464
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,509
NARRATOR: With Michael's movie
in jeopardy

465
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:09,929
over the rights,
he decided to call in a favor.

466
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,681
MICHAEL:
You know, we're making a movie

467
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,307
about the family, and I thought,

468
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,600
"I wonder if Carl Weathers

469
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,227
would be willing
to help me out."

470
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:18,396
- Let me ask you this right up front.
- Okay.

471
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:20,857
Do you think
anybody would be upset

472
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,276
if one of these Crinch
dolls took a walk?

473
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,820
No, no, no, no, help yourself.

474
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,363
I know what you're thinking.

475
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,490
"What part
would I play in this?"

476
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,534
I figured you'd
want me to play me.

477
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:34,036
Well, I... I didn't want
to waste you on you.

478
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,913
In fact, I wasn't even going
to talk to you about acting,

479
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:38,040
but if you are game,
boy, that would be great.

480
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,417
Let's circle back to that.

481
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,377
There's a television show,
was it,

482
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,880
that you made about my family.

483
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,883
NARRATOR: Michael was referring
to the George Bluth Sr. episode

484
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:50,094
of a horribly narrated
crime reenactment series

485
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,763
called Scandalmakers

486
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:53,848
that Carl had directed
years earlier.

487
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,267
Did you retain the rights
to my father's story?

488
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,894
Nah, man, rights cost money.

489
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,353
I never bothered
with that stuff.

490
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:00,563
I figure you go ahead,
you shoot it.

491
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,524
Better to ask for forgiveness
than beg for permission.

492
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:05,443
NARRATOR:
As it turned out, Carl

493
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,612
had never bothered
to get either,

494
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,405
which is why he made himself
the subject

495
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,866
of the final episode
of the series.

496
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:14,869
Lee Nails, only pressed on once.
(chuckles)

497
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:16,871
Carl, we're at a swap meet.

498
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:18,664
Okay.
There he is.

499
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,500
- Carl Weathers.
- Mr. Weathers-- Carl Weathers.

500
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,752
You've been accused
of producing a television show

501
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,796
based on real-life events
for which you've done

502
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,966
none of the due diligence
in securing the rights thereto.

503
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,676
I only have one question.

504
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,011
Can I have your rights?

505
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,513
- Of course.
- Of course, Carl Weathers.

506
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,889
CARL:
Cut!

507
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,724
Now we'll move on,
do a little voice-over.

508
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:37,850
How much are these belts?

509
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,685
- Oh, oh, oh, God.
- DeBrie!

510
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,437
Her heart stopped.
She's (bleep) dying.

511
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,648
Oh, hey, Dave,
you shaved, I like it.

512
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,107
Please get the paddles!

513
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,901
Oh, hey, Mike.
How was Ojai?

514
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:48,361
MICHAEL:
But, Carl, the whole point

515
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,029
of the movie is that
it's a true story,

516
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,113
so I need the rights.

517
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,657
- (laughing)
- Don't I?

518
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:56,035
Man, you're as green
as old lady Crinch.

519
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:59,330
Come on, people don't go
to movies to see rights.

520
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:01,415
People go to movies
to see actors.

521
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:03,459
Now, who you got
as scriptwriter?

522
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,544
NARRATOR: And that's
when Michael remembered

523
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,587
that he did know one member

524
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,673
- of the Writers Guild.
- The eye is falling off this one.

525
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,384
You mind if I swap it out,
you know, for the restaurant?

526
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,510
Swap it.

527
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:13,761
And I thought, who's going

528
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,638
to get it right the first time?

529
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,098
Because I don't want
to give a lot of notes.

530
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,724
And then it came to me.

531
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,435
Who knows my father better
than Warden Gentles?

532
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,814
Hold on one second.

533
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:26,816
"The first time."

534
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:27,942
Yeah.

535
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:28,984
My grandson gave me this,

536
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,862
but I guarantee you,
give me an old Royal

537
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,488
and a glass of Scotch,
and I'll give you

538
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,741
250 pages where
the lightning hits the tree.

539
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,702
- That's not what we do here.
- I mean,

540
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,911
where the drop hits the pond.

541
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,413
- That's it.
- I apologize.

542
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,664
I've had a few meetings today.

543
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:42,665
Then...

544
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,041
the yellow robot gets mad

545
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,459
at the pink robot--

546
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,044
- That does...
- correction...

547
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,588
the purple robot.

548
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,465
Sorry, I'm,
I'm back to back today.

549
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,550
I bet.

550
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:53,676
I'm gonna be honest with you.

551
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,844
You're not charring my tree,

552
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,388
and... yeah,

553
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,350
Jerry's not gonna come
off the boat for this one.

554
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,892
MICHAEL: This is basically
a story about

555
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,810
- Mm-hmm.
- a fellow like myself

556
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:04,061
- and his father
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,521
and their friend Carl Weathers.

558
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,148
I'm not entirely sure

559
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,610
how to organically work him
into the, to the story.

560
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,861
Uh, you know,
maybe he's teaching them

561
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:13,696
lessons or something.

562
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:16,032
Anyway, I'm gonna leave that
up to your capable hands.

563
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,868
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

564
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,994
I've turned it off again.

565
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:21,996
Yeah, those are tricky.

566
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,414
Might I suggest

567
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,499
bringing in someone younger
to play the father--

568
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,168
a Philip Seymour Hoffman type?

569
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,128
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.

570
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,129
And so, naturally,

571
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:31,505
I-I thought of you.

572
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,132
Well, you know,
I'm a married man,

573
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:34,759
so I don't really
keep a directory

574
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,636
of attractive young
actresses around.

575
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,596
- Okay.
- I mean, are you really planning

576
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:41,432
on using her, or is it like
Conan with the girl writers?

577
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:42,808
It doesn't matter, it...

578
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,477
I-I'm here to talk
to you about a movie

579
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,853
that we're gonna make
about the family,

580
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,146
and I thought
that it might be really fun

581
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,731
for us to work together again.

582
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:50,983
Help me remember.
What did we do together?

583
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,486
You came over for a chicken
and ham-water dinner

584
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,567
that my family threw to raise
some funds for itself.

585
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,031
And they're finally
getting around

586
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:58,741
to making a movie of that, huh?

587
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,034
There's more to it than that.

588
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:01,577
It's, it's about
a young man trying

589
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,080
to get out from under
his domineering father

590
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,922
while dealing
with the slow death of his wife.

591
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:07,667
That just saved me 12 bucks.

592
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,794
I'm not going to see it.

593
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,754
I'm not asking you to see it;
I'd like for you to be in it.

594
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:14,131
No offense, I have a job.
I mean, I have a good thing.

595
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,591
- Oh, hey, Mr. O'Brien.
- Hey, how's it going?

596
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,510
- Real good.
- Andy, quick note.

597
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,012
Uh, just 'cause I look at you
when we're doing the show

598
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,264
and ask you a question doesn't
mean you have to respond.

599
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,183
Sometimes it's funny
when you don't say anything,

600
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,644
and the audience gets
to think, "Hey,

601
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,145
Andy really is stupid."

602
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,271
(laughs)

603
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,982
- Gets a big laugh.
- (chuckles)

604
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,817
- Hey, you're new.
- I've been here a year.

605
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,986
(laughing):
And you're funny, too.

606
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,278
Let's get you set up
in a writer's office.

607
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,155
Oh, you can have Andy's
if you don't mind

608
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,949
the smell of bologna.

609
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,784
I'm in.

610
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:45,329
♪ You're simply the best... ♪

611
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:48,082
NARRATOR: Michael had assembled
his dream team,

612
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:50,793
and now it was time
to wow his boss.

613
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,396
Excuse me, sir,
could you turn that off,

614
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,379
please?

615
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:55,840
Oh, I thought
that was playing in here.

616
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,300
Sorry, it was a slide show
of my granddaughter's--

617
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,177
daughter's graduation
from college.

618
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,554
- Sure. - Michael.
- High school.

619
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,597
- Hi.
- Did you get the signatures?

620
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,142
Better-- I put together
the core team: acting

621
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,060
- and writing.
- ANDY: You guys do remember

622
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,730
I have to be back in Burbank
by 1:00 every day, right?

623
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,148
- We've got that, uh-huh.
- I'm looking forward to this.

624
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,941
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is happening.

625
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,735
- It is happening.
- It's happening.

626
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:16,777
Dude, you are moving
way too fast.

627
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,029
Maybe by Hollywood standards,

628
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,322
you know, but, Kitty, I come
from the business community,

629
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,367
where sometimes you have to
show it to him already built.

630
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,244
Still think
you're going to bury me?

631
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:28,372
Well, Michael, you may not
have your father's signature,

632
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:30,916
but you sure have
his signature style.

633
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,293
Cue the music.

634
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:36,172
I think I just deleted my pitch.

635
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,299
NARRATOR: As it turns out,
it wouldn't matter.

636
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,342
(elevator bell dings)

637
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,178
Uh-oh.

638
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,346
Hello, think there's a problem
with the elevator.

639
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,890
Do you have
a scheduled appointment?

640
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,292
N-No, we're here
to see Ron Howard.

641
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,351
This is the untitled
Michael B. project.

642
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,145
I'm actually a producer here.
How are you?

643
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,354
I've got the office
just below the sunken

644
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,773
living room there in Brian's.

645
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,274
We're here to pitch
Ron the movie.

646
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:56,817
I'm sorry, sir, this is
a restricted floor.

647
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,360
RON:
Louisa, it's all right.

648
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,780
For crying out loud,
I'm not the king of England.

649
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,948
- Ah, there he is, hey, Ron.
- Oh, did you get that signature?

650
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,742
You know, I've got
something better--

651
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,077
take a look.

652
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,828
Andy Richter?

653
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,955
I'm out, (bleep) it, I'm out.

654
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,665
Not married to Andy,

655
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,043
- but what I do have is the writer.
- Stephan Gentles,

656
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,295
Warden, East Orange County
Department of Corrections

657
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:20,216
and writer of multiple episodes
of Rocko's Modern Life.

658
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,884
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere.

659
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:24,762
(laughs)
As long as I don't end up there.

660
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:27,264
I'll have 25 pages on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

661
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,891
Gosh, that's

662
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,309
- putting the cart before the horse.
- Oh, yeah.

663
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,812
Loo-Look who I've got
to play Carl Weathers.

664
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:33,896
Oh, is that Cuba?

665
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,314
No, no, n-n-no,
that's not Cuba.

666
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,983
I did not want to
waste Cuba on Carl.

667
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,276
This is Carl Weathers.

668
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,195
Oh, sure, Carl.

669
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,030
You know, I thought it was Cuba

670
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:44,824
with the perfect
Carl Weathers makeup.

671
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,993
No, no, no, no, Cuba doesn't
have that kind of range.

672
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,411
The thing is,
I really do insist

673
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,705
- on controlling the casting myself.
- I get it. - I'm out.

674
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,948
I thought maybe if you just saw
the whole team together.

675
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,417
BRIAN:
Team, what team?

676
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,961
I should be informed
of all meetings.

677
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,337
Hey, Cuba, how you doing?

678
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,381
Oh, Brian, you know Carl
Weathers, Stephan Gentles,

679
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,174
Andy Richter,
and Michael Booth.

680
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,848
I'm gonna skip this one.

681
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,307
Good to see you, Brian.

682
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,393
You know, Ron, I think
it might be easier to talk

683
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,228
if we just come up
just the rest of the way.

684
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,479
Oh, thanks.

685
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,315
Yeah, the elevator's been kooky
since we lowered that floor...

686
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,151
but maybe
once you get that signature.

687
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,735
It might be kind of tricky.

688
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,112
They're all down
in Orange County.

689
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:25,072
- Tough to get down there.
- Oh, hey, B.

690
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:26,740
- Yeah. - We must have an office
down there somewhere.

691
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,783
Yeah, we'll stick you someplace.

692
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:28,868
Yeah.

693
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,035
We'll stick you someplace.

694
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:36,500
NARRATOR:
Michael was starting work

695
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,668
at his new show business office

696
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:41,088
- at Orange County Imagine.
- Charles Dawkins.

697
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,091
And his office was already
receiving a lot of visitors.

698
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,427
Don't get comfortable.
Sir, thank you, no.

699
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,761
But mostly because
of the sign's similarity

700
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,471
to that of this institution,

701
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,932
which also received
some confused visitors.

702
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,392
An embolism?

703
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:54,852
I-I was just here
to pitch a game show.

704
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:57,271
Go right out this way,
sir, thank you.

705
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:58,439
- But can I leave a sample?
- It's generous

706
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,482
of you, but they're gonna be
much better

707
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,735
with it down there at Imaging.

708
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,057
And that's when Michael got
his most unexpected visitor.

709
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,826
Dad, what are you doing here?

710
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:14,788
I wanted to speak
to you in person.

711
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,790
I think that you're
a little late, okay?

712
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,419
Because I went to you
for a simple signature,

713
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:23,088
not so I could just make
a movie about the family,

714
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,757
but so that I can move on
with my life,

715
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,675
and you told me to go to hell.

716
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,594
Yeah, you know, sometimes,
when I'm caught off guard,

717
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:30,930
I say things I don't mean.

718
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,640
This is a horrible
little office.

719
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,361
So you're here to apologize,
is that right?

720
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,353
Yes, and I, uh, brought
you a peace offering.

721
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,521
Tetas Gigantes?

722
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,689
You hate it, right?

723
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,149
Well, it's, it's Mexican porn.

724
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,693
You know, you are
impossible to buy for.

725
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:45,945
Just, uh, give it to me.

726
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,029
- No, no, oh.
- No, no, no, give...

727
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,906
- No, no, no.
- See, this is the (bleep) kayak

728
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:50,616
- all over again.
- Dad, I apologize.

729
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,576
I was saying it was
a very original gift.

730
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:53,743
No, no, no.
You'll never use it.

731
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,746
I will use it, except
for maybe Señor Señoritas.

732
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,624
I live in Mexico now

733
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,834
and I, I don't always
know how to ask

734
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,461
- exactly for what I want.
- Understandable.

735
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,088
And that's almost over now,

736
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:08,008
which is what I came
to talk to you about.

737
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,635
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

738
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:10,886
I know a lot of people, sure,

739
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,762
'cause I'm a big producer now.

740
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,390
- Yeah?
- He ate a mouse.

741
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,809
Let's grab a coffee.

742
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,560
Okay, so I guess things
haven't been going

743
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,020
that well for me.

744
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,481
And you didn't feel
you could tell me that?

745
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,773
That's why I haven't
heard from you?

746
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:25,693
I guess I was afraid
that if I admitted

747
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,069
Sudden Valley was a failure...

748
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,738
- Told you so.
- ...you might say, "I told you so."

749
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,992
Well, then, you don't
know me at all.

750
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,910
It's all right, it's my fault. I
bit off more than I could chew.

751
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,662
I mean, I lied
about being a big shot

752
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:39,832
to impress this girl
whose name I don't even know.

753
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,960
I've got this crazy idea
that I'm gonna turn into a star

754
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:45,587
with a film that I can't
get made 'cause I can't get

755
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,006
my own father's signature
on, on, on a release.

756
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,674
- It's like, you know...
- Shh, shh, shh...

757
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:53,053
I didn't know it was
about lying to a girl.

758
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,056
Give me the release.

759
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,474
You'd do this for me?

760
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,476
Of course I will.

761
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,478
NARRATOR: And so, with his
father's rights in hand,

762
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,522
Michael the producer headed up

763
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,983
to find his lady
"Cinderella Man"

764
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:07,609
at the Ealing Club,

765
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,445
an exclusive show business
hangout.

766
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,612
Ron Howard.

767
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,156
Oh, thank you.

768
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,742
No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi.

769
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,160
Oh, I remember.

770
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,911
I did it.

771
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:18,954
I got my father's signature.

772
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,581
You know, you said
you wanted to focus

773
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,915
on the father-son relationship,
and I love it.

774
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,625
Who's not going to
be able to relate

775
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:24,918
to a son standing up to
his self-centered father?

776
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,503
Sure.

777
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,005
But the father-son relationship
I was interested in

778
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:31,841
was not you and your father,
it was you and your son.

779
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:34,011
You're the father.

780
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:36,846
But that would make
my son the son.

781
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,098
Bingo.

782
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,808
NARRATOR:
Michael had to decide

783
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,977
whether being a producer
was worth invading

784
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:46,190
the privacy of a son who had
kicked him out for that reason.

785
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,733
I don't think I can do it.
I don't think I can go...

786
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,485
I can't go to my son.

787
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,861
That's, uh-- I just--
I don't even think

788
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,114
that it's worth it just to say
that I'm a producer, like...

789
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:55,491
- It's your call.
- Yeah.

790
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:59,453
Maybe the real estate business
will come around soon.

791
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,580
Will it?

792
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:05,459
I could never reveal that
information to a non-producer.

793
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,710
NARRATOR:
And then he heard something

794
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,878
that made him change his mind.

795
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,255
Michael?

796
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,674
Mr. Moobie Producer.

797
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:13,926
That's me.

798
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:19,598
NARRATOR:
And like all bagpipe music,

799
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,017
it was hard to tell if it was
good music played horribly

800
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,853
or horrible music played well,

801
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,563
but Michael was eager
to find out

802
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,774
her name
when she was introduced

803
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,609
at the end of the set.

804
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,070
And tonight on bagpipes...

805
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,155
(goat bleats)

806
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,285
NARRATOR:
But he got to know her anyway.

807
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,246
Fantastic.

808
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,039
I'm only doing this
in between movies,

809
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,792
which, given how badly I bombed
at that audition yesterday,

810
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,544
it's going to be a while.

811
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,919
Yeah, you shouldn't worry
about that, you're gonna get

812
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,547
something.
You know, sometimes

813
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,257
even students make films.

814
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,758
(laughs)

815
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,510
Yeah, that's really funny.

816
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,554
I just could put
your name in for something.

817
00:27:58,595 --> 00:27:59,680
I do know Ron Howard.

818
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,974
(laughs)

819
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,725
Love that I make you laugh.

820
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,894
You seriously would be
great for this part.

821
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,771
You remind me of the person
that, that it's based on.

822
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:10,190
Uh, she, she actually
dies on camera.

823
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:11,191
Wow.

824
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,776
Make her mentally challenged

825
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,111
and I'll thank you
in my Oscar speech.

826
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,320
There's a part like that, too,

827
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,281
only she-she comes in later

828
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,159
and she's British,
so she doesn't seem...

829
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,994
No one could ever tell
that she's disabled.

830
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,996
I haven't been in work mode
for a while to be honest.

831
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,665
I've been, I've been
raising my son.

832
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,041
Oh, you have a son?
I have a son.

833
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,710
- You do?
- Oh, yeah, we've got a little issue,

834
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:30,711
though, right now.

835
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:31,879
Let me guess.

836
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,255
He's pushing you away?

837
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,215
- Yes.
- My son practically

838
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,259
kicked me out of his school
the other day.

839
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,761
That is literally
what my son did to me.

840
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,221
Then I said to him,

841
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:42,973
"You have no privacy from me."

842
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,683
That's what I should do.

843
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:45,976
Lem's six in August.

844
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:46,977
Yours?

845
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,854
- Seven in July.
- Aw...

846
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,147
NARRATOR:
Michael regretted the lie,

847
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,149
so he sort of split
the difference.

848
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,693
Teen-- 17

849
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:55,903
- in July.
- Oh.

850
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,279
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

851
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:59,656
Oh, wow.

852
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,284
Well, I guess you got to move
on with your life sometime.

853
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,704
Yes.

854
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:09,082
Yes, you do.

855
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,084
Oh, n-no, you know what?

856
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,004
I don't think that this
is-- it's not a good idea.

857
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,797
This is a great idea.
Why don't you think this is

858
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,341
- a great idea?
- 'Cause people can see.

859
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,218
- Nobody can see.
- Oh, God.

860
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,220
Wow, you weren't kidding

861
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,639
when you said you had
a part for me.

862
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,224
- That was absolutely insane.
- Thanks.

863
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,601
I've never done anything
that crazy before.

864
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:28,769
- Perfect.
- I want to do a lot more of that.

865
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,895
I want to see you again.

866
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,730
I want to take you out
to a nice dinner.

867
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,065
- Oh.
- So, then, uh...

868
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,984
Well, this will have
to tide you over until then.

869
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,778
Oh, look at those.

870
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,154
Boy, without this, I wouldn't
know you had a tattoo.

871
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:40,405
Oh, anyone that gets
that much clothing

872
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,324
off me better know my name.

873
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,367
(moans)

874
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,744
- Good night.
- Good night.

875
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:50,791
NARRATOR: And that's when
Michael finally saw her name.

876
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,376
Oh, my God.

877
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,755
I'm dating
Ron Howard's girlfriend.

878
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,924
NARRATOR:
Actually she's his daughter.

879
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:02,469
But that's kind of worse,
don't you think?

880
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,267
Michael starts
to really learn the business.

881
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:09,977
We can keep going around
another 20 minutes, if you want,

882
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,353
but I know what
I'm talking about.

883
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,981
I just went through this
last week with a guy.

884
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,857
That is a hernia.

885
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,442
I'm gonna send you to my guy
over at Hoag Hospital.

886
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:18,860
They call him the
Bulge Whisperer.

887
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,238
He does 20 of these a week.

888
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,282
NARRATOR: And after failing to
get back to Burbank on time,

889
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,117
Andy calls in a favor

890
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,743
from his identical
quintuplet brother Rocky.

891
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,787
All right, my next guest
is a famous pilot

892
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:32,207
who safely crashed his plane
into the Hudson River.

893
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:33,792
That's kind of a
coincidence, Andy.

894
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,295
We've got a pilot
who crashes planes,

895
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,298
and you're an actor
who crashes pilots.

896
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,217
And Rocky hurts two nice
red-haired guys' feelings...

897
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,011
Yeah, that's really funny.

898
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,846
You know what else
would be funny?

899
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,764
If I ripped that red rug
right off your head

900
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,392
and turned you into Ron Howard.

901
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,802
...while getting the biggest
laugh of Andy's career.

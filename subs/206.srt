1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,687
<i>Michael was using</i>
<i>the Bluth Company crane...</i>

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,021
<i>to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand</i>
<i>after it had been dumped in the bay...</i>

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,960
<i>a holiday tradition</i>
<i>among the local youth.</i>

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,863
- <i>Soon he returned home so that he and his son</i>-
- George Michael?

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,367
<i>Could share</i>
<i>their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.</i>

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,937
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the president now.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,237
I'm filling Dad's shoes...
literally, except his shoes don't fit.

12
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,607
But I did finally get
into Dad's pants...

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,806
although I had to have
the crotch taken in a little.

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,611
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits,
but I think you may be beginning...

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,812
to alienate some
of the employees down at work.

16
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,446
What? Oh, that's great.

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,993
The president has to worry
about alienating the employees now.

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,621
<i>In fact, Gob</i> had <i>started</i>
<i>to alienate some ofhis colleagues.</i>

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,464
The worst that could happen is I could
spill some on my $3,000 suit. Come on!

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,436
- Hey!
- The guy in the $4,000 suit...

21
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,406
is holding the elevator for the guy
who doesn't make that in three months.

22
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,811
Why don't I just take a whiz
through this $5,000 suit?

23
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,440
Come on! They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight...

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,951
when they toast me at the Christmas party,
just like they used to with Dad.

25
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,214
They used to <i>roast</i> Dad
'cause they thought that...

26
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,257
he had a sense of humor about himself,
but he didn't, and neither do you.

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,418
Hey, nobody laughed louder
than me at any joke about Dad.

28
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,464
<i>You're the one who's all Mr.</i>
<i>"I take myself too seriously all the time."</i>

29
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,433
<i>Michael did tend to take</i>
<i>the Christmas party somewhat seriously.</i>

30
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,834
Merry Christmas. You can go ahead
and put that right in the charity barrel.

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,737
Thanks a lot. Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.

32
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,903
<i>I know some of the numbers haven't all</i>
<i>added up, and there is some speculation...</i>

33
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,812
that George has been into the kitty-

34
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,111
"Into the kitty"! That's awesome.

35
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,882
Fire Tom
and get your jackass brother out of here.

36
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,618
This year I'm not officially president,
and it'll be nice to actually have some fun...

37
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,990
with my son
at a Christmas party.

38
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,893
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.

39
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,795
I wanna meet someone there.

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,232
What? So I'm not invited to
the Bluth Company Christmas party?

41
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,965
Oh, honey, of course
you can go if you want to.

42
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,133
- Thanks, Mom.
- No. You're not going to that.

43
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,735
You see, if I show up with you,
it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.

44
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,508
- I've never thought of you that way.
- That's sweet.

45
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:34,849
<i>Well, I won't be going. I will</i>
<i>be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01...</i>

46
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,888
in case the Blue Man Group
needs their understudy, so-

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,481
No, no, you have to go.
So when men find out...

48
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,924
we're in an open relationship,
they'll see you're no threat.

49
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:46,089
People hear the name Tobias,
they think big, black guy.

50
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,724
Well, obviously I'm not a big guy.

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,429
I'm not a Carl Weathers, <i>par exemple.</i>

52
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,701
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?

53
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,675
Hey, George Michael, I need you
to help me fix up the banana stand.

54
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,178
No, I can't. I was supposed
to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.

55
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,876
- We're makin' yams.
- Tonight? Tonight is the office party.

56
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,852
Well, did you want me to go to that? You're
always telling me not to have fun at those things.

57
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,186
Yes. We might even
snatch a gift from the charity barrel.

58
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:16,854
Oh. Okay, well-well, I think Ann's parents
are having their party on Bethlehem time...

59
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,022
which is pretty early,
so maybe I can make an appearance.

60
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,260
Make an appearance?
Uh- Uh- No, no. It's okay.

61
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,132
- You be with Yam. It's fine. It's good.
- It's Ann.

62
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,536
It's good. Have fun.

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,167
<i>The boy's pulling away from you.</i>
<i>Are we having yams?</i>

64
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,212
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.

65
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,248
He's spending every moment
of the day with this girl.

66
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,216
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

67
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,756
Don't get involved. Believe me. When
I thought your first wife was driving us apart...

68
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,824
I did not make a stink.

69
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:50,555
You complained all the time,
and she was my only wife. And she died.

70
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,826
Well, see, things have a way
of working themselves out.

71
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,731
Nonetheless, it's family first at the holidays.

72
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,566
- Oh, God. It's Mom again.
- <i>Put it on speakerphone.</i>

73
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,140
I wanna hear
her beautiful voice.

74
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,972
Michael! There's a hole in the window!
There's been a break-in!

75
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,308
- Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.

76
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,381
Sounds tense.

77
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,851
That means she's not gettin' any
from my brother, Oscar. Lovely. That's nice.

78
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,191
I heard about the banana stand,
and now there's been a break-in.

79
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,625
But I have a surprise
for whoever it is if he comes back.

80
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,254
First I blow him;
then I poke him.

81
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,334
Guy has no idea
what he's in for.

82
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:33,133
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be
on the outside. Plus, here's your little statue...

83
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:37,175
<i>so I guess what this says to me is,</i>
<i>I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.</i>

84
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,269
If anything, someone was trying
to break out. Where is Oscar?

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,781
Well, he's on his walkabout
or pilgrimage.

86
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,444
<i>Every year,</i>
<i>Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk...</i>

87
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,215
<i>from Newport Beach</i>
<i>to Berkeley, California.</i>

88
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,121
<i>In the 12 years</i>
<i>he's attempted this...</i>

89
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,992
<i>he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.</i>

90
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,554
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him...

91
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,135
to score his pot
and wag his pickle at coeds.

92
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,399
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough
to throw one of these little lady heads at him.

93
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,602
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely...

94
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,144
and you're acting out
for attention.

95
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,306
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.

96
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,352
What? No. No. No.
No, no, no, no.

97
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,752
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?

98
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,223
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child
to give herself company.

99
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,990
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?

100
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:35,932
I sent him to the Milford Academy to
teach <i>him</i> a lesson. I can't remember about what.

101
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,027
And Buster left this morning
to finish his army training.

102
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,768
<i>In fact, Lucille had refused</i>
<i>to drive him to the army base...</i>

103
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,777
<i>so Buster was taking</i>
<i>his very first bus ride.</i>

104
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,279
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.

105
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,619
Oh, God. Oh.

106
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,054
<i>And that's when Buster</i>
<i>saw something interesting.</i>

107
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,420
That could be good for army.

108
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,396
<i>Whilejust 20 yards away,</i>
<i>Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.</i>

109
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,367
What are you doin' here?

110
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,872
My mom signed me out of school early,
so she wouldn't have to pick me up later...

111
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,033
so she wouldn't be late
for the Christmas party.

112
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,771
- That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I had to drive...

113
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,076
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No. That's it.

114
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,879
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah. Well, thanks.

115
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,046
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old
to hang out with his dad.

116
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,057
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old
for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?

117
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,559
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?

118
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,289
Yeah. You're my little niece. I think
we should be spending more time together.

119
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,892
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back
to his precious Ann.

120
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,630
Great. Good deal.

121
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,779
<i>Michael and Maeby stopped</i>
<i>by the office to see if Gob needed help...</i>

122
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,943
<i>for the party</i>
<i>that was now hours away.</i>

123
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,748
...king $6,300 suit!

124
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,187
- Come on!
- Hi there.

125
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:10,160
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.

126
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,926
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids
getting their sticky fingers...

127
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,933
all over these $2,600 pants.

128
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,094
Oh, yeah? You think
they're gonna go right for the pants?

129
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:23,267
Okay, okay, okay. So, should-
should- should- should, should, should-

130
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,369
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,607
<i>We'll do it your way.</i>
<i>I'm just here to have fun.</i>

132
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,809
Not too much fun, all right? I already
gave my big sexual harassment speech today.

133
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,218
And please refrain from
discussing or engaging...

134
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,223
in any sort of interoffice-

135
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,816
<i>Or-</i>
<i>Or finger-</i>

136
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,954
Or- fisting
or-

137
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:51,003
Or even- even though
so many people in this office are begging for it.

138
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:55,005
And if anybody does anything
with my sister Lindsay...

139
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:59,476
<i>I'll take off my pants,</i>
<i>I'll shave-</i>

140
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,809
And I'll personally-

141
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,007
- Let's get this going.
- What are you talking about?

142
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,676
Now? You're not gonna let these people
go home and change their clothes?

143
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,187
I don't think we need people tryin'
to compete with what I'm wearing.

144
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,316
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.

145
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:19,228
Here we go. Let's go.

146
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,692
Everybody dance now.

147
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,069
Everybody dance <i>now.</i>

148
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,672
I think we're off
to a great start.

149
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:36,009
<i>And so, Michael started</i>
<i>to become relaxed, and a short time later...</i>

150
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,140
<i>his mother arrived anything but.</i>

151
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,277
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone. All of it- gone.

152
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,413
<i>In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day...</i>

153
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,617
<i>to cut down on the cost</i>
<i>of the party.</i>

154
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:51,186
- Hey, need a hand with that?
- No, Al. I wanna spill booze all over my f-

155
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,698
- I'm all alone there, Michael.
- You know, Buster's only
stationed about five miles away.

156
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,735
<i>In fact, Buster never went to the army.</i>

157
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:02,740
<i>He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane</i>
<i>and missed his first day.</i>

158
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,869
- <i>Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere</i>
<i>to go, he returned home.</i>
- Hey, Buster.

159
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,539
Buster!

160
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,313
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.

161
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,287
A coward? I'm not a coward.

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,951
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?

163
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,655
These are my awards, Mother,
from army.

164
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,994
The seal is for marksmanship...

165
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,398
and the gorilla is for sand racing.

166
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,631
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.

167
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,073
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're
putting me in something called Hero Squad.

168
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,408
You have no idea what it's like
to be abandoned by your son.

169
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,005
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.

170
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:48,746
How the worm has turned.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.

171
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,448
Mother, you have
to receive something to be ungrateful.

172
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,526
I'm not gettin' worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.

173
00:09:54,627 --> 00:10:00,065
Good. I'll get a drink and then go home
and wait for you to come stay with me.

174
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,760
Thank God they've got my brands here.

175
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,802
<i>This was an unacceptable solution.</i>

176
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:10,774
Hey, Tobias, it's Michael. I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.

177
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,106
<i>Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call...</i>

178
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,112
<i>and it went through</i>
<i>to Michael's home voice mail.</i>

179
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,444
The Blue Men!

180
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,951
<i>You have</i>
<i>101 unheard messages. First message.</i>

181
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,022
- Michael, it's your mother-
- Michael, pick up.

182
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,114
Happy Thanksgiving- Michael, it's Mother-

183
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,125
Michael, pick up-

184
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,685
- Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
- Bluth Company.

185
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,233
<i>And Lindsay showed up</i>
<i>at the Christmas party.</i>

186
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:40,795
<i>Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees</i>
<i>had been threatened against flirting.</i>

187
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:45,309
Oh, hello, Ted. Oh, if you're worried
about my husband, it's fine.

188
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:49,973
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout. You could
take him, and you could certainly take me.

189
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,813
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.

190
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,250
Hey, you guys are
sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
- Shh.

191
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,057
Go away.
You're gonna ruin it.

192
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,730
Aunt Lindsay,
how's the party?

193
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,325
It is the worst Christmas party
I've ever been to in my life.

194
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,031
Yeah. Watch this.

195
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,008
Yep. Like my last 10 years. And my daughter
won't give me the time of day.

196
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,670
- How was your party?
- Oh, it was good.

197
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,841
They're kind of religious,
Ann's family, so it was-

198
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,441
Yeah, it was just kind of-

199
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:31,080
<i>The word George Michael</i>
<i>was searching for was "creepy."</i>

200
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,934
Let me give you a hand
with that, little fella.

201
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,204
Hey, I was talkin' to the sound guy,
and he said he's got this karaoke thing.

202
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,906
- Yeah. Let's do it. Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.

203
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,882
Okay? Thanks very much.
Hey. I thought you were at your party.

204
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,578
No, no. They said I could leave
for the second hour of silent prayer.

205
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,453
But Ann and I do have to go back,
so I should- I should go soon.

206
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,617
- Uncle Michael-
- Okay. I'll be right there.

207
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,219
Sorry. I gotta go do this.
I'll be right back.

208
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,788
<i>And Michael</i>
<i>sang a duet with his niece.</i>

209
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,631
My daughter doesn't need me.

210
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,799
Neither does my dad.

211
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,207
<i>Had George Michael</i>
<i>and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered...</i>

212
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,773
<i>what Michael and Maeby did</i>- <i>that</i>
<i>"Afternoon Delight"was more adult-themed...</i>

213
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,079
<i>than its innocent melody</i>
<i>would have you believe.</i>

214
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,586
- Hang on, Maeby.

215
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,462
Listen. I'm gonna
go get some more punch, because it is toast time.

216
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:51,969
<i>Okay? No, no, no.</i>
<i>It'll look worse. Go that way.</i>

217
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,097
So, let's toast me.
Who's first?

218
00:12:55,207 --> 00:13:00,770
Huh. Tom, why don't you come up here
and talk about me for a few minutes?

219
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,111
Uh, I wanna thank
the Bluth family for hiring me back.

220
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,446
It's been a tough couple years.

221
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,282
- My brother did that. Talk about me.
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

222
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,949
Uh, you certainly
do love those suits.

223
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:17,654
<i>At seven grand, you'd better believe I love 'em.</i>
<i>I mean, look at what you're wearing.</i>

224
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,164
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is-

225
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,565
Who did this?

226
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,137
You do this, Tom?

227
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,799
- No.
- You're a real smart-ass. You know that, Tom?

228
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,843
Look, I don't know him very well...

229
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,005
but Gob seems like
he'd be a really smart boss.

230
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,640
Please don't laugh.

231
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,312
Look, he's a great magician.

232
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,857
<i>- That's even better!</i>
- you, Tom.

233
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,085
- Please don't.
- You know what? You're fired.

234
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,426
No. You're all fired,
each and every one of you.

235
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,897
Merry Christmas.

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,197
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody goin'?

237
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,329
- We don't work here anymore.
- What?

238
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,408
Is your sister still around?

239
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,814
<i>The Christmas party had been a disaster.</i>

240
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,410
I did the right thing, Michael. If I don't
fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?

241
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,925
- There are no others. You fired everyone.
- Oh, that- that's great.

242
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,520
The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece
is gonna tell the guy in the $3,600 suit...

243
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,065
how to run the business.

244
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,465
- Come on.
- I know. Maybe we're better off...

245
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,131
with me being businesslike and you
being the good-time, useless party guy.

246
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,209
- It got us this far.
- Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,405
And I must say that I miss the laughter.
Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me.

248
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,243
At you. We gotta figure out a way
to hire everybody back.

249
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,250
- A meeting.
- A party.

250
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,219
- No. We just had a party.
- Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun.

251
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,119
<i>So Michael went to work</i>
<i>on another Christmas party...</i>

252
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,057
<i>this time with the help</i>
<i>ofhis niece.</i>

253
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,754
<i>I appreciate you doing this.</i>
<i>I didn't wanna ask George Michael.</i>

254
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,663
Did you see that he showed up at the party
for five minutes and left without saying good-bye?

255
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,396
- Hey, my mom doesn't even wanna
be in the same room with me.
- Michael...

256
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,701
I was almost attacked
last night in my own home.

257
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,934
I walk in, and there's a colored man
in my kitchen.

258
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,137
- "Colored"? What color was he exactly?
- Blue.

259
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,579
Hello, Lucille.

260
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,420
- I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
- Well, he did a terrible job.

261
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:27,925
Didn't he? I need someone else, someone better.
What about this one? She's got thick arms.

262
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,155
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.

263
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,458
How am I supposed
to calm down?

264
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,763
Sounds tense. That means she's not
gettin' any from my brother Oscar.

265
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,065
<i>Maybe I should move in with you.</i>

266
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,005
<i>And Michael realized</i>
<i>he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.</i>

267
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,372
How would you like
to go on a road trip?

268
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,344
No. I wanna stay here
with her. Let's go.

269
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,314
<i>And so the two of them</i>
<i>prepared to drive up the coast.</i>

270
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,217
You're in charge of the radio, and we're
not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar.

271
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,449
There he is.

272
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:04,052
My mom is very stressed out,
and she needs something that I can't give her-

273
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,621
um, maybe a little
afternoon delight.

274
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,964
<i>Oscar thought that Michael</i>
<i>was referring to a particular brand of cannabis...</i>

275
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,404
<i>named Afternoon Deelite,</i>
<i>a strain famous for slowing behavior.</i>

276
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,374
<i>Well, sure. The question is...</i>

277
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,470
which way do I try
to get it in her?

278
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,049
I don't need any details.

279
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,516
- Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
- Hey!

280
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,918
- What happened to you?
- What?

281
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:36,518
<i>Oh, oh. My ears. The doctor said</i>
<i>I can't go to sleep for five hours...</i>

282
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,597
or I might die or something.

283
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,657
Oh, I got blown,
so I can't sleep.

284
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,701
<i>Hey, have you seen Maeby?</i>

285
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,934
You're not gonna believe this. Apparently
my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.

286
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,535
- You're kidding me.
- <i>Uh-oh. I should not have picked at that.</i>

287
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,739
- <i>That's blood.</i>
- This is ridiculous.

288
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,579
- So she's got a new parent.
- Yeah. Now my dad's got a new kid.

289
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:05,351
I'm gonna lie down for a little bit,
but just- I c- I can't fall-

290
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,929
Hey, how would you like
to come to the party with me today?

291
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,932
<i>And Oscar was giving Lucille</i>
<i>a little Afternoon Deelite.</i>

292
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,470
- These are really delicious.
- I'll get some more.

293
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,629
<i>Okay</i>

294
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,073
<i>Mm-hmm</i>

295
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,111
Where did she go?

296
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,273
<i>Soon, the second Bluth Company</i>
<i>Christmas party in as many days began.</i>

297
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,409
- You are not fired, sir.
- I really appreciate that.

298
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,886
You got it. Here you go. Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?

299
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,549
<i>Sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.</i>

300
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,424
- Come on!
- Hi.

301
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,764
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, don't be mad at me...

302
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,996
'cause you didn't think
about going out to Tarzana...

303
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,005
to get the old banana suit
out of storage.

304
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,565
<i>But it's worth it, because it's time for me</i>
<i>to make people laugh again.</i>

305
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,611
With me.

306
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,580
And what's funnier than a guy in-
Oh- Hey, wait. Hey.

307
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,545
Okay.

308
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,849
<i>Later, Gob was inside the banana stand...</i>

309
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,159
<i>and it was getting pretty hot in there,</i>
<i>so he decided to lose a layer.</i>

310
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,634
<i>Hey, look. There's your mom and George Michael.</i>
<i>I guess they did come to support us after all.</i>

311
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,364
Look at that. They're all over each other
with their little secrets.

312
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,465
- What can you do, right?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,602
How would you feel
about singing a little karaoke?

314
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,341
<i>Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there</i>
<i>to see all of Michael and Maeby's song...</i>

315
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,815
<i>and was about</i>
<i>to have a similar revelation.</i>

316
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,852
Could not be caught
that didn't bite

317
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,117
But you got some bait
a-waitin', and I think I might

318
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,715
- <i>Try nibbling a little afternoon delight</i>
- That's my wife and nephew.

319
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,956
- <i>Skyrockets in flight</i>
- We have an open relationship.

320
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:57,001
<i>Just then, Lucille arrived,</i>
<i>craving a frozen banana.</i>

321
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,163
<i>And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's</i>
<i>"Afternoon Delight"was overshadowed</i>-

322
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,367
- Mom?
- <i>by the effects of Oscar</i>
<i>and Lucille's Afternoon Deelite.</i>

323
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,968
- Tobias-Tobias, watch out.
- <i>Tobias couldn't hear</i>-

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,742
- Tobias!
- <i>and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.</i>

325
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,874
What the hell was that?

326
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,251
<i>And Gob couldn't move freely.</i>
<i>Lucille tried to stop...</i>

327
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,324
<i>but the car</i>
<i>hit Gob's banana peel.</i>

328
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,090
I can't get out of here. I'm stuck.

329
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,497
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.

330
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,935
<i>Hey, Mikey, relax.</i>
<i>It's just a giant banana.</i>

331
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,998
<i>And that's when Buster</i>
<i>saw an opportunity to be a hero.</i>

332
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,203
- Gob?
- Mom, I'm stuck!

333
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,213
I got you, Brother!

334
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,994
<i>And for the second time</i>
<i>since he became president...</i>

335
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,858
<i>Gob heard the sweet sound</i>
<i>oflaughter.</i>

336
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:04,698
They're laughing with me, Michael.
They're laughing with me!

337
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,136
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Buster's newfound skills...</i>

338
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,233
<i>did not involve</i>
<i>lowering gently.</i>

339
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,438
<i>Ooh. Oh.</i>

340
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,549
<i>Hey, it's Tobias.</i>
<i>Who wants to take me to the hospital?</i>

341
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,248
<i>And so father and son reunited...</i>

342
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,292
<i>rebuilding the banana stand</i>
<i>for a second time.</i>

343
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,453
- Hey. Can I give you a hand?
- <i>Hey. Yeah.</i>

344
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,397
- That would be great.
- Okay.

345
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,869
- Oh, I'm sorry about-
It's embarrassing, the whole-
- Listen, I, uh-

346
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,304
I've been a little out of line lately.
You're entitled...

347
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,841
to be with your girlfriend,
and I guess I got a little bit jealous.

348
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,912
- Yeah. Well, me too.
- Yeah.

349
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,709
Okay.

350
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,820
- Gonna grab some afternoon-
- Afternoon

351
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,485
- It does not seem like it would be that dirty.
- It's- It is catchy.

352
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,925
Right. That's the thing.

353
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,964
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

354
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,193
<i>The Blue Man Group finally calls for Tobias...</i>

355
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,136
<i>With a life-changing opportunity.</i>

356
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:18,266
<i>Unfortunately, he can't hear it,</i>
<i>and his life stays the same.</i>

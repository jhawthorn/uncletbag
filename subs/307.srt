1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,003
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,507
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,144
<i>Michael Bluth paid an
unexpected visit to his mother.</i>

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,382
- You look pretty, Mom.
- What do you need?

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,016
- Need? Why do you think I need something?
- Well, you're too busy for us.

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,527
No one's seen you.
Going on all those dates with Rita.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,963
- Or should I say playdates?
<i>- Michael had recently dated a woman...</i>

10
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,558
<i>he later found out
was mentally challenged.</i>

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,194
We're not seeing each other anymore,
but it's... it's for the best.

12
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,205
I'm actually kind of relieved it's over.

13
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,640
<i>Actually, Michael
had been so devastated by their break-up...</i>

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:49,875
<i>that he'd even broken out the old guitar.</i>

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,383
- Maybe you should talk to someone.
- Like my mom?

16
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,052
I don't know.
Does she play guitar?

17
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,960
Can't a guy call his mom pretty
without it seeming strange?

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,193
Amen. And how about that
little piece of tail on her?

19
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,929
- Cu-ute!
- I've opened a door here that I regret.

20
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,505
Oh, he's just talking about
his stupid turtle.

21
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,074
- Oh.
- She has a name, Mother. And it's "Mother."

22
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,770
<i>Buster had recently brought home a turtle...</i>

23
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:22,473
<i>in an incredibly misguided attempt
to make his mother jealous.</i>

24
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,712
You can stay in this box
that Uncle-father Oscar left behind.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,654
<i>- In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally
obtained medical marijuana.</i> - Oh, good.

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,749
- Hey, it's already got grass.
<i>- Primo bud. Real sticky weed.</i>

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,421
Although I was getting a little worried because
she was moving really slowly last week...

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,761
and then she stopped.
Hmm.

29
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,768
Yeah. Well, in any event I'm here,
Mom, because you need me.

30
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,067
As you know the Bluth Foundation dinner
is a week away.

31
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,303
I am your co-chair,
and we don't wanna relive the TBA debacle.

32
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,005
<i>Years earlier, the Bluths had a hard time...</i>

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,606
<i>agreeing on a cause
for their foundation's first fund-raiser.</i>

34
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,153
"Herpes." "Shrinkage."

35
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,280
Somebody saw <i>Seinfeld</i> last night.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,690
"Neck flap."
"Ovarian cancer." Gee, I wonder who that was?

37
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,625
- One more for "neck flap."
- Yes.

38
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,529
Well, I'll be honest. I haven't
heard anything that beats herpes.

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,898
<i>So, they sent out invitations with the disease...</i>

40
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,903
<i>still "to be announced."</i>

41
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:24,170
<i>And much to their surprise,
the Bluths ended up raising over $25,000...</i>

42
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>to fight TBA.</i>

43
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,912
<i>And then...
and here's the really horrible part...</i>

44
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,449
<i>they did it again
the following year.</i>

45
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,987
Keep fighting, little guy.
With your support of the Bluth Foundation...

46
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,252
we'll live in a galaxy
where TBA does not exist.

47
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,692
When people at the last gala found out,
we almost had a riot on our hands.

48
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,356
Well, you don't have to worry
about anything like that this year, because...

49
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,264
Warden Gentles is the new co-chair.

50
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,668
- The guy who ran Dad's prison?
- He's here now installing cameras...

51
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,104
because of all your father's escape attempts.

52
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,304
Uh, yeah. It looks like I won't be goin' anywhere
for a little while. But what do I care, huh?

53
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,939
I got a beautiful wife.
I got a wonderful hobby. Ha! Look at me.

54
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,949
I'm having the time of my life.

55
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,952
<i>His hobby was making papier-mâché copies...</i>

56
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:12,047
<i>- of his own head.</i> - Before I forget,
do you know if these cameras are high def?

57
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,061
I certainly hope so. It'll help me
better understand "George Bluth"...

58
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:23,102
the main character of the latest and, I pray,
final draft of my screenplay, <i>New Warden.</i>

59
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,865
- You wrote a screenplay, huh?
- I promised myself I wasn't gonna become...

60
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,873
one of those people who are always going on
about their screenplays...

61
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,935
so I'll just say, I put together a staged reading
with some fabulous young actors...

62
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,015
and it was very well received.

63
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,743
<i>Warden Gentles had convinced
his granddaughter's teacher...</i>

64
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,581
<i>to mount</i> New Warden
<i>as a school play.</i>

65
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,623
- I understand you've been causing problems.
- Nobody sells any coke...

66
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,215
in this pen
without daddy getting a taste.

67
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,387
Beat him with a pillowcase
full of batteries.

68
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,432
Ward's letting us hold the event
in the new wing of the prison.

69
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,470
After lockdown, everyone's going
to spend the night in a cell.

70
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,407
Are they color or black and white?

71
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:08,446
So, Michael, I don't need your help at all...
unless you need something from me?

72
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:13,451
No. I'm fine. Just thought I could help.
Relieved I don't have to.

73
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,580
<i>But he wasn't relieved.
So he went home to complain to his sister, Lindsay.</i>

74
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,557
Prison's the last thing we want people
associating with the Bluth name.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,094
- Plus, who's gonna want to go?
- Wait, this is gonna be at the prison?

76
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,687
Oh, great.
Probably gonna run into that warden.

77
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,289
- How do you know the warden?
- Oh, right.

78
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,926
Uh, he spoke at my school
for a "Startled Straight" assembly.

79
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,471
<i>Actually, she'd met with him in the hopes...</i>

80
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,770
<i>of using his prison
as a location for a film.</i>

81
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:42,337
I think you will find the desert
both engrossing... and high grossing.

82
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,507
So we don't get dessert.

83
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,585
I guess I have some reading to do.

84
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,952
Besides I doubt very much Mom's come up
with a real disease to have a fund-raiser for.

85
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,355
I forgot. We have a real disease.
I chose it:

86
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,656
GVH, "Graft Versus Host."

87
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,493
It's new, it's fatal,
and guess who's got it?

88
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,067
You've heard of bodies
rejecting transplants.

89
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,626
Well, in this case, your transplanted hair
is rejecting your body.

90
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,638
Either you remove your hair graft...

91
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,504
or the host, you, will get
sicker and eventually die.

92
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,013
- Can you think of any benefits?
- Benefits? No. He'll die.

93
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,675
Oh, oh, yeah. No, I... I get that.
But have there ever been any fund-raisers?

94
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:23,381
A husband with the headlining disease.
Everyone's gonna wanna talk to me.

95
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,186
- You're making him keep the hair?
- Did you see the attention Superman's wife got?

96
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,591
- Besides, Tobias wants it too.
- Oh, she's right.

97
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,290
Th-This is gonna be great for me,
because I am gonna star...

98
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,491
in the video Gob's making for the gala.

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,228
Oh, yeah.
It'll be very uplifting.

100
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,669
- Oh, here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

101
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,672
Oh. Oh, this is gonna hurt. Oh!

102
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,177
You know what? We're gonna
need this from another angle.

103
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,612
- And you're sure you're okay?
- Oh, probably.

104
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,150
I can't feel anything.
How's my hair?

105
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,084
It's fine.
It's sucking the life out of you, Tobias.

106
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,316
I mean, everything's gone crazy...
the gala, Mom and Warden Gentles.

107
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,892
I mean, what is in it for him?
I think he's taking advantage of Mom.

108
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,894
And did it ever occur to you
that maybe Warden Gentles likes her?

109
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:08,865
- Likes her what?
- No, I... I mean, likes her, like, is attracted to her.

110
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,768
- Who's the "her" in that sentence?
- Mom. Warden Gentles likes Mom.

111
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,898
- Her?
- I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this.

112
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,273
The guy runs a prison.
He can have any piece of ass he wants.

113
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,813
And if he likes her in that sense,
it makes it even worse.

114
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,974
I don't want Mom mixed up with the sort of creep
that would have her as a fetish.

115
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,814
Oh, Michael, you're just feeling
neglected by your mother.

116
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,820
You wanted to go to this with her,
didn't you?

117
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,254
Hey, I... I don't need
to take my mom to a gala, okay?

118
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,383
Only losers go to those things
with their parents.

119
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,792
- I'm going with my son.
- Oh, I may skip that. I don't like galas.

120
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,330
<i>Actually, he loved galas.</i>

121
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,334
<i>- All kids do.</i> - Oh, come on.
Don't leave your Uncle Tea Bag hangin'.

122
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,996
- Please don't call yourself that.
<i>- What he was having trouble with...</i>

123
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,801
<i>was looking directly at his dying uncle.</i>

124
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,400
I can't stand by and watch Mom get hurt.
I gotta get down there.

125
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,346
This is heartbreaking.
Gotta get this for the video.

126
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,418
George Michael, you wanna put your head
down there by his drainage shunt?

127
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,717
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was also feeling abandoned by Mother.</i>

128
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,919
Mo... Mother! I have no one now.

129
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:12,088
<i>But at that very moment,
his true father returned.</i>

130
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,190
Uncle-father Oscar,
what are you doing here?

131
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:20,204
Well, you know me. I could
never leave a little bud behind.

132
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:25,334
Oh, a hug. Nice. You haven't seen
a little box with a turtle on it, have you?

133
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,279
Oh, yeah. My turtle was living in it
before he ate all the grass and died.

134
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,282
- He ate all the grass?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,443
- It's been great catching up.
- W-W-Wait, where you going?

136
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,613
No, I can't stay,
because if my brother finds out that I'm here...

137
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,818
he's gonna try switching places again,
and I can't go back to prison.

138
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,657
- If my father comes in, you can hide
in one of Gob's tricks. - I can't.

139
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:48,632
- At least you can stay and help me bury
my poor turtle. - Or we could cremate it.

140
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:53,137
<i>And Maeby was having a harder time finishing
Warden Gentle's screenplay than he did.</i>

141
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,471
How'd you like to read something fun that
we could talk about on the way to the prison gala?

142
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,809
Oh, I'm actually gonna sit that out.
I'm just burnt out on prisons lately.

143
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,075
- Well, this might change your mind.
- Is that a screenplay?

144
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,310
Well, that's what you're gonna tell me.

145
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,320
<i>And Michael raced to warn his mother
of the warden's intentions.</i>

146
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,322
- Hey! You can't park there.
- Oh, sorry.

147
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,915
- I'm sorry.
- No stairs. No parking.

148
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:17,826
Sorry.

149
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,065
Everything looks delicious.

150
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,533
Oh, One-Eye's a wonderful chef.

151
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:28,096
I've had to go to his parole hearings twice
and lie through my teeth to keep him here.

152
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,665
Hi, I just, um...

153
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,245
Wow.
What are you guys doing?

154
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,784
It's perfectly innocent, but I can see
how if our roles were reversed...

155
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,446
I might have you beaten
with a pillowcase full of batteries.

156
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,455
- I'll give you two a moment.
- Thank you.

157
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,617
I don't know why I always assume
that everyone's read my screenplay.

158
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,163
What is wrong with you?
That man is being wonderful to us.

159
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,700
And that doesn't concern you, Mother?
For all you know he could be trying to seduce you.

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
- Oh, Michael, you're crazy.
- I certainly hope so.

161
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,602
I'm trying to seduce him.

162
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,970
- Who's the "I" in that sentence?
- Me.

163
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,044
- You?
<i>- Her.</i>

164
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,577
<i>Michael had just discovered that
his mother was interested in another man.</i>

165
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,783
- Mom wants to sleep with the warden.
- What? Oh, God!

166
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,054
- Great. - Great? The man is old enough
to be her contemporary, Lindsay.

167
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,562
Plus, she's married, okay? She can't be
writhing around underneath the covers...

168
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,066
- What is wrong with you? It's disgusting! God!
- Take it easy.

169
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,966
No, it's just I've always had a thing
about Mom and Dad being together.

170
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,596
- I know that.
- I have a sense of propriety, my God.

171
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,766
- Gob, we've had this conversation.
- When?

172
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,243
- The last time you ended up seeing Mom
and Dad go at it. - What? No! God, Michael!

173
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,782
- I did no such thing.
<i>- He did very much that thing...</i>

174
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,478
<i>when his parents got intimate
in a conjugal trailer two years ago.</i>

175
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,612
<i>But thankfully,
he'd found a way to forget that.</i>

176
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:54,352
I got a thing of pills in my pocket. I don't suppose
I could convince you to grab me one.

177
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,623
<i>- Luckily, that worked too.</i>
- I can't even hear this.

178
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,755
You may not like it
that Mom has needs...

179
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,026
but it never bothered you
when Dad was running around.

180
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,537
- Well, that was different. - Well, how 'bout
when she was sleeping with Uncle Oscar?

181
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,538
The guy looks just like Dad.

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,666
I don't know. He's family.
It seemed very natural they'd be together.

183
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,643
Who? What? What is natural?
Is there new legislation on this now?

184
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,682
<i>George Michael was concerned about
family love after reading Maeby's script...</i>

185
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,516
<i>- which he took as a subtle message to him
from his cousin.</i> - Listen, new fish.

186
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,590
That bunk was open
because the last guy...

187
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,988
wouldn't do the things
that you're going to do.

188
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:32,121
- We're going to... do things? - Anything
can happen when two people share a cell, coz.

189
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,200
Um, I'll go...
Okay, I'll go with you to the prison.

190
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:40,136
George Michael, what I want you to do is run
upstairs and run a nice bath for Uncle Tobias.

191
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,868
And I want you to help him get in the tub.
Can you do that for me? Thanks.

192
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,672
And don't make the water too hot.
The scabs come right off.

193
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,577
<i>Come on, Lindsay. What are we gonna do about Mother?
- Honestly, Michael...

194
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,618
all this "Mother" talk...
you're starting to sound a lot like Buster.

195
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,983
<i>And Michael realized there was somebody else...</i>

196
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,988
<i>in the family who would care about this.</i>

197
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,491
Buster's gonna take this so hard.
I cannot let my brother get hurt.

198
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,494
Oh!

199
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,573
Oh, it's on standby. Got another one in you?

200
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,336
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was enjoying being with Oscar.</i>

201
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,934
<i>But Oscar was longing
for his sweet freedom.</i>

202
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:25,348
Say, you don't have any Sweet Freedom or Tropical
Ease or any of the Hawaiian blends, do you?

203
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,749
Someone's coming.

204
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,584
Oh, Dad, get in the cage
and hide behind the mirror. It'll look empty.

205
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,821
<i>Oscar never got a chance
to hide behind the mirror.</i>

206
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,226
<i>Although it was not the first time...</i>

207
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,730
<i>he was knocked out
by a powerful lid.</i>

208
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,202
Hey, Buster, listen.
I got some bad news about Mom.

209
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,137
She's planning on spending the night
with another man.

210
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,708
- Gob?
- N-No. Not another brother.

211
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,938
- Oh. Then why do we care?
- What is wrong with everyone?

212
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,243
Uh, B-Buster, you've got to talk to Mom
about this. She can't possibly do it.

213
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,477
- If Dad finds out, he'll go berserk.
- If Dad finds out about what?

214
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,022
Oh. Well, I guess I've got no choice now.
Dad, I-I've got some bad news...

215
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:08,787
about Mom and Warden Gentles...
dating.

216
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,692
Oh. Better sit down.

217
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,096
Okay, what's the news?

218
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,728
- They're dating.
- Oh, yeah. Because she's... she's my wife.

219
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,432
- Oh, yeah. Damn it!
- I'm surprised you're not more upset about this.

220
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,940
When you first told me,
but you see, time... time passes.

221
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,240
Besides, it's only, uh, dinner in the office.
I mean it's not Le Cirque.

222
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,440
- How'd you know that it was in his office?
- Well, wh-where...

223
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,575
where the hell else are they gonna go
at 4:00 in the afternoon?

224
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,517
It was around 4:00.
You already know about this.

225
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,088
- Come on.
- You're up to something, right?

226
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,453
- No.
- You both are. She's workin' the warden.

227
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,823
- You're makin' fake heads. You're planning
an escape. - How dare you?

228
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,988
I oughta shave your head and make you
sit under that camera all night, mister.

229
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,091
It's unbelievable. You know, I was worried that
this guy was gonna take advantage of Mom.

230
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:55,105
You both were taking advantage of him. I don't
know why I work to keep this family together.

231
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,004
Michael, can I talk to you
for one sec?

232
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:02,206
<i>- And that's when George Sr. got a call from Lucille.</i>
- Three, two, two, five, two.

233
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,510
Howdy doody, that's it.

234
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,246
Now, y-you get back here
so you can smuggle me out...

235
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,322
past the guards
before Michael starts blabbing.

236
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,720
You know what?
You can smuggle yourself out.

237
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,020
You wanna get away from me so bad?
You're free.

238
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,391
But I'm free too, baby.

239
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,023
I'm staying in the conjugal trailer
with the warden tonight.

240
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,802
Him?

241
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:29,238
- Hey, why is there an ambulance out front?
- Honey, the car is here.

242
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,139
Hey, do you need a ride?
I mean, you'll have to lie down, but...

243
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:36,112
I'm not goin'. The whole thing is a scam.
Mom was using that warden to try to get Dad out.

244
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,945
- She's not trying to seduce him at all.
- Oh, no. She is.

245
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,884
She's spending the night with him.
She just called to ask me to bring her...

246
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,048
a tube of "Vagis-table" paste.
Hi, George Michael.

247
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,423
- You're goin' too, huh?
- Yeah. I thought I would, um, just go with Maeby...

248
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,361
and support her through this whole
Graft Versus Host thing.

249
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,399
<i>And Michael himself was feeling a little like...</i>

250
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,095
<i>the host that the grafting family
was rejecting.</i>

251
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:03,540
Good. Great. Go. It's a very important cause.
So I'll just stay here and read.

252
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,772
<i>But this, too, would prove challenging
as the family had no books.</i>

253
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,014
<i>Other than those.
And that's when Michael got a glimpse...</i>

254
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,385
<i>into the warden's true intentions
with his mother.</i>

255
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,927
You were just using me to get even
with the man who broke out of your prison?

256
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,087
That escape cost me my promotion.

257
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,133
And you will pay for
the loss of $2,300 a year.

258
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,136
But you gave me presents.
We made love.

259
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:38,143
I've given you one last present.
Enjoy the chlamydia, Lucille. Ha, ha, ha.

260
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,771
Take this newly diseased
woman to the hole. Ha.

261
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,645
I wish I'd read
<i>The Man Inside Me.</i>

262
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,745
<i>George Sr. needed to escape...</i>

263
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,758
<i>but his handmade replica
would never fool the cameras.</i>

264
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,456
<i>So he searched through Gob's magic stuff
to find something that might.</i>

265
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,899
- Well, that was a freebie. - Hey, Gob, I'm glad
you're here. I thought you'd be at the gala.

266
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,403
Yeah, Dad made me move my stuff
outta Buster's room.

267
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,235
<i>But only after hiding himself in the cage...</i>

268
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,775
<i>to get past the cops at the door.</i>

269
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,074
- Go. - Mom's being set up.
We have to get into that prison.

270
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,149
- It's after lockdown. - Come on, Gob.
You were gonna break out of this place once.

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,617
- I know you can help me break in.
- It's not a Jamba Juice, Michael.

272
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,915
It shouldn't be that hard to break into.

273
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:29,017
<i>And Buster returned only to find
no evidence of his uncle-father.</i>

274
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,255
Hey, Father-uncle Dad...

275
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,263
I was just bringin' some juice for my pet.

276
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,766
Wait a minute.
You're not really smiling.

277
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,303
I'm Oscar. He did it again.

278
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:44,206
I told you he would.
I can't go through this again. I can't be caged!

279
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,577
<i>And Buster realized
he needed to give his true father his freedom.</i>

280
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,516
- Hey! Let's get him!
<i>- But it was a freedom that didn't last long.</i>

281
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,179
<i>And as the prison gala was underway...</i>

282
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,381
<i>the guys arrived for their break-in...</i>

283
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,857
<i>with the help of one of George Sr.'s
instruments of escape.</i>

284
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,897
- You think this is gonna work?
- It's a jet pack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong?

285
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,525
- All right. - Now just make sure you tell me
before you hit any buttons...

286
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,729
- Good. Now we know what the strap is for.
- Okay.

287
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,741
- Under the crotch. Yup.
- We need a new plan.

288
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:22,246
- Wish I knew the layout of this place.
- Way ahead of you, Michael.

289
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:26,011
Drew a map of it on my stomach.
It's upside down, so it might be a little awkward.

290
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,245
<i>- It was awkward.</i>
- I drew us.

291
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,050
- I think we're, like, right there.
- Hey, guys.

292
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,388
- If you're gonna party, you wanna bring it inside?
- That was a freebie.

293
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,587
Well, the new facility isn't so bad, huh?

294
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,596
It's a lot like school,
only it's air-conditioned.

295
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,464
So I guess we can just, uh... just choose a cell
to stay overnight in and, uh...

296
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,300
Oh, great. And you can take me through
your thoughts about the screenplay beat by beat.

297
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:52,002
Sure. Yeah. "Because anything can happen
when two people share a cell, coz."

298
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,376
It's a line from...
from <i>New Warden.</i>

299
00:16:55,481 --> 00:17:00,180
Oh. Oh! Okay, yeah.
I don't know what I was worried about.

300
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,083
<i>That would be the happiest moment...</i>

301
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,748
<i>George Michael
would ever experience in his life.</i>

302
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,753
<i>- And the warden was happy too.</i>
- What a treat.

303
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:15,027
The man who cost me my promotion
ends up back in my care.

304
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:20,128
And I don't think there's going to be
an "I'm Oscar" Web site this time.

305
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,697
Think this time I'll do a podcast.

306
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,142
"Graft Versus Host."
Sounds like a tennis match...

307
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,215
between Steffi Graf
and <i>Happy Days</i> star Donny "Host."

308
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,545
<i>- It's "Most."</i>
- But it's far deadlier.

309
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,710
Hello. I'm Gob Bluth.

310
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,384
As a magician,
I can make a lot of things disappear.

311
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,221
There are some things
I can't make disappear...

312
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,728
no, not that candy ball machine...

313
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,561
the disease GVH without your help.

314
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,761
This is Tobias.
When Toby first came into the family...

315
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,100
none of us much wanted him around...

316
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,766
but that's because we couldn't see
what was on the inside.

317
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,606
But lately, that's all we've been able to see.

318
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,710
But what was Tobias to do...

319
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,743
Have his hair plugs removed?

320
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,252
The doctor says I'd be completely healed
if I were to do that.

321
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,120
- He just needs his hair plugs out?
- Doctor says that's the cure.

322
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:17,457
- There's a cure? - No way. That horsehair
is my ticket back into society.

323
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,589
You cut it after those idiots at the gala
accept me as one of their own.

324
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,361
We're giving money for this guy
to keep his hair transplants?

325
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,629
I'd rather give to TBA!

326
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,504
<i>The crowd began to grow unruly.</i>

327
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,269
We have a riot in the ballroom.

328
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,970
<i>And, just as the prisoners had proven...</i>

329
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,513
<i>they could throw a gala
as well as the rich...</i>

330
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,551
<i>so the rich proved they could throw a riot
just as well as the prisoners.</i>

331
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,281
<i>- And Lucille was brought to the conjugal trailer.</i>
- Mom.

332
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,823
- Michael, what are you doing?
- I cannot let you go through with this.

333
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,485
- You can't sleep with him.
- Oh, yes I can.

334
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,962
I'm making up for the heartbreak
your father has caused me. He doesn't need me.

335
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,796
- You don't need me.
- Of course I need you, Mom.

336
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,360
My heart is kind of broken too.
I've been kind of denying it lately, but...

337
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,838
um, you know, it just... I can't...
I can't deal with the fact...

338
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,375
that my family's falling apart,
now that I really need you.

339
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:10,380
Oh, Michael, honey.
I wanna cry so bad...

340
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,813
but I don't think
I can spare the moisture.

341
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,718
Well, listen. Here's...

342
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,758
The problem is that, uh,
Gentles doesn't really care for you.

343
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,386
He's just using you to get back at Dad for escaping,
at least according to his screenplay.

344
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,157
- You read it?
- Yeah.

345
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:30,065
- Did you like the chlamydia thing? I gave him that.
- You gave <i>him</i> chlamydia?

346
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,833
- He had "crabs," and I said, "You're gonna get laughs."
- Then what am I doing?

347
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,138
I mean, if Dad doesn't care, there's...
there's no real threat...

348
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,678
and, I guess,
just knock yourself out, huh?

349
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,010
Where's Gentles? I'll kill him!

350
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,175
- George? - Dad?
- I can't let you do this.

351
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:52,019
I can't let what we have...
as lousy as it may be at times... be destroyed.

352
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,355
This is where you escaped to?
To prison? For me?

353
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,395
No one is breaking this family apart.
No one.

354
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,624
You know what?
I think I needed to hear that.

355
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:05,435
Sorry about the wait.
George? If you're here...

356
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,404
who do we have
in the delousing tank?

357
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,339
- I'm guessing Oscar.
- No.

358
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,706
I cannot take another $2,300 hit.

359
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,804
I'll tell you what: You let Oscar out,
and you give us an hour in here...

360
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,612
and, uh, we'll call it even.

361
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,146
Please, Ward?

362
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:29,888
I can't say no to the woman
who gave me "chlamydia." One hour.

363
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,628
Are you ready to have some fun?

364
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:39,261
- I am <i>so</i> glad I didn't cry.
- That I didn't need to hear.

365
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,974
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

366
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,201
<i>George Michael gets closer to his family.</i>

367
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:51,308
<i>- Lockdown!</i>
- That was close, huh, Maeby?

368
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,943
Oh, she's in the next cell. Looks like
we're gonna be bunk buddies all night, coz.

369
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,749
<i>George Michael experiences...</i>

370
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,949
<i>his unhappiest moment ever.</i>

371
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,727
<i>Buster tries to forget
his recent losses...</i>

372
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,357
<i>by breaking out the old guitar...</i>

373
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,870
<i>- and Gob finally faces a phobia he'd faced before.</i>
- No! Not here!

374
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,670
Wait, I've seen this before.
Oh, God, I've seen this before!

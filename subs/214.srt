1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,742
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,282
<i>Michael was surprised to find the house...</i>

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,856
<i>still a mess a week</i>
<i>after the fumigation.</i>

7
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:28,690
You still haven't put this stuff back yet?
You've got to be the laziest person in the world.

8
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,889
If you weren't all the way on the other side
of the room, I'd slap your face.

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,434
- I asked you to clean this up.
- Yeah, and you also asked me
to call the fumigators...

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,696
and you haven't even thanked me
for doing that.

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,967
<i>Michael</i> had <i>asked her</i>
<i>to do this, but that was long before...</i>

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,634
<i>he began hiding his fugitive father</i>
<i>in the attic.</i>

13
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,611
What? Uh- Oh, God.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,706
Polly, cover your mouth!

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,719
<i>Luckily, Michael was notified in time.</i>

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,120
<i>Well, we had a deal, you know. I'd pay</i>
<i>for everything, and you'd clean the house.</i>

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,057
- And you've only done it once.
- <i>She hadn't even done it that time...</i>

18
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,289
<i>but instead, intercepted</i>
<i>her mother's housekeeper...</i>

19
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,763
- <i>as she was arriving for work.</i>
- <i>Can I take you the rest of the way?</i>

20
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:11,394
- <i>Mrs.</i>- <i>Mrs.</i>-
- Oh, I have to make one quick stop first.

21
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,998
<i>Almost done. Yours or mister's?</i>

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,134
Mister's.

23
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,077
<i>Lupe never accepted a ride from Lindsay again.</i>

24
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,140
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Michael,</i>
<i>but Tobias moving out hasn't been easy.</i>

25
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,276
For any of us.

26
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,617
You didn't even notice he'd gone,
did you?

27
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,917
I did notice we'd stopped TiVoing
<i>The Christopher Lowell Show.</i>

28
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,654
- What happened?
- <i>I tried to give it one last chance.</i>

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,822
- Like what you see?
- <i>I've been looking for those.</i>

30
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,594
- You're gonna stretch them out.
- That's all you can say?

31
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,932
Well, excuse me for liking the way
they shape my junk.

32
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,438
I don't know why, but that's it.

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,340
You can pack your junk
and get out.

34
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,004
You're kicking me out?
At the beginning of pilot season?

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,483
You're not gonna make it as an actor,
and we're not gonna make it as a couple.

36
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,611
<i>With nowhere to go,</i>
<i>Tobias went to the studio...</i>

37
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,054
<i>where he'd occasionally worked</i>
<i>as a security guard and took up residence...</i>

38
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,117
<i>in the apartment of Detective Frank Wrench,</i>
<i>on the set of the television show...</i>

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,356
Wrench.

40
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,490
<i>I'm really sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>How's Maeby taking it?</i>

41
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,196
- Well, she's really hard to read.
- You haven't told her yet.

42
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,864
Well, she was so excited the hot water
in the shower was lasting longer.

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,807
How could I have the heart to tell her
it's because her father moved out?

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,141
Tobias moved out?

45
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,978
- Did he take the good video camera with him?
- <i>That's touching.</i>

46
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,178
- What do you need the camera for?
- I'm making a magic video.

47
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,915
I'm gonna tape myself
doing tricks around the office.

48
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:41,255
I'm calling it <i>Tricks</i>-
Let me finish- <i>around the Office.</i>

49
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,852
I figured out a way to
make money while I'm working.

50
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,228
That <i>is</i> what we call working. Something
you might wanna try next time you're at the office.

51
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,030
<i>You've been missing things lately.</i>
<i>I'm gettin'real tired of it.</i>

52
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,731
<i>Incidentally, today we're having a big vote</i>
<i>on that building renovation.</i>

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,673
- I need you there to help me vote it in.
- Fine. I'll vote...

54
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,676
as long as
you give me the camera.

55
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,611
I think we all know
that George Michael was using it last.

56
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:05,810
<i>A fact the family had discovered</i>
<i>when they'd gathered to watch a home video.</i>

57
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,252
Was that a 40th anniversary party, huh?
Didn't cost us a thing.

58
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,290
Is that Qusay Hussein
at the omelet bar?

59
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,452
Look at this. If these guys move,
they don't get paid.

60
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,098
<i>It seems that as a 13-year-old,</i>
<i>George Michael had been...</i>

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,862
<i>heavily influenced</i>
<i>by the</i> Star Wars <i>films...</i>

62
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,461
<i>and had endeavored to</i>
<i>re-create his favorite moments.</i>

63
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,736
- You're not my father! You'll never be!
- I spent $2.1 million...

64
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,310
<i>of good company money</i>
<i>and end up with this?</i>

65
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,710
<i>You cut off my hand!</i>
<i>Worth every penny.</i>

66
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,306
Even you have to admit that
that was the lamest thing ever put on tape.

67
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,683
<i>Not so. Buster</i>
<i>had once videotaped himself...</i>

68
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,656
<i>re-creating moments from his</i>
<i>then favorite film,</i> Chicago.

69
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:50,388
<i>He also liked</i> Star Wars.

70
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,301
His self-esteem is low enough as it is,
and I have no idea why.

71
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,564
<i>I mean, he's such a great kid, and</i>
<i>everybody loves him. He's George Michael!</i>

72
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:03,768
<i>Truthfully, that's why I'm not that crazy</i>
<i>about that Ann, but he'll move on.</i>

73
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,812
Unless he knocks her up like you did
with his mother. Plus, she's religious.

74
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,906
If that one gets pregnant,
it stays pregnant.

75
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,851
Believe me. I dated a chick like that
once in high school.

76
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,081
No, I didn't.

77
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,956
<i>I gotta work</i>
<i>on that boy's self-esteem.</i>

78
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,325
<i>Michael went to do so,</i>
<i>only to hear Ann beating him to it.</i>

79
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,489
- <i>I want you to do it.</i>
- <i>I don't think I'm ready.</i>

80
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,863
- <i>Of course you are.</i>
- <i>I'm gonna lose it before I start.</i>

81
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,300
Don't start!

82
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,773
Smoking. It's a killer. That Sammy Davis Jr.
Should still be performing.

83
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,867
- What's going on?
- Ann thinks I should run
for student body president.

84
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,446
- That's a great idea.
- Well, I don't have a chance.

85
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,482
- They only vote for the cool kids.
- But everyone loves you.

86
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,848
You are George Michael!
Who's cooler than you?

87
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,485
Plus, you would be following
in your old man's footsteps.

88
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,684
- You were student body president?
- Oh-ho.

89
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,125
- It was close.
- So you lost.

90
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,992
- Who remembers?
- I know I would remember.

91
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,156
Ann, if my dad says
that he won, then he won.

92
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,700
<i>Didn't say I won.</i>
<i>Said I can't remember.</i>

93
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:07,136
But now that we're thinking about it, I seem
to remember the other guy won the title...

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,209
although there were plenty in the school
who wanted to overturn the decision.

95
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,838
I said, "Let's- Do not- Let's not
put the school through that."

96
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,415
Haven't thought about that for years.
Good memory.

97
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,476
<i>Well, anyway, I'll help you run your campaign</i>
<i>and make your commercial for election day.</i>

98
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,112
Well, that's great.
The important thing is...

99
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:29,923
to raise the old self-esteem and not
to rush a physical relationship.

100
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,362
- Those are really the two important things.
- <i>No. We're both waiting.</i>

101
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,835
- Good.
- And then that first time,
after waiting and waiting-

102
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,202
It's gonna be so awesome, because it's not
just gonna be my love and George Michael's...

103
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,275
but God's love as well.

104
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,005
- God, it's gonna be incredible.
- <i>All right. I'll do it. I'm in.</i>

105
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,343
- Campaign?
- I'm pumped.

106
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,543
<i>As George Michael was</i>
<i>on the path to higher self-esteem...</i>

107
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,485
<i>Buster was losing</i>
<i>what little he had.</i>

108
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,522
I can't put the aorta in
with this thing.

109
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,490
<i>Oh, stop complaining.</i>

110
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,859
- Buster!
- I'm sorry I'm an inconvenience to you, Mother.

111
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:09,594
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh!

112
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,865
<i>As Lupe felt sorry...</i>

113
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:17,875
<i>for Buster's loss of a hand,</i>
<i>Lindsay felt sorry for her loss of Lupe.</i>

114
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,954
<i>Lindsay had cleaned one room</i>
<i>and now had a garbage problem.</i>

115
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,462
<i>And while looking for a spot to stash the refuse...</i>

116
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,464
<i>She came upon an old friend.</i>

117
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,161
I haven't seen this in ages. EBay.

118
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,171
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was a new friend to George Sr.</i>

119
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,299
Polly!

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,040
<i>Back at the office, Michael came</i>
<i>to regret having given Gob the video camera.</i>

121
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,309
Well, I certainly
appreciate your decision...

122
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,079
but if my brother was here,
we could've voted this thing through.

123
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,384
What's this?
A stuffy office meeting?

124
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,984
Well, maybe it's time
for a little... <i>Office Magic.</i>

125
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:14,431
- What's "office magic"?
<i>- Sometimes it's as simple as turning 10:45...</i>

126
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,470
in the morning into lunchtime!

127
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,836
- Okay.
- Why does lunch have to be so dull?

128
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,139
Maybe you'd
prefer some chicken instead!

129
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,806
All right. Let's cut.
Take five, everybody.

130
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,147
- No, no. We're not takin' five.
Hey, is this guy with you?
- Yeah, he's an actor.

131
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,278
Well, you know, I thought
he was an investor. He voted against me...

132
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,949
which is the vote I asked you
to be here for, so-

133
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,858
You know what? I don't know why, but that's it.
I don't think I can work with you anymore.

134
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,453
- You kind of have to, guy. I'm the president.
- No. I'm the president.

135
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,399
No. You lost the presidency, just like you did
in high school when you refused to play dirty.

136
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,970
- Worked when I ran.
- We're talkin' about the office here, okay?

137
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,062
I do all the work. I've been helping you.
That's over now.

138
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:58,007
Sorry to hear you say that, Michael,
'cause it just cost you your job.

139
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,874
- I'm serious. It's over.
- How do you call Security on this thing?

140
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,040
- You hit pound-zero-zero to operate the system.
- Pound is tic-tac-toe, right?

141
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,846
- Yeah. Pound is right-
- When I keep hitting that, the other thing flashes.

142
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,387
- Hit pound and then zero-zero.
- I do. I know.

143
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,390
Tell you what. You don't need to learn
the system, because you're out of here.

144
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,983
You're fired.

145
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,994
Have Security send a man up.

146
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,496
You've got the wrong guy.

147
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,591
<i>Uh, no, you don't,</i>
<i>but you don't have to do this.</i>

148
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,433
<i>But the guard had recently</i>
<i>lost halfhis tie to</i> Office Magic.

149
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,406
- Oh, I don't mind.
- Get this. You getting this?

150
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,410
Cheat out.
You have to cheat out a little bit.

151
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,174
- Oh, hey.
- What was that all about?

152
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,114
Your uncle doesn't
not-work here anymore.

153
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:42,517
- So I guess your mom told you
about your dad moving out, huh?
- No, she did not tell me that.

154
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,852
- Oh.
- But she doesn't tell me anything.

155
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,017
- Neither of them do.
- Sorry. Guess I shouldn't have said anything.

156
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,290
Maybe I should just start
keeping some secrets of my own.

157
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,456
Why aren't you at school right now?

158
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,057
Marry me.

159
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,069
I'm so sorry.
I forgot who I was talking to.

160
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,766
I was just using your copier
to make some campaign posters.

161
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,639
Well, then, by all means,
let me help you out.

162
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,543
I mean, I don't even know why I'm doing it.
He's gonna win by a landslide.

163
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,139
- That's what I was tellin' him.
- How do you know Steve Holt?

164
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,650
- Are you in A.A.?
- I was talkin' about George Michael.

165
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,983
He's running for student body president.
Who's Steve Holt?

166
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,057
He's just the hottest guy in school.
And he's won three years in a row-

167
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,058
every year after his first junior year.

168
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,390
So, then, he's more popular
than George Michael?

169
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:27,899
Well, that's like comparing apples
and some fruit nobody's ever heard of.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,491
He might even finish
after the Indian kid.

171
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,039
I guess I gotta get down to the school
and see if I can stop him from signing up, huh?

172
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,008
Yes. You have to. And do you think you could
put up a couple of these when you're there...

173
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,170
'cause I was really not
in the mood to go down there.

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,080
<i>Michael went to take care ofhis son...</i>

175
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,915
<i>as Lucille discovered that hers</i>
<i>was already being taken care of.</i>

176
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,049
Mother!
- And yet you're too good
to polish the candlesticks?

177
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,754
- You're fired!
- You can't fire me. I'm your son.

178
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,660
- I'm firing you!
- I was firing Lupe!

179
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,494
Well, that makes more sense.

180
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,867
- <i>Lindsay came upon Lupe, who'djust been fired.</i>
- I no clean for family anymore.

181
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,705
Can't you at least
come over and DustBuster or something?

182
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,338
- I no does Buster anymore.
- Fine.

183
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,441
I'll DustBuster! God.

184
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,782
- Hello?
- Hey. I can't talk loudly.

185
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,788
I'm in the bathroom of the <i>Wrench</i> set,
and they've started shooting.

186
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,020
Also, I don't think this is a real toilet.

187
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,996
So I just wanted to check on Maeby
and tell you that I haven't landed a part yet...

188
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,830
but despite what you may think,
my talent shall win out.

189
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,736
Well, Maeby's fine. We've been looking
for a cleaning lady, so if you hear of one-

190
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,570
Shh- Shh.
- <i>... dirty cop,</i>
<i>so Frank Wrench is gonna clean ya.</i>

191
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,611
<i>- Why is this door locked?</i>
<i>- Cut!</i>

192
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,806
- <i>Is somebody using the set bathroom?</i>
- I gotta go.

193
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,715
<i>Michael arrived at school</i>
<i>to talk his son out of running for office.</i>

194
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,845
It took me all day, but I got the 10 signatures.
I'm running for student body president.

195
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:02,519
- Listen, George Michael-
- <i>We're gonna use your idea</i>
<i>and highlight being chaste.</i>

196
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,927
I just meant you two shouldn't-
You're not gonna put up this poster, are you?

197
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,626
It's really gonna appeal
to the Christian crowd.

198
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,431
I couldn't have done this without you guys.
I'm gonna win this thing.

199
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,998
Four more years! Four more years!

200
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,577
Four more years!
Four more years!

201
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,580
<i>And Gob showed up at his mother's.</i>

202
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,845
- Well, guess who's been fired.
- Michael fired you?

203
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,682
No. I fired him. As a result,
I'm no longer welcome in the office.

204
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,758
What a coincidence.
I just fired my housekeeper...

205
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,258
but I've already found a replacement.

206
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,125
It's a robot.

207
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,599
- I hate it. I miss Lupe.
- No. I won't let you go down that road.

208
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,796
I want you to be strong, and you don't
need the comfort of an immigrant...

209
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,567
in Mother's old stirrup pants
to make you feel that way.

210
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,542
Oh.

211
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,136
Ohh, you're hungry.

212
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,910
<i>Lindsay was about</i>
<i>to find a replacement for Lupe as well.</i>
- Who is it?

213
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,146
The new housekeeper. The agency sent me over.

214
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,313
I'm sorry. I didn't call any-

215
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:09,656
Oh, allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Phyllidia Featherbottom...

216
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:14,665
and I can cook and I can clean
and I can take care of the little ones.

217
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:19,568
I can also sing a song or two,
if it comes in handy.

218
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,041
When you put a squirt
of frosting on your throat

219
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,111
Before we take
our medications

220
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,808
<i>Tobias had gained access to</i>
<i>the studio's wardrobe and makeup department.</i>

221
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,214
<i>He was eager</i>
<i>to both see his daughter...</i>

222
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,255
<i>and prove to his wife</i>
<i>that he had what it took to be an actor.</i>

223
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:42,157
- <i>It was the exact plot of the film</i> Mrs. Doubtfire.
- In the most delicious way

224
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,425
<i>There was also</i>
<i>some Mary Poppins in there.</i>
- Let's get this house cleaned.

225
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,695
Hey. Lindsay,
the place looks fantastic.

226
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,796
- What? Did you pay somebody to do this?
- Oh, I've no need for payment.

227
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,535
The love of the family
is more than enough.

228
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,669
I'm sorry.
This is Mrs. Featherbottom.

229
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,613
From Blackstone.
I'm charmed, I'm sure.

230
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,015
Ooh!

231
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,485
Back to work.

232
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,216
- I think he misses his daughter.
- That's convenient...

233
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,555
considering you didn't even have the courage
to tell Maeby that he'd moved out.

234
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,129
I'm sorry.
I'm not the perfect parent, like you.

235
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,393
I'm not that perfect. I pushed George Michael
into running for office...

236
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,401
and I think he's gonna
get crushed by this kid Steve Holt.

237
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,904
<i>Yeah. I'd vote for Steve.</i>
<i>Too bad Dad's on the lam.</i>

238
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:32,706
You could finally use some of his dirty tricks
to get George Michael elected.

239
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,212
<i>As it happens,</i>
George Sr. Had come to...

240
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,011
<i>in the attic, and perhaps it was the effect</i>
<i>oflosing his one friend</i>-

241
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,144
- Polly?
- <i>or the lingering effects of the fumigation</i>-

242
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,087
<i>or perhaps it really was</i>
<i>divine intervention</i>-

243
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,991
<i>but he'd had a profound realization.</i>

244
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,725
<i>Unfortunately, the timing</i>
<i>of the enlightenment wasn't ideal for Michael.</i>

245
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,896
- That's why I need your help.
- "Our Heavenly Father let his son die...

246
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,405
so that our sins
could be absolved."

247
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,569
- Great. So you're a Christian now.
- "We must all seek forgiveness."

248
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,170
Well, I'll call the warden for you.
You can ask him yourself.

249
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:14,742
Well, I think that's for fresh crimes.
Besides, you've always tried to lead a clean life.

250
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:20,190
You and Gob were like
those biblical brothers, Gallant and, um-

251
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,283
"Goofuth."

252
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,625
<i>Michael realized he</i> had <i>lived like Gallant...</i>

253
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,291
<i>and ifhe wanted</i>
<i>to help his son's election...</i>

254
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,527
<i>he would have to find...</i>
<i>Goofuth.</i>

255
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,230
- Been lookin' all over for you, pal.
- If you came to grovel...

256
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,307
for the job of president,
you're too late.

257
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:40,401
- My brother already fired me.
- Listen, I'm really sorry that I got upset with you...

258
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,916
you know, and I never meant to, um-
I didn't even mean to fire you.

259
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,941
You know, and I never meant to, um-
I didn't even mean to fire you.

260
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,420
You know? I just got so frustrated,
and, Gob, you are my brother.

261
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,253
- Of course I'm gonna support you.
- Well...

262
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,419
now I feel bad for firing you.

263
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,964
Listen, George Michael is running
for student body president...

264
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,965
and I have a feeling
he's gonna get slaughtered.

265
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,002
The guy he's running against
is basically a young you.

266
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:10,406
Wow. It won't be easy
to win a race against myself.

267
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,342
- Of course, if anyone can do it, I can.
- That's right.

268
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,937
- I wish I was 15 years younger.
- He doesn't need to beat him.

269
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,507
- He just needs to beat the Indian kid.
- If I do this, you'll rehire me?

270
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,383
- Of course I will.
- The mere fact that you think you can...

271
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,617
says to me
that I shouldn't let you.

272
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,923
Course,
we both need the work.

273
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,998
Robot'll get it.

274
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,692
Where the hell is my maid?
Robot!

275
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,259
<i>But the robot was busy elsewhere.</i>

276
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,003
What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine!

277
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,073
I'm a monster!

278
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,651
<i>Michael brought Gob in</i>
<i>to consult on his son's campaign.</i>

279
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,991
Focus on the video and shy away
from the virgin thing.

280
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,964
Oh, we should definitely
sacrifice the whole virgin thing.

281
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,058
<i>And I got the perfect way.</i>

282
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,299
We hand out rubbers that say,
"We salute George Michael."

283
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,500
- We're not supposed to have help.
- I don't wanna make Steve look bad.

284
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,669
Yeah, I just don't want my son to be
embarrassed up there. Let's not play too dirty.

285
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,579
- Uh, good point, two percent.
- Two percent, huh? Is that how little I lost by?

286
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,651
- Lost by? That's all you got.
- Not really important.

287
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,654
<i>Well, if your son wants more than two percent,</i>
<i>he's gonna have to go after Steve Holt.</i>

288
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,487
<i>So I want you to tell me every awful rumor</i>
<i>you've ever heard about this kid.</i>

289
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,027
I can't support this,
and neither can the Christian kids...

290
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,825
- that were gonna make you president.
- Uh-

291
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,833
<i>Ann? I think</i>
<i>she's really upset about this.</i>

292
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,268
She'll forgive ya.
You're George Michael.

293
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,273
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

294
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,343
<i>Maeby was meeting</i>
<i>her new singing nanny.</i>

295
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,207
Now. Take your Fun-fun.

296
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:58,682
This is my mom's, and it's fen-phen,
and it's been banned by the F.D.A.

297
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:03,278
Oh! Well.
You should always read the label

298
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,916
<i>You should always read it well</i>
<i>in the most delicious way</i>

299
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,085
- Mr. Fingerbottom?
- Mrs.

300
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,424
<i>Right. Mrs.</i>
<i>I should really get going.</i>

301
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,125
No, no, no, no, no.
Sit back. What's the rush? Please.

302
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,964
I wanna hear about you.
Tell me about your family.

303
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,632
I'm sure wherever your father is right now,
she loves you very, very much.

304
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,767
Not enough to be honest
with me.

305
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,746
<i>And after a few days, Gob was ready...</i>

306
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,079
<i>to unveil</i>
<i>George Michael's new message.</i>

307
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,983
<i>Drought, starvation</i>-

308
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:40,286
These are the things my family
has had to deal with for generations...

309
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,327
although, fortunately,
not since we moved to Corona del Mar.

310
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,126
<i>Go home, you terrorist!</i>

311
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,962
How stupid do you have to be
to say something like that?

312
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,470
- You're not wanted here!
- Gob.

313
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,439
- Michael.
- You got George Michael's tape?

314
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,444
Yeah. I gave it to the tech guy.
Don't worry. It's very tastefully done.

315
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,447
Sure you didn't make that video in a cave?

316
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,279
<i>- Perennial candidate Steve Holt!</i>
<i>- Soon it was time...</i>

317
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,444
<i>for Steve Holt to play his video...</i>

318
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,819
<i>which had been produced</i>
<i>by his new campaign manager, Ann Veal.</i>

319
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,156
- Hi. I'm Steve Holt.
<i>- Evil!</i>

320
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,492
This kid's popular?

321
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,123
Looks like a chick I did
once in high school.

322
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,293
Get a haircut!

323
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,429
Recently, I've been dealing with the fact
that I've never known my father...

324
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,134
<i>but I finally found a new Father.</i>

325
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,110
You're probably wondering
what these footsteps are.

326
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:39,515
Well, this is my second take. It's kind of
like a second chance at making good.

327
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,518
<i>Yeah. Okay. We need</i>
<i>to pull the videotape.</i>

328
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,990
- My tape?
- Why?
- I've made a huge mistake.

329
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,029
<i>But it was too late</i>
<i>to do anything about it.</i>

330
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,500
Steve Holt is a bastard.
He doesn't even know who his real father is.

331
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:01,335
What else don't we know
about Steve Holt?

332
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,705
George Michael Bluth
is a cool guy.

333
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,075
His dad is a powerful executive
working for this man.

334
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,082
The girls like him just fine.
Young and old. It doesn't matter.

335
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,244
- In the dark.
- That's why you had me do that?

336
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,585
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>had never been more embarrassed.</i>

337
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,352
<i>Until this part.</i>

338
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,519
I couldn't find another tape.

339
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,827
I like Steve's more.

340
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,998
Guess I underestimated
the religious vote.

341
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,271
- So Steve won?
- No. Steve dropped out of the race.

342
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,938
He says he wants to spend some time
trying to find his real father.

343
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,346
Rav Nadir, the Indian kid,
he got 97% of the vote.

344
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,046
Well, that leaves three percent.
You did better than I did when I ran.

345
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,851
I tied with Bart Simpson
and "School Sucks."

346
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,983
I'm really sorry, buddy.
Believe it or not, I did this...

347
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,425
because I didn't want you
to feel bad about yourself.

348
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,259
Hey, it's Star Dork.

349
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,391
Hey, he knows you now.
I'm really sorry, buddy.

350
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,438
It's just a drag. I mean, I'm pretty sure
my girlfriend's gone forever...

351
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,564
and I never wanted
to do this in the first place.

352
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:15,079
George Michael, was that really you
doing those lightsaber moves?

353
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,377
- You were incredible.
- I've only gotten better.

354
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,077
You're still doin' that?

355
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:25,953
<i>So, you wanna grab a curtain rod</i>
<i>and go over to my place?</i>

356
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,118
Wow. I'd love that.
Thanks, Ann.

357
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,322
You really make me
feel good about myself.

358
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,299
Gotta do something
about that kid's self-esteem.

359
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,838
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

360
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,738
Yoo-hoo!
I'll take you the rest of the way!

361
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,611
<i>Lucille finds a housekeeper</i>
<i>that she won't lose her son to.</i>

362
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:55,551
Always keep from crying
even though your heart is dying

363
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,427
<i>And Steve Holt finally</i>
<i>tracks down his real father.</i>

364
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,929
I've been wonderin'
my whole life who he is-

365
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,967
a scientist,
a doctor, a senator?

366
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,128
Well, we got some bad news.

367
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:17,766
Wow. Is that what's
gonna happen to my hair?

Oh, she thinks I'm too critical.
That's another fault of hers.

Ah, yes.

- Really?
- Do you want it?

174
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:21,605
I do now. That'll show her
for trying to punish me.

- No, no.

00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:50,388
You wanted some marijuana?

313
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,431
No, not me.
My nephew did.

314
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:55,160
[Chuckles]
Show me the money.

315
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:03,342
- Show us the pot.
- I got it right here.

316
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:06,435
- Oh, my God.
- Nice, right?

317
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:09,344
Okay, you can put your shirt down, Derek.
just give him the stuff.

318
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:18,850
So. We have a deal.

319
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,859
We have a deal.

320
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:22,861
- <i>[Man] He's ruining his life</i>!
-? [Dance]

321
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:26,694
- <i>[Man #2] Police officers! Freeze!</i>
- What? Oh, no! It's the cops!

322
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,928
- And a construction worker.
- Let's get this party started.

323
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:33,028
- Aren't you guys gonna cuff him?
- You wanted handcuffs?

324
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:37,872
<i>All right. George Michael,</i>
<i>I hope you learned your lesson, pal.</i>

325

- [Hot Cops Cheering]
-? [Continues]

326
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,438
- [Whooping, Cheering]
- Okay.

327
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,883
- Okay, all right. Thank you. Thank you.
<i>-? [Stops]</i>

328
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,887
- What is this?
- This is a lesson.

329
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:51,753
Maybe I pushed you
into this, but...

330
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,292
I love you too much to see you
ruin your life with that crap.

331
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:57,488
- But it wasn't for me.
- Then who was it for?

332
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,565
Who? Give me a name.

333
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,867
- Okay, it was for me.
- Yeah.

334
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,995
I was gonna smoke the marijuana
like a cigarette.

335
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,040
- Now you're looking at a nice big, fat punishment.
- <i>[Footsteps Running]</i>

336
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:12,578
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Ooh! Uh...

337
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,844
- What are you doing here?
- The, uh... The boy was lookin' out for me.

338
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:22,081
- What?
- It-It's for my girlfriend. She's sick.

339
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,748
Why don't you just wait it out?
She's gonna be gone soon. [Laughing]

340
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,418
- Oh, that's it.
- Hey!

341
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,586
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

342
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:32,756
- Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?
- Hey! Buster!

343
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,494
What's the matter with you?
Easy.

344
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:37,627
Is that true?
Why didn't you tell me this?

345
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,763
You're always telling me
to do the right thing... put family first.

346
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:44,708
You know, it is unbelievable
that you'd ask my son to score you pot.

347
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:47,245
Why don't you drive him home,
and you and I will talk about this later.

348
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,713
- Go ahead. Go with Buster.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:53,843
- <i>Hey, what are you guys doin'?</i>
- [Man] We got your signal. You flashed the lights.

350
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:56,217
We got the drugs.
You got the money?

351
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:58,882
No, no. No, no, no, no.
We're all good.

352
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:01,460
[Man] We just want the money,
You wanna make this ugly?

353
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,462
We were just teaching the young fellow
a lesson. We don't want any trouble with you.

354
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:07,124
- Thanks very much.
- Do you know who you're dealin' with?

355
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,669
- [Siren Wails]
- [Man] Drop the boxes! Put your hands in the air.

356
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,068
- What is this?
- [Gob] We had nothin' to do with this!

357
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:16,370
- You set us up!
- No, no! These are just strippers!

358
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:19,138
- Look how hot they are!
- Everybody take a breath!

359
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:22,806
- [All Shouting, Indistinct]
- [Gunshots]

360
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:32,124
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Oh, my God! My arm!</i>

361
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:34,125
Oh, my God!
This guy's arm...

362
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:40,062
just came off
and landed on the dock.

363
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,760
<i>[Narrator] Michael realized</i>
<i>that his father had, once again...</i>

364
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,928
<i>taught him an elaborate lesson.</i>

365
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,031
And that's why you don't
teach lessons to your son.

366
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,736
<i>How could you do that to me?</i>

367
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:55,542
I told you he's a good kid. You should try
talking to him when you think he's in trouble.

368
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:59,448
Don't make the same mistake I did,
you know... teaching lessons.

369
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:01,452
So you taught me a lesson
not to teach lessons?

370
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:04,648
[Sighs]
It was my last lesson.

371
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:10,194
- <i>[Narrator] Back home.</i>
- Back from your wonderful time with Gangy?

372
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:14,027
Well, actually, it wasn't so wonderful.
She can be kinda nasty.

373
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,534
But I'll tell you somethin'.

374
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:19,935
I'm glad you're my mom.

375
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,031
Oh, um,
I got you something.

376
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:25,703
- You're giving me this?
- You deserve it.

377
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:27,973
I can't believe you had
to put up with her your whole life.

378
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:34,385
Honey, this is so sweet.

379
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,478
Let's celebrate and go shopping.

380
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:40,116
- You knew the whole time, didn't you?
- Kind of.

381
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,558
One of the Hot Cops
is my choir teacher.

382
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,597
I'm sorry about all this.
It's just you were so stressed out...

383
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:49,156
and I guess I got scared and...

384
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,635
I should learn to talk with you
a little bit more, huh?

385
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:54,332
- I think we're okay.
- We are, aren't we?

386
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,931
You know there's nothing you can't
be totally honest with me about.

387
00:20:57,043 --> 00:21:00,012
You can say anything to me,
anything at all.

388
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:03,571
Like, say, I had a crush
on my own cousin.

389
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:10,747
Hey.

390
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:14,020

- Oh.

00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:16,493
-<i>? Big yellowjoint</i>
<i>The big yellowjoint?</i>
- All right. We're even.

392
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:20,157

00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,693
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:09,795
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,973
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:23,016
<i>It was Sunday morning,</i>
<i>and Michael was making cornballs.</i>

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,282
<i>A Bluth family favorite since</i>
<i>George Sr. unsuccessfully...</i>

7
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,289
<i>tried to market the device</i>
<i>in the mid-'70s.</i>

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:30,951
Time to pull out the basket
and we dig into some hot...

9
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:33,655
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, look what you did!

10
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:35,230
- You plopped it!
- I'll plop you!

11
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:38,733
<i>It was a ritual Michael shared with his son...</i>

12
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,633
<i>before their weekly</i>
<i>bike ride to Balboa Island.</i>

13
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:44,901
Be careful! Don't touch that.
Never touch that.

14
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:49,240
I'm looking forward to our ride today.
We better go extra hard
to work off these cornballs.

15
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:53,305
Or, you could not eat the cornballs
and let your kid lead his own life.

16
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,350
Please. He loves this. Am I right?

17
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:59,081
Actually, uh, I can't really go today.

18
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,148
- How's that?
- My bike needs a tune-up or something.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,093
Let's not blame the bike, okay?

20
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:11,031
It's the poor carpenter that blames
his shoddy tools for the... Ow!

21
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:14,433
Christ!

22
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:18,941
- That stupid cornballing piece of...
- You okay?

23
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:22,170
- So I'm gonna go, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

24
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:25,544
It's good.
That's okay. Have fun.

25
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,881
- Getting too old for his daddy?
- No. He'll be fine.

26
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:34,116
And I would buy him a faster bike
if we weren't trying to save every...

27
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,692
- Did you go shopping?
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.

28
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:38,954
- Excuse me.
- I paid for it myself.

29
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,189
- With what?
- Company credit card.

30
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:43,528
- You're returning that.
- But...

31
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:46,158
- Get a job.
- Michael. Hey, the Cornballer.

32
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,362
I thought these things
were only legal in Mexico.

33
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:50,962
<i>In fact, the Cornballer</i>
<i>wasn't legal anywhere.</i>

34
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:54,100
<i>But George Sr. continued</i>
<i>to market it there successfully.</i>

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,804
- <i>Muy delicioso.</i>
- Es verdad.

36
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:03,816
- Where'd you come from?
- I had another big fight with Marta.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,821
<i>Gob had been having an</i>
<i>on-again, off-again relationship...</i>

38
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,982
<i>with Marta, a Spanish-language</i>
<i>soap opera star.</i>

39
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:12,391
It looks like I'm going to be
staying here for a while.

40
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:15,987
No, it doesn't. It doesn't look like that.
I've got a full house here, Gob.

41
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,001
<i>He's just in a bad mood, Gob,</i>
<i>because his son feels suffocated by him.</i>

42
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,537
- Suffocated? Really?
- <i>Yes, Michael. He's a teenager.</i>

43
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,938
He's probably got a little girlfriend,
and, well, let's face it...

44
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:30,035
- you are overbearing.
- Maybe I should be more like
you when it comes to parenting.

45
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:34,276
No borders. No limits. "Go ahead,
touch the Cornballer. You know best."

46
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:38,718
Michael, if I could stick my
pretty little nose in here for one second.

47
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:42,952
When I was a psychiatrist...
and this is before I became an actor...

48
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,527
- You're still not an actor.
- Lovely.

49
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,563
I saw a lot of this type of behavior...

50
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:52,294
and I think what you're experiencing is
your son's very normal need...

51
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:56,600
to distance himself from
his overbearing father.

52
00:02:56,706 --> 00:03:00,335
<i>Am I touching something?</i>
<i>Hot! Hot, hot. Hot.</i>

53
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:04,174
- <i>Be careful.</i>
- Hot.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,716
- <i>You all right?</i>
- Hot.

55
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:10,547
Now, take my daughter, for example.

56
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:12,713
She lives her life...

57
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:16,553
and I get the pleasure of
guessing what that might entail.

58
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,620
<i>Now watch this. Maeby, where are you</i>
<i>off to on this glorious Sunday afternoon?</i>

59
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,495
- She won't tell me.
- I'm going to audition for a play.

60
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,502
Well, that time it didn't work.
What play?

61
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,731
It's for high school.
You can't audition.

62
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,501
I was totally wrong.

63
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,911
She's reaching out to her actor daddy.
Does anyone have an ice pack?

64
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:41,643
<i>In truth, Maeby was reaching</i>
<i>out to a boy named Steve Holt...</i>

65
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:44,083
<i>who was auditioning for</i>
<i>the lead in the school play.</i>

66
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:46,621
"I would kiss before I spoke."

67
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:50,181
<i>Maeby decided to audition as well...</i>

68
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,659
<i>Iooking for a chance</i>
<i>to get closer to Steve.</i>

69
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:54,354
And then we actually
get to kiss, right?

70
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:57,092
<i>George Michael also chose to audition...</i>

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,760
<i>Iooking for a chance</i>
<i>to get closer to his cousin Maeby.</i>

72
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:02,997
"I would kiss before I spoke."
Then there's a kiss, right?

73
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,768
- <i>Louder.</i>
- And then there's a kiss, right?

74
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,936
- <i>Later, the cast list was posted.</i>
- Steve Holt!

75
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:14,608
- Steve Holt!
- Stand-in for Steve Holt?

76
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:17,278
Steve Holt!

77
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:24,086
<i>Michael went to get his son</i>
<i>a new bike to keep him from slipping away...</i>

78
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:27,527
<i>while Michael's mother was giving up hope</i>
<i>her son Buster would ever leave her side.</i>

79
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,621
Zip me up.

80
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,361
<i>Usually at this time of year...</i>

81
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,131
<i>Buster would return to</i>
<i>his post-graduate studies.</i>

82
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:37,968
<i>But without the resources to afford it...</i>

83
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:41,134
<i>his summer vacation</i>
<i>was extending into the fall.</i>

84
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:43,474
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

85
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:49,481
<i>And Lucille was beginning to resent it.</i>

86
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,554
What?

87
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:54,782
Hi, Mama, it's Linds.

88
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:58,827
It'll fly out on its own.
Why are you calling me? What do you need?

89
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,726
Very nice, Mom.
I don't need anything.

90
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:04,493
My daughter needs
some new school clothes.

91
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,899
Buster!

92
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,461
- It's a bird.
- I know it's a bird. I'm on the phone.

93
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:14,236
- It walked on my pillow.
- Look, I have a child that
costs me money too, you know.

94
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:17,404
- Why can't you get a job?
- What is it with this family and working?

95
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:20,506
Michael just gave me the exact
same lecture in front of everybody.

96
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:23,142
Everybody? Who's everybody?

97
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:27,019
- Who's everybody?
- You know, the kids, Gob, Tobias, everybody.

98
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:29,751
He didn't invite Buster.

99
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,487
Buster's his brother too.
What's wrong with Buster?

100
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:35,223
<i>And even as she asked</i>
<i>the question, Lucille realized...</i>

101
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:38,698
<i>that perhaps it was time to</i>
<i>let her own baby bird fly away.</i>

102
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:40,633
- Why do I have to take him?
- <i>Because he's your brother.</i>

103
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:44,867
You run around with everyone else,
going on bike rides, making cornholes.

104
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:49,707
- Mom, listen...
- Everyone's laughing, riding
and cornholing except Buster.

105
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:54,011
And I know he's not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, but he's sensitive, Michael...

106
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:56,745
and you could pretend
to be interested in him.

107
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:59,981
Fine. He can hang out,
but he's going to work, okay?

108
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,887
This is not going to be
a day at the beach.

109
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:06,325
Th-That's cool. Mom packed me
a change of clothes.

110
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:11,457
<i>So Buster stayed and Michael</i>
<i>made him build the new bike.</i>

111
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:15,197
- It's in the big box in my office. Hey.
- Michael.

112
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:19,105
Gob, what are you doing here,
and why are you in a bathrobe?

113
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,007
What's he doing here?
Why is he in his bathing suit?

114
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,579
Mom dropped me off
to spend time with Michael.

115
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,980
Spend time with Michael,
or to serve her own menopausal needs?

116
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:31,576
She's always got to wedge herself in
the middle of us, so she can control everything.

117
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:36,421
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Mom's awesome.</i>

118
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,426
Maybe we should call her.

119
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,593
- So why are you in your robe?
- I camped out in the boardroom last night.

120
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,101
What with you kicking me
out of your house...

121
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,103
there are few places left
that you have that I can stay.

122
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,834
Hmm. Well, you can't stay here either.

123
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:56,400
Let me ask you something.

124
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:59,811
Is this a business decision, or is it personal?

125
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,714
'Cause if it's business,
I'll go away happily.

126
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,620
But if it's personal, I'll go away.
But I won't be happy.

127
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,754
It's personal.

128
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,398
I am so sorry.

129
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:20,435
<i>Michael's son, meanwhile, was</i>
<i>waiting with his cousin for first rehearsal.</i>

130
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:24,302
- I'm surprised you tried out for this.
- Yeah. I just love the theater.

131
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,568
That's great. I'm just doing it
to kiss Steve Holt.

132
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:30,976
Well, actually, I think I'm gonna quit.
Yeah, theater's dead.

133
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,481
But, he's always going to be at football
practice, so I'm gonna have to kiss the stand-in.

134
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:38,213
But, no. No. I love the theater...

135
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:42,553
and I gave my word, so I'm back in.

136
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,560
<i>Tobias, meanwhile,</i>
<i>stopped by the school.</i>

137
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:49,621
- I know why you're doing this.
- Dad. What are you doing here? Go away.

138
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:53,725
Yes, because the director
might be here soon, right? Oops. Too late.

139
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:55,736
He's already here.

140
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,968
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to the theater.

141
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:05,814
I am Dr. Tobias Fünke...

142
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:10,375
and I will be your new director.

143
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,852
Oh, my God.

144
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,587
<i>Tobias had gotten the directing</i>
<i>job by meeting with the school principal.</i>

145
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,856
And you tell me you've got
some P.E. teacher directing?

146
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,422
That just makes me wanna
puke all over your head, sir.

147
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:28,334
Give me a chance
to tell the Bard's tale...

148
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:30,565
and I give you my word
on humble knee...

149
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:35,872
whence you shall not say
it wasn't e'er to be.

150
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,938
- Jerry, you cool with this?
- Sure. Let the little fruit do it.

151
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,677
- Huzzah!
- <i>As the days went by...</i>

152
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:47,085
<i>Buster's apprenticeship was proving</i>
<i>more trying than Michael had anticipated.</i>

153
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,681
We're excited. We want your business.

154
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:57,455
And, uh, everybody at the Bluth Company...

155
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,398
Here I go again.

156
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:04,530
<i>Andjust when</i>
<i>he could take no more</i>...

157
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,609
And we're back on track. And we're focused.

158
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,610
And, Buster...

159
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:13,705
<i>you can't do that</i>
<i>in the snack room, pal?</i>

160
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:16,080
Mom told me to
stay away from microwaves.

161
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:18,813
<i>And besides, this is gonna be...</i>

162
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:22,413
the most bitchingly fast bike
in all of Orange County.

163
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,993
- Really?
- Your son is gonna love it.

164
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:30,225
Well, I guess 3:40 is as good a time
as any to call it a day.

165
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,598
<i>So Michael left for the high school</i>
<i>hoping to reconnect with his son...</i>

166
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:38,834
<i>while Tobias's attempt to reconnect with</i>
<i>his daughter hit a snag.</i>

167
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,341
Stop! Stop it. It's all wrong.

168
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:43,776
- But we were just about to do the kiss...
- <i>Kiss. I know.</i>

169
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,214
It doesn't work. Look, you are
playing adults with fully...

170
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:53,179
Pick that up, please.
With fully formed libidos...

171
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,918
<i>not two young men</i>
<i>playing grab-ass in the shower.</i>

172
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:01,622
Would you hold the work, please? Oh, Michael.

173
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:04,962
- Dad, wh...
- So, you're in a play, huh?

174
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:06,968
<i>I'm not.</i>

175
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,301
- I quit.
- Maeby.

176
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,141
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's not really important.

177
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:17,804
- I'm just a stand-in.
- And you're ashamed?

178
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:21,213
Well, this should
cheer you up. Hmm?

179
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,478
I left work early. I thought maybe
we'd go for a ride today.

180
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:27,488
- No, I can't go on a bike ride right now.
- Why, because of the play?

181
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,388
- You're just a stand-in.
- No, no. It's not the play. It's just...

182
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:34,293
You know, I can't go on a million bike rides
whenever you want me to.

183
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:37,662
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hey, is it about a girl?

184
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,792
- No! It's not. Just drop it, Dad.
- You can tell me.

185
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:44,329
What, is Lindsay right?
Am I really suffocating him?

186
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,776
Well, they're different people every day,
teenagers. Hormones all ablaze.

187
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,347
Except, of course,
when they're onstage when I need it.

188
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:55,076
No, he said it wasn't about a girl.

189
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,846
Maybe he really is pulling away.

190
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,519
Not a girl?

191
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,083
Of course.

192
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:12,331
Methinks a Cupid I shall play.

193
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,262
Mm. Mmm. Mmm.

194
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:23,274
<i>Tobias came up with</i>
<i>a new plan for the play...</i>

195
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,542
- <i>and a way to connect to George Michael.</i>
- I know why you're in the play.

196
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,913
- What?
- Watch this.

197
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:32,146
Okay, everybody.
Well, we've lost a leading lady...

198
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:36,055
but did you know in Shakespeare's day
that the women's roles...

199
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,787
were played by men?

200
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:40,988
Fancy that.

201
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,532
Hmm.

202
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,432
George Michael,
you know Steven's lines, yes?

203
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:49,562
- Sort of.
- Fine. Then you are my Benedict.

204
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:52,971
- And Steven Holt... Where is Steven Holt?
- Steve Holt!

205
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:56,875
Yes. Get ready for the acting challenge
of your sweet young life, fair lady.

206
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,004
For you are my Beatrice.

207
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,606
Beatrice!

208
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:05,517
Let's take it from "Peace,
I will stop thy mouth."

209
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:09,580
Now we'll see if some sparks fly.

210
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,992
<i>As George Michael</i>
<i>contemplated kissing his rival...</i>

211
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,927
<i>Michael sought his father's advice.</i>

212
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:19,832
- You think you never hurt me?
- What are you talking about?
When have I ever rebelled?

213
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:22,905
- I never see you anymore, Michael.
- You're in prison.

214
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,939
And I was here yesterday.

215
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,204
Oh, yeah. That's-That's... I'm sorry.

216
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:31,644
I couldn't break away from the poker game.
Capital "G" was down to his boxers.

217
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,716
- Strip poker?
- Yeah, and it's tough.

218
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:38,218
We can really
only play about two hands.

219
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,217
Listen...

220
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:45,852
Let him go. Let your son go.

221
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:48,362
I can't do that, Dad. He needs me.

222
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:51,831
Michael, you don't want to make
the same mistake your mom made with Buster.

223
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:55,062
- Yeah, boy. What happened there?
- <i>I really don't know.</i>

224
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:58,299
Maybe it was the 11 months
he spent in the womb.

225
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,205
The doctor said there were claw marks
on the walls of her uterus, but...

226
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,746
he was our miracle baby, you know?

227
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,407
And l-I was just too burned out
on raising you guys to care.

228
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:10,485
So, he turned out a little, uh, soft.

229
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,885
A little doughy.

230
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,117
I don't know. Maybe-Maybe it was my fault.

231
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:20,025
Maybe I just ignored the guy.

232
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:26,334
Wow. We're just blowing
through nap time, aren't we?

233
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:31,172
Yeah, I gotta let my son go.

234
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,903
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,</i>
<i>still had the dress...</i>

235
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:40,574
- <i>and she was starting to get</i>
<i>some positive reactions to it.</i>
- Look at you.

236
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:43,345
I am.

237
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:46,580
<i>So she decided to hide it</i>
<i>in the attic crawl space.</i>

238
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:02,796
Are you crazy? I'm a magician.
I make my living with my hands.

239
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:05,874
- And if I'm going to be staying here...
- Staying here?

240
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,567
What, did that Mexican throw you out?

241
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:11,135
She's not "that Mexican," Mom.
She's my Mexican.

242
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,977
And she's Colombian or something.
Anyway, it's over.

243
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,381
- You've got three days.
- Hey.

244
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,784
If I can't find a horny immigrant by then,
I don't deserve to stay here.

245
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,155
Oh!

246
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,558
<i>Back at the model home,</i>
<i>Michael was adjusting to...</i>

247
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:29,563
<i>the absence ofhis son,</i>
<i>by enjoying the company ofhis brother.</i>

248
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:31,565
You know, I'm in pretty good shape.

249
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,636
You could be eating my dust
all day, slowpoke.

250
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:37,297
<i>And Buster was starting</i>
<i>to give as good as he got.</i>

251
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,840
Yeah. And you might be eating...

252
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:48,479
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

253
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:52,816
Hey, Tobias. How's my son doing?

254
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:55,618
Oh, well, he didn't want to
rehearse today...

255
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:58,853
but I do think I have a handle
on what he's going through.

256
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:02,419
I wish I could say the same for Steve Holt.
I don't know what the hell her problem is.

257
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,658
- Her?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:09,033
I say that because I switched the parts,
but, it's still...

259
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:11,197
off.

260
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:14,276
Perhaps if she dressed as a woman.

261
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:18,871
- She?
- Oh, for the love of God. She's playing a woman.

262
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,819
Look who's back.

263
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,958
- I'm exhausted.
- Neiman's again, huh?

264
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,256
I've been going to the thrift store,
but I'm going to find a way to keep that dress.

265
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:36,331
Things didn't work out with Mom.

266
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:39,890
It was utterly macabre.

267
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,038
Zip me up.

268
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,139
She always makes everything about her.

269
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,906
She's the last person I ever want to
need something from.

270
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,379
Well, she likes to be needed, just as
long as it doesn't cost her anything.

271
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:56,315
It's like she gets off
on being withholding.

272
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:00,254
- Whoa. Buster.
- Look who's got something to say.

273
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:07,028
I'm Mom, and I wanna shoot down everything
you say so I feel good about myself.

274
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,587
Look who's ragging on the old lady.

275
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,894
- Hey, hey.
- Finally.

276
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:16,403
'Cause I'm an uptight...

277
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,170
<i>Buster!</i>

278
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,267
You old horny slut!

279
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:29,112
Well, no one's gonna top that.

280
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:35,016
<i>And Tobias had found</i>
<i>the perfect wardrobe for his leading man.</i>

281
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:39,584
<i>The red dress he discovered</i>
<i>in the attic crawl space.</i>

282
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,788
<i>Assuming Michael had found and returned it...</i>

283
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:45,298
- <i>Lindsay called her mother, hoping to</i>
<i>get money for a new one.</i>
- What?

284
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,631
- Hi, Mama. It's Linds.
- Get a job.

285
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:51,797
Look. Just hear me out. It's Maeby's dress.
It was stolen from her locker.

286
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:56,139
They beat her up,
and, uh, took all her clothes.

287
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:58,713
- Send her over. I'll take her shopping.
- Buster was right.

288
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,714
You get off on being
withholding, don't you?

289
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:03,444
- Buster said that?
- That's right.

290
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:06,487
- My Buster?
- Not anymore, apparently.

291
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,717
<i>While Lucille</i>
<i>was missing her youngest son...</i>

292
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:13,420
- <i>Michael was finally enjoying his company.</i>
- Zip me up.

293
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,396
<i>And while Buster did build a faster bike...</i>

294
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:18,660
- Whoo!
- <i>he neglected to build the brakes.</i>

295
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,735
I'm flying!

296
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,963
Buster?

297
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:25,370
<i>And George Michael had news for Maeby.</i>

298
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:28,739
So, I quit the play.
I don't really like plays.

299
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:31,472
Also, I think your dad thinks I'm gay.

300
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,310
- Oh. He thinks everyone's gay.
- Do you wanna get a soda?

301
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,943
I can't. I'm actually back in the play.
We're in the middle of dress rehearsal now.

302
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:41,614
- But I thought Steve had your part.
- <i>Steve did have Maeby's part.</i>

303
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,954
<i>And Tobias had given Maeby a new part.</i>

304
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,993
So you want me to play the man?

305
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,258
Yes. Don't you see?
l-I cast the parts all wrong.

306
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,492
<i>It was Daddy's fault.</i>

307
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,092
And I still get to kiss Steve, right?

308
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:59,766
It's gonna be a huge disaster.
I'll get you tickets.

309
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,435
<i>And Michael tried to salvage</i>
<i>what was left of the day...</i>

310
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:05,844
- <i>with what was left ofhis brother.</i>
- I'm a little shaky, but...

311
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,449
- but we're here to work.
- Michael.

312
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,416
- but we're here to work.
- Michael.

313
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,485
- Mom.
- What are you doing here?

314
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:14,386
Oh. Hello, Buster.
Here's a candy bar.

315
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,185
- Oh...
- No. I'm withholding it.

316
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:20,991
Look at me getting off.
How dare you turn Buster against me.

317
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,826
- What are you talking about?
- <i>I know what you've all been saying.</i>

318
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:27,061
But I'm not going to let you destroy
my relationship with my son...

319
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:29,637
just because you don't have one
with yours right now.

320
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:32,070
Wait a minute.
Me and my son are fine...

321
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:34,404
and that is not what this is.

322
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,705
Buster is a grown man.
He can make his own decisions.

323
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:41,374
- Why don't you ask Buster what he wants.
- Michael. I wanna go with Mom.

324
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:50,582
- You said that she shoots you down.
- I was trying to fit in.

325
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,586
You were flying today, buddy.

326
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,666
Yes, I was flying...

327
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:00,360
but a little too close to the sun.

328
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:04,098
You let him go in the sun?
Get in the backseat. I'll be right out.

329
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:09,872
Front seat, Mom. I sit in
the front seat now. Mmm?

330
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:18,353
Let me tell you something, Michael.
You have to fight for your family.

331
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:22,117
If you were smart, you'd grab your son
before he slips any further away.

332
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:24,852
Well, I disagree, Mom.

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,258
I'm not gonna control George Michael.

334
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:29,661
I'm gonna let him
decide for himself what's best.

335
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:32,233
Mm-hmm. Well, you better hope...

336
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:36,293
that little bird decides to
fly back into your house.

337
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,236
Because they usually don't.

338
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:51,920
So, uh, can we go now?

339
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,024
Yeah.

340
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:02,496
<i>And George Michael watched</i>
<i>as Maeby shared the kiss...</i>

341
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:06,159
<i>that should've been his with</i>
<i>a boy</i> he <i>almost had to kiss.</i>

342
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:15,673
<i>But, to Maeby's surprise,</i>
<i>she did not enjoy kissing Steve Holt.</i>

343
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,575
You smell like my mom.

344
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,116
<i>Michael returned to the model home</i>
<i>to find his son in the kitchen.</i>

345
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:24,481
- You're home.
- <i>Yeah. I was waiting for you.</i>

346
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:28,386
- I thought we could make some of these.
- Sure.

347
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:38,357
I'm sorry about what I said at the school.
It was out of line.

348
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,935
I shouldn't have poked my nose into your life.

349
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:44,199
- My life?
- I know that you're growing up.

350
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:47,764
Yeah, but, Dad, you're, like,
the most important part of my life.

351
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:52,677
That's a little cornball.

352
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,841
- I don't mind.
- I don't mind either, buddy.

353
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,820
- Watch your...
- Mother of God!

354
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:03,221
Oh! Every damn time!

355
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:06,488
Oh! This is a big one. Oh!

356
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,961
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

357
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:11,430
<i>Tobias gets a review</i>
<i>ofhis Shakespeare play.</i>

358
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:15,094
I didn't get into this business to please
sophomore Tracy Schwarzman, so...

359
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:17,229
onward and upward!

360
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,365
On...

361
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:23,741
Why, Tracy? Why?

362
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:26,178
<i>And Buster is back</i>
<i>where he belongs.</i>

363
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:29,682
- <i>Mom!</i>
- What is it?

364
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,253
I can't get down.

1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,395
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,344
<i>Michael Bluth had set up</i>
<i>a meeting with Cal Cullen...</i>

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,254
<i>owner of one of the largest</i>
<i>parcels ofland in Orange County.</i>

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,590
I hope that I can prove to you
that we have a very impressive company.

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,530
Well, your family did not come off well
on last night's <i>Scandalmakers.</i>

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,533
Scandalmakers <i>was a show...</i>

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,103
<i>that reenacted</i>
<i>headline-grabbing stories.</i>

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,104
<i>The latest was</i>
<i>about the Bluth family...</i>

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,470
<i>the rights of which had been</i>
<i>signed away by Tobias...</i>

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,442
<i>in exchange for the part of George Sr.</i>

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,208
<i>When allegations</i>
<i>surfaced he'd illegally built homes in Iraq...</i>

15
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,113
<i>George Bluth Sr.,</i>
<i>assisted by his secretary, Kitty...</i>

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,118
<i>escaped the country.</i>

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,281
<i>Due to poor acting, the burden</i>
<i>of the story was placed on the narrator.</i>

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>Only to be found hiding</i>
<i>under one of the homes that he built.</i>

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,892
<i>He was actually found</i>
<i>in a hole near the house...</i>

20
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>but this inattention</i>
<i>to detail was typical...</i>

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,965
- <i>of the laziness the show's</i>
<i>narrator was known for.</i>
- I can't survive under the house.

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,131
Perhaps an attic shall I seek.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
<i>Real shoddy narrating.</i>
<i>Just pure crap.</i>

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,644
But we're back on track,
and we are scandal-free.

25
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,443
<i>Hey! You start</i>
<i>the meeting without me?</i>

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,680
Mother, uh, this is Cal Cullen.
You remember my mother, Lucille.

27
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,255
We're right in the middle of talking...

28
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,620
about this exciting giveaway
spa package to entice buyers.

29
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,920
You know, he's never taken me anywhere.

30
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,997
Oh, no. We have to live high and dry.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,123
Well, you're certainly not dry.

32
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,829
<i>Michael, I'm not a prude, but it's 1:00</i>
<i>in the afternoon. Is your mother drunk?</i>

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,032
<i>I'd have to get up pretty early</i>
<i>to get drunk by 1:00.</i>

34
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,632
<i>As it turns out,</i>
<i>she had gotten up early...</i>

35
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,179
<i>and had taken pain medication</i>
<i>because of a hangover-related headache.</i>

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,148
<i>However, she mistook</i>
<i>the "drowsy eye"alcohol warning...</i>

37
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,743
<i>for a "winking eye"alcohol suggestion.</i>

38
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,882
<i>Fortunately, she had the good sense</i>
<i>not to drive herself to the meeting.</i>

39
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,256
No. I'll call for a car.

40
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:13,025
<i>Unfortunately, this was</i>
<i>after a failed attempt to do so.</i>

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,533
Who the hell put-

42
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,729
<i>Michael, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I cannot do business with you.</i>

43
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,568
I mean, I couldn't afford
to end up on <i>Scandalmakers.</i>

44
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,643
Oh, you could afford to do anything
you want. You're just a big chicken.

45
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,651
<i>Michael realized it might be time...</i>

46
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,812
<i>to deal with his mother's</i>
<i>apparent problem.</i>

47
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,982
Okay, that seems as good a place
as any to end the meeting.

48
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,760
No, I'm not doing another
intervention with her.

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,923
Last time, I felt terrible for a week.

50
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,230
<i>One year earlier,</i>
<i>the family had tried an intervention.</i>

51
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,237
- You're pouring a drink? What are you doing?
- What if she's mad?

52
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,240
- Good point.
- Perhaps I'll have a little sip of something.

53
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,572
Guys, what could she do to us?

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,040
Do we have anything single malt?

55
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,049
<i>And although</i>
<i>the intervention didn't work</i>-

56
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,348
- We think you have a "prollen."
- You're a mesh.

57
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,423
<i>It turned into one</i>
<i>of the Bluth family's better parties.</i>

58
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,066
<i>Well, maybe an intervention</i>
<i>is the wrong approach.</i>

59
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,568
What about rehab?
She was just a mess at the meeting.

60
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,435
Where were you, by the way?
I could've used your help with Mom.

61
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,271
I believe I told you I was gonna be out
for the holidays. It's spring break.

62
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,073
Not that I can enjoy it.
My reputation's been ruined...

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,207
by that jerk Phillip Litt, who put
my one magic show flub on his DVD.

64
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,082
<i>Gob had performed a magic act</i>
<i>at an earlier spring break...</i>

65
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,554
<i>to get exposure on the</i>
<i>best-selling video series...</i>

66
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,625
<i>Girls with Low Self-Esteem.</i>

67
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,990
Or two flubs or whatever.

68
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,997
<i>There were seven flubs...</i>

69
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,294
<i>and after the show,</i>
<i>he signed a release.</i>

70
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,235
- You're not gonna use the time
that I screwed up, right?
- That wasn't part of the act?

71
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,035
Come on, man.
I'd never do anything to embarrass you.

72
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,041
Please.

73
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,178
Oh. Uh, you don't know
a good bird hospital, do you?

74
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,182
You're getting all this, right?

75
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,015
<i>Well, at least the</i> Orange County Register
<i>didn't say of your performance...</i>

76
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:19,023
"If this is who George Sr. Is,
let's hope he remains missing."

77
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,060
Meanwhile, they loved
Dave Attell's risky choice...

78
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,721
of wearing cutoffs
while portraying me.

79
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,992
<i>In fact, Mr. Attell was portraying...</i>

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,660
<i>Tobias's actual never-nude affliction...</i>

81
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,237
<i>but this perplexed</i>
<i>the</i> Scandalmakers <i>audience...</i>

82
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,240
<i>due to the unfocused nature</i>
<i>of the narrator's explanation.</i>

83
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,903
No, I think mine's worse. You should've seen
what happened to me on the boardwalk today.

84
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,538
They were laughing at me. Me!

85
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,215
Those tapes are awful.
Women tricked into taking their tops off.

86
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,017
I have a daughter I don't want
corrupted by the media.

87
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,785
<i>Unbeknownst to Lindsay...</i>

88
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,985
<i>Maeby was a fairly prominent</i>
<i>member of the media...</i>

89
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:59,861
<i>as she had secretly conned her way</i>
<i>into a job as a film executive.</i>

90
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,866
This <i>Young Man on the Beach</i>
script sucks.

91
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,902
She'd go to the guy just
'cause he said she's awesome?

92
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,699
- You call that dialogue?
- Hey, I didn't write it.

93
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,333
No, but you're gonna fix it. It's a spring break
movie. Find out what they sound like.

94
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,378
Oh, yeah, right. Do you really
think I look college-aged?

95
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,710
I'm not drunk.
But I'm willing to be. Hint.

96
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,149
Oh, Mort, you're gonna be
so easy to blackmail. Hint.

97
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,988
This pig Phillip Litt is out there
asking girls to take their tops off.

98
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:32,121
- It's an outrage.
- Well, of course you feel that way. You're jealous.

99
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,496
You're a surfboard.
But I do agree he is a pig.

100
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,501
Hey! What the hell was that for?

101
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,867
Can we stop worrying about girls
with low self-esteem...

102
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,066
and start focusing on sobering up
the woman who gave us ours?

103
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,510
- What do you think about rehab?
- She won't go willingly. I can tell you that.

104
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,242
May I make a suggestion?
Get implants. Really.

105
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,512
Wha- Come on!
This stuff is expensive!

106
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,918
<i>So Michael set out to convince</i>
<i>his mother that she needed help.</i>

107
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,924
Hello? Hello?
I have a surprise for you.

108
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,187
- Did I win the prize?
- You won the prize.

109
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,095
I won the prize!
I won the prize! For what?

110
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,690
We were gonna give
one employee a week at the spa.

111
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,361
We were even gonna put them
in the ad, but then I thought...

112
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,871
"What about Mom?
She's elegant. She deserves it."

113
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,203
I was gonna tell you at the office,
but then I thought...

114
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,746
"No. If I bring her around now,
she might vomit on the overhead projector."

115
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,874
I'm so embarrassed about that. I don't think
I was supposed to drink with my medication.

116
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,919
<i>Actually, it wasn't even</i> her <i>medication.</i>

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,454
Of course, I can't take Oscar
to an elegant place.

118
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,821
His only remaining pair of pants
blew apart the other day.

119
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,759
I was thinking that I would
go with you for the week.

120
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,959
So what? I just stay here alone? I'm not
exactly equipped to run this place by myself!

121
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,126
You can't just
leave me here alone!

122
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,570
Have a great trip.

123
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,073
<i>But it wouldn't turn out</i>
<i>to be a great trip at all.</i>

124
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,838
Hello. Welcome to Shady Pines Rehab.
Just sign right here.

125
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,709
Rehab? This isn't a spa.
This isn't a spa!

126
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,409
- Come here. Wait. Get her. Come here, Mom!
- We got a runner!

127
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,453
<i>As Michael's mother</i>
<i>was being held against her will...</i>

128
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:05,081
<i>George Sr. Was about to be confronted</i>
<i>with a similar problem.</i>

129
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,091
Kitty. How'd you find me?

130
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,754
I thought you were dead
until I saw <i>Scandalmakers!</i>

131
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,629
They got so much wrong. But something
about your son-in-law's comment...

132
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:19,330
<i>"Perhaps an attic shall I seek,"</i>
<i>had the ring of truth to it.</i>

133
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,498
<i>Notice it</i> wasn't
<i>something the narrator said.</i>

134
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,601
- You abandoned me in Mexico!
- Kitty, honey, l-I know you're mad.

135
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,442
Stop talking, George.
You stop talking!

136
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,780
I am in charge now.
You're coming with me.

137
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,376
No, I can't. I ca-
I have a life here.

138
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,787
There are people who-
who depend on me.

139
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,325
Fine. But I can't make
any promises...

140
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,362
about what happens to that
cooler of evidence I have.

141
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,366
If I could just have
a moment to say good-bye.

142
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,303
<i>Meanwhile, at the banana stand...</i>

143
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,635
<i>Maeby was hoping to find</i>
<i>some witty banter...</i>

144
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,140
<i>with which to authenticate</i>
<i>her feature film.</i>

145
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,768
I want the hot chick to serve me.

146
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,177
What other words would you
use to describe me?

147
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,249
- Um, she's 15, and she's my cousin.
- So?

148
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,979
So you can't touch
your cousin- my cousin.

149
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,180
You know, you don't
have to stick around.

150
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,986
I could just work late tonight. It doesn't
matter, 'cause my girlfriend, she's out of town.

151
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,993
She's actually kind of lucky in the end...

152
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,586
'cause all these guys
would be coming on to her.

153
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,360
Yeah, you really
dodged a bullet there.

154
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:25,335
<i>Nearby, Phillip Litt</i>
<i>was making his latest video.</i>

155
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,669
Everybody gather around!
Gather around! Ladies, here's the deal.

156
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,106
We have hats. You have breasts.

157
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,576
You show your breasts,
you get a hat, okay?

158
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,240
So if anyone wants to get back
at Daddy, now's the time.

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,844
- Whoo! Wait. Cut, cut.
We got a surfboard in the shot.
- <i>Surfboard. Stop tape.</i>

160
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,548
We're here to stop you from
taking advantage of these girls.

161
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,856
You know what? You're sassy. You're sexy.
You speak your mind. There's nothin' hotter.

162
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,796
- Give her a hat, Barry.
- I don't want a hat.
I want you to leave these women alone.

163
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,868
I'm giving them a chance
to be idolized...

164
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,198
which is an opportunity these women
are never gonna have again.

165
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,431
- I want to be ideolized.
<i>- Yeah, you do!</i>

166
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,203
Eileen, stop it.
You've got nothing to gain from that.

167
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,904
That's easy for you to say.
You already have a hat.

168
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,379
<i>Come on, girls!</i>

169
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,781
This is no way to get
your daddies to notice you!

170
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,854
<i>Nearby, Lindsay's</i>
<i>own daddy failed to notice her...</i>

171
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,719
<i>as he was being taken</i>
<i>to a local motel...</i>

172
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,157
<i>where he refused</i>
<i>Kitty's sexual advances.</i>

173
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,220
You promised me power
and a child, and I have neither.

174
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,167
I'm gonna take care
of this problem... on my own.

175
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,340
You never promise crazy a baby.

176
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,072
<i>George Sr. Was abandoned</i>
<i>and longed for Lucille...</i>

177
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,513
<i>and Buster felt the same way.</i>

178
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:50,679
<i>Upon her knee</i>

179
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,092
- <i>So fine to be</i>
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

180
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,756
<i>Mother and boy</i>

181
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,765
<i>Restless, Buster went to the kitchen...</i>

182
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,801
<i>to find something to help him sleep...</i>

183
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,202
- <i>when he came across Lucille's</i>
<i>emergency stash of wine</i>-
- <i>Motherboy</i>

184
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,298
<i>which he mistook</i>
<i>for a giantjuice box.</i>

185
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:18,609
<i>It was the first taste of alcohol</i>
<i>Buster had since he was nursing.</i>

186
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,652
- Mama!

187
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,653
<i>And Michael, his mother</i>
<i>no longer a threat...</i>

188
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,690
- Thank you so much for your understanding, sir.
- <i>met again with Cal Cullen.</i>

189
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,625
As I mentioned on the phone,
she did seek help.

190
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,657
And it was extremely moving when she
finally admitted that she has a problem.

191
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,895
We'll take good care of you
here at Shady Pines.

192
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,904
I'll take care of you,
you son of a-

193
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,373
Shady Pines is a wonderful
facility up there on the hill.

194
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,310
- You know, they used to film <i>Sugarfoot</i> up there.
- No?

195
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,473
- Were you a fan of <i>Sugarfoot?</i>
- I loved it.

196
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,448
Sugarfoot <i>had been off the air...</i>

197
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,712
<i>12 years before Michael was born.</i>

198
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,983
Sing the theme song
of <i>Sugarfoot</i> along with me.

199
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,390
- Yes

200
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,233
Oh, what the hell.
You're a good kid.

201
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,236
Let's make the deal.

202
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,238
- Oh, great. I've got papers-
<i>- Michael!</i>

203
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,468
Remember me? Perhaps
this'll jog your memory.

204
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,704
- Oh! They're crooked.
- I've kidnapped your father, Michael...

205
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,008
and I have a cooler full of evidence...

206
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,413
that will bring down
this corrupt company.

207
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:30,217
Unless your mother meets me
today at 4:00 at Señor Tadpole's.

208
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,553
Spring break. Whoo!

209
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,625
Dad?
- <i>Michael's father</i>
<i>hadjust been kidnapped.</i>

210
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,801
Hello?

211
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,137
<i>And then he received a call that</i>
<i>his brother had been found drunk.</i>

212
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,039
No, I'm fine. I'm telling you.

213
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,375
For the first time, I realize that
maybe I am better off without her!

214
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,712
- Yeah, well, we've gotta bring her back.
- Oh, thank God!

215
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,082
So if we want to get
that evidence back, and Dad...

216
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,212
Kitty is insisting
on a meeting with Mom.

217
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,723
- What can Mom do for her?
- I don't know. I've gotta get
my hands on that evidence.

218
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,726
Problem is I just
checked her into rehab.

219
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,989
They're not exactly gonna
let me take her to a bar.

220
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,565
<i>So, Gob, I need you to help me</i>
<i>sneak her past the guards.</i>

221
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,432
Well, gee, I didn't think the woman I'd be
checking out at spring break would be Mom.

222
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,266
- She's better looking
than the whores you date.
- Don't call my escorts whores.

223
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,897
- Mom's still got it!
- I don't date whores!

224
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,466
Stop it! Stop it! This objectification
of women has to stop!

225
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,241
- It's just Mom and whores.
- No, how would you like it?

226
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,248
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

227
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,410
I should turn the tables on men
and see how they like being objectified.

228
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,422
- Men with low self-esteem. Get their clothes off.
- That is a great-

229
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,789
That is a great social statement.

230
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,955
<i>I shall get the video camera.</i>
<i>This is ripe for parody.</i>

231
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,329
This is ripe!

232
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,336
<i>Hejust wants to see</i>
<i>boys'Linuses. Oh, God.</i>

233
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,007
Here we go.

234
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,307
<i>And so Michael went back to see his mom.</i>

235
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,244
<i>L- I know that you're upset with me...</i>

236
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,943
<i>because I brought you here</i>
<i>under false pretenses...</i>

237
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,178
- <i>but I really was worried about you.</i>
- Oh, please.

238
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,278
I've been drinking
since before you were born.

239
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,358
So if alcohol is the reason I'm here,
I've got news for you, bub.

240
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,359
It's the only reason you're here too.

241
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,656
Hey, you're mean sober too.

242
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,061
<i>Uh, listen. I need your help.</i>

243
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,329
Kitty has shown up,
and she got ahold of Dad.

244
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,903
She found him in the attic?

245
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,964
They had a rerun of <i>Scandalmakers</i>
last night. Everybody figured it out.

246
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,066
She would like to meet you at a bar.

247
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,137
She says she's got some evidence that could
bring the business down if you don't go.

248
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,148
You're sending me into a bar?

249
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,378
Are you sure you can trust me
to make decisions for myself?

250
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,580
I just need you to find
out what she wants...

251
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,680
while I check all the local
motels for Dad.

252
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,850
<i>All right.</i>
<i>But here's what I want.</i>

253
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,928
A spa weekend with you.
A real one.

254
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,497
I want to spend
spring break with you.

255
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,860
You have high self-esteem, right?

256
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,869
Not after being in here.
It's a nightmare.

257
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,032
<i>Michael, Mom. We've gotta go now.</i>
<i>I created a diversion.</i>

258
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,905
You're gonna love this.

259
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,035
I'd like to check my uncle in
for rehab.

260
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,046
I thought we were
buying me some pants.

261
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,049
Oh, of course you think that.
You're high as a kite!

262
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,348
He needs help! Any-
He needs help! He needs help!

263
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,526
<i>And so Lucille was able</i>
<i>to meet with Kitty at Señor Tadpole's.</i>

264
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,892
I want what's due to me-
a Bluth son.

265
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,397
And I know
you have the material.

266
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,195
<i>Kitty was right. Ten years earlier...</i>

267
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,829
<i>George Sr. Was taking an</i>
<i>experimental hair growth drug.</i>

268
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,032
<i>Fearing damage to his fertility...</i>

269
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,974
<i>he froze a specimen</i>
<i>ofhis reproductive material...</i>

270
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,241
<i>in case he ever wanted</i>
<i>another child.</i>

271
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,407
<i>Soon, news came out that the drug...</i>

272
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,746
<i>although somewhat successful...</i>

273
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,980
<i>wreaked havoc</i>
<i>on the central nervous system.</i>

274
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,058
<i>So what do you need me for?</i>
<i>He's not taking the monkey drug anymore.</i>

275
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,154
- And you're the one who's got him. Not me.
- Oh, you know why.

276
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,394
He won't touch me. He said
he doesn't cheat on his wife anymore.

277
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,070
- He said that?
<i>- Drinking contest!</i>

278
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,334
- He said that?
<i>- Drinking contest!</i>

279
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,431
<i>Tell you what.</i>
<i>I'll drink you for it.</i>

280
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,807
Oh, I heard you don't handle
your booze so well anymore.

281
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,813
So this should be easy for you.

282
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,480
That one didn't count.

283
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,988
<i>And Michael met up with Gob</i>
<i>to try and find their father.</i>

284
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,251
I got it.
From the banana stand freezer.

285
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,260
The exact same kind of cooler
that's in the photo with Dad.

286
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,024
- What do we need another cooler for?
- Ah, poor Michael.

287
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,123
You do not think like a magician.

288
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,361
- Such a "How'd he do dat?"
- Uh-huh.

289
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,131
It's a classic bait and switch.
This is a decoy cooler.

290
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,470
We take it in, switch it with the one
from the photo and get out of there.

291
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,442
Kitty comes back. Everything's normal.
It's like we were never there.

292
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,481
- But Dad's gone.
- Long gone. But it buys us
all the time in the world.

293
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,676
I got it back, Mikey.
The self-confidence. I am a magician!

294
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,879
I'm saying, when Kitty comes back,
notices Dad's gone...

295
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,923
first thing she's gonna do is check
the cooler, see if the evidence is still there.

296
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,924
Buys us, like, one second.

297
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,960
- I am a worthless magician.
- Not true.

298
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,791
- I can't even do one simple trick.
- Come on.

299
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,024
- I'm covered in sweat. Look at me!
- It's a great trick.

300
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,727
- Would've been flawless
if you had a decoy Dad too.
- Damn it.

301
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:14,135
And I used a guy that looked
just like him in my last bait and switch.

302
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,903
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

303
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,172
- Well, I'm no longer needed here.
- No, no, no.

304
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,180
I think the cooler's
actually gonna help us.

305
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,477
The extra second that it buys us
could be the difference.

306
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,849
Great. Just give me a couple
of minutes to catch my breath.

307
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,392
<i>Lucille, minutes out of rehab...</i>

308
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,330
<i>was engaging in a drinking contest...</i>

309
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,697
<i>at the behest ofher son.</i>

310
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,100
. Let me know when you're ready, dear.
<i>- She's mixing!</i>

311
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,002
<i>While right outside the bar</i>-

312
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,337
I know what the shape
of a banana reminds you of...

313
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,706
and I know that when I say
"nuts," it makes you giggle.

314
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,712
But do you have any other response...

315
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,612
to "here's a banana with nuts"?

316
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,379
Why are we even going after
this idiot demographic?

317
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,653
Don't you get it? They're not even eating these.
They just like saying bananas and nuts.

318
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,695
And I won't- I won't tell you why.
That's your father's job.

319
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,356
<i>Come on! Let's see</i>
<i>some bananas and nuts!</i>

320
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,195
Oh, perhaps we should
just pull their pants off.

321
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,236
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? This is where we shoot.

322
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,966
Yeah, well, you've got competition now,
'cause we're making our own video.

323
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,372
Will you just get over it!
It's nudity.

324
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,036
Just because you're ashamed of your body
doesn't mean everybody should be.

325
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:31,310
Oh, really? Well, let's see how you feel
about what you're packing.

326
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,750
You're a- never-nude?

327
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,118
<i>You're asking girls to take their tops off,</i>
<i>and you can't even be naked?</i>

328
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:43,092
- I've gotta get this.
- Lindsay, I've already got it.

329
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,787
I'm back into cutoffs. Lindsay?

330
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,800
I didn't see you at the convention.

331
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,336
- No, I was in Germany. I teleconferenced in.
- Ohhh.

332
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,929
- Did you go to the seminar on chafing?
- Dr. Schoenweiss. Yes.

333
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,941
This is never gonna work. There's
too many people, too many rooms.

334
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,409
Michael, we can't give up.
This is important.

335
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,243
Believe me. I'd rather be down at the beach
having drinks, howling at chicks.

336
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,341
Dad?

337
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,690
Oh, my boys. Yes, you-
you came for me.

338
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,454
Yeah, hi, Dad. Uh, Gob's gonna get you
out of those handcuffs. Can you do it?

339
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,224
- One handcuff key coming up.
- Great.

340
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,602
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,933
Swallowed a key just in case
I ended up doing a show.

342
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,769
Come on. This is disgusting.

343
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,776
- I'm doing this for you.
- <i>This continued for some time...</i>

344
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,971
<i>while Michael switched out the coolers.</i>

345
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,446
- Why are you switching out the coolers?
- It buys us time, Dad.

346
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,676
- What? Like a second?
- <i>Don't worry about it, okay?</i>

347
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,618
When I get this evidence out of here,
I'm turning it right into the court.

348
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,952
Are you kidding? I don't care if the evidence
gets out there. It gets me off the hook.

349
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,549
- What are you saying? This exonerates you?
- <i>I told you before.</i>

350
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,324
I was a patsy. I was set up.
I am tired of looking guilty.

351
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,629
Well, that's- that's great.

352
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,965
Now who's a horrible magician?

353
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,975
That is a crown, you horse's ass.

354
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,739
- How does that make you feel?
- Awesome.

355
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:12,476
<i>And George Michael caught up</i>
<i>with Maeby, determined to save her self-esteem.</i>

356
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,417
Look, I don't want to ruin your fun,
but I hate to see guys treat you like this.

357
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,217
You're better than that.
To me, anyway. You're-

358
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,314
- Awesome?
- No, I was gonna say you're-

359
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,724
you're like this flower,
and I know it's springtime...

360
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,297
but I just- I'd hate
to see you get plucked...

361
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,060
by someone who doesn't even care
that you're blossoming.

362
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,160
That's what I've been waiting to hear.

363
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,998
<i>Maeby was referring to the dialogue...</i>

364
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:40,067
<i>but George Michael hadjust rediscovered</i>
<i>his feelings for his cousin.</i>

365
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,477
Hi, Ann. It's-It's George Michael Bluth.

366
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,778
Um, when you get back
into town, we should talk.

367
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,721
Can I get you
anything else, ma'am?

368
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,018
No, thanks.
I have to get back to rehab.

369
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,027
<i>She's in rehab!</i>

370
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,088
<i>And so George Sr. Was free...</i>

371
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,259
<i>and Michael and Gob</i>
<i>absconded with the evidence.</i>

372
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,269
One heck of a trick
you ended up pullin' in there, Gob.

373
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,396
Truthfully, that wasn't part of the act.

374
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,408
I was actually trying to get the key
to come out of my mouth.

375
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,947
That part was very surprising, but I'm talking
about how you helped me get Dad out of there.

376
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,608
Thanks to you, this family
could end up being okay.

377
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,244
<i>And Gob had finally</i>
<i>overcome his own low self-esteem.</i>

378
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,256
Hey, aren't you that magician
who always embarrasses himself?

379
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,794
Not anymore. Not anymore.

380
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,425
- Gob!
- <i>But he lost it...</i>

381
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,900
<i>along with the exonerating evidence.</i>

382
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,996
They're laughing, Michael. They're laughing.

383
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,235
<i>And that's how you narrate a story.</i>

384
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,575
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

385
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,739
<i>Lucille gets some</i>
<i>disturbing information.</i>

386
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,114
- Did you get the evidence?
- Yes, and then Gob ruined it.

387
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,246
After all the trouble we went through to
switch coolers with the one from the banana stand.

388
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,918
The one in the freezer? I was storing
very important things there.

389
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:06,487
<i>And Kitty finds</i>
<i>what she's been looking for.</i>

390
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:16,970
There was 250 c.c.'s of your
father in that banana stand!

391
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,043
No touching.

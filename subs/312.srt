1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,004
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,575
<i>Michael was preparing his sister...</i>

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,304
<i>for her upcoming deposition
in the case against their father.</i>

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:16,280
If they say, "Did you know of any
financial improprieties?” you’ll...

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,351
Unbutton my shirt a bit
and give 'em this look.

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,284
- Not really sure what you're goin' for.
- I drank a lot last night.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,692
- Why were you drinking? - If I look like
a man who made love to his wife last night...

8
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:32,390
- it's because I almost did.
- That's why.

9
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,525
<i>But Tobias had
a low tolerance for alcohol.</i>

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,570
Oh, you look very hands...

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,037
So you just finished off the bottle?

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,041
I had to. It's vodka.
It goes bad once it's opened.

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,543
I think that's another
one of Mom's little fibs.

14
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,375
You know, like,
"I'll sacrifice anything for my children."

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,008
Speaking of Mom, she really
doesn't want me to do this deposition.

16
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,586
You have to, Lindsay.
Sorry. You've been subpoenaed.

17
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,552
I'm afraid I might not be able
to be deposed either.

18
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,750
I got a call out of the blue for a chance
to play a very important part...

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,794
in... <i>The Prosecution.</i>

20
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,127
- The prosecution called you?
- I assume it's a CBS procedural.

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,259
They didn't send sides, so I thought I'd trot out
a <i>Vagina Monologue</i> or something else I know.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,429
They did ask for old photos
and documents...

23
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,905
so I went and got these
out of the secret room... Oop.

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,999
"The prosecution" is not a TV show.

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,079
It's clearly somebody in the D.A.'s office
trying to get you to flip.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,741
These guys will bend the law
to enforce the law.

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,977
Tell me that's not a CBS franchise.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,486
I'm serious. Why else would they
want all these documents?

29
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,488
For set dressing, silly.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,252
Those Hollywood shows
are so incredibly detailed.

31
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,089
You're gonna tell them you're not interested.
We all have to be careful.

32
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,426
The prosecution's gonna be
coming after all of us.

33
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,295
- Including me?
- You don't have any secrets.

34
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,302
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I...

35
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,429
Um, hey, uh, speaking of that.

36
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,439
It's actually her birthday soon...

37
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,441
so I thought we could all
do something for her.

38
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,842
- Whose birthday?
- Maeby's.

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,145
I was changing the subject. We... No.
Yeah, we weren't talking about Maeby.

40
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,118
But she's been feeling kind of
left out of the family lately...

41
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,781
and I thought maybe we could
throw her a surprise party.

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,188
Actually, he'd already told her about it.

43
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,055
I just poured Mom into bed.

44
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,187
- Would it kill her to let some vodka go bad?
- No. Vodka doesn't...

45
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,731
It's my birthday in a week,
and I bet you they don't even know.

46
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,893
They forget every year.
I should just move out.

47
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,733
But they're planning
a surprise party for you.

48
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,171
They wouldn't forget your 16th birthday.

49
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,971
Oh, my gosh.
Our little girl's turning 14.

50
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,844
- Sixteen actually.
- Well, I am off to buy the perfect present.

51
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,509
- Maybe she'd like a suit like this.
<i>- That</i> is <i>her suit.</i>

52
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,578
- They probably don't make it in a woman's style.
<i>- They</i> only <i>make it in a woman's.</i>

53
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,748
Well, I'm off, my love.

54
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,326
- You see? Sometimes, shame can be fun.
- Shame?

55
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,089
Secrets. You... You said "shame."

56
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,665
He said "shame."

57
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,734
How does he know about her?

58
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,531
Didn't he just say Gob
should be ashamed of himself?

59
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,232
No, but give it a while. Somebody will.
What's all that for?

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,901
- It's for my out-of-town act.
- Out of town, Gob?

61
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,538
- The prosecution is watching every move we make.
- I'm just going to Iraq.

62
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,616
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

63
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,776
No, you're not. Dad is up on treason charges
for building homes in Iraq.

64
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,013
- It's a USO tour.
- You're not going.

65
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,023
I'm doing my Christian magic act
my religion girlfriend helped me work out.

66
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,593
I dress up like Jesus, walk on water,
which you've seen.

67
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,889
- I'm gonna do the wine into water.
- It's water into wine.

68
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,658
Then I've just emptied out
all your wine bottles...

69
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,927
and filled them
with fake stuff for nothing.

70
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,196
Great. How am I supposed
to have sex with my husband now?

71
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,637
Gob. We got the depositions.
You're not goin' to Iraq.

72
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,537
You're just jealous
that I am the son...

73
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,237
that the father has asked
to do his work in the Holy Land.

74
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,077
- So Dad <i>is</i> behind this.
- And he won't bump me up to business class.

75
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:41,552
<i>Later that day,
Tobias met with the prosecutor, Wayne Jarvis.</i>

76
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:46,455
...a flower in my garden,
a mystery in my panties.

77
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,459
This is not an audition
for a CBS show.

78
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,463
- I was just looking for some feedback.
- It was a little contrived.

79
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,056
Now, we think we can
offer you a good deal...

80
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,331
if you provide evidence
that puts George Bluth behind bars.

81
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,896
I'll tell you what else is contrived...
the odds I would turn on my family...

82
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,067
for somebody who is not
only trying to hurt them...

83
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,146
but who wouldn't know good acting
if it marched through that door...

84
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,579
and gave them head shots
and decorative soaps.

85
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,242
<i>And as Tobias waited for the elevator...</i>

86
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,788
<i>he noticed an interesting flyer
promising the perfect gift...</i>

87
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,584
<i>for the daughter who didn't
feel part of the family.</i>

88
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,922
- He took the bait.
- He's a classic scrapbooker.

89
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,496
Right down to the woman's suit.

90
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,930
<i>Michael went to confront
his father about Gob's trip to Iraq.</i>

91
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,299
Everyone knows you built homes
for Saddam Hussein. Tell me what's going on.

92
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,066
For the millionth time,
I was a patsy.

93
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,266
I gotta find a loophole
to get out of this...

94
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,813
but Buster took coma
and your mother took rehab.

95
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,972
Hey. You goin' to rehab again?

96
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,313
I'm bringing Lindsay.
I'm worried about her.

97
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,250
Did you get the corkscrew?

98
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,515
I see there's gonna be wine
at the rehab, huh?

99
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,456
Wine only turns into alcohol
if you let it sit.

100
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,027
How do you come up with these?

101
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,290
I'll meet with the prosecutor,
ask for a postponement.

102
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,299
But I'm gonna have to go on the record
about why you two aren't there.

103
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,335
If you make a liar out of me,
we're gonna be in big trouble.

104
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:07,497
- This constant bickering is gonna
put me in a coma. - Nice try, Dad.

105
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,906
<i>Buster was finding his fake coma hard to sustain.</i>

106
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,309
It takes a lot of courage
to endure what they put you through...

107
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,247
especially since your mother
saw that Web site.

108
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,648
<i>Buster was not only providing
medical students...</i>

109
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,481
<i>a live body to learn</i> on...

110
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,249
That's okay. Try again.
No. That's a tendon.

111
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,918
He'd be screaming right now.
That's okay. Try again.

112
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,929
<i>He'd also served as a human canvas
for aspiring beauticians.</i>

113
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,592
That's okay. You put too much collagen
in there. No, no. Try it again.

114
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,160
<i>And a much-needed set of teeth
for a dental program...</i>

115
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,240
<i>Designed to encourage at-risk youth.</i>

116
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,572
That's okay, Turf.
No. Try again.

117
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,272
You've got your forearm
on this windpipe, Dog Bone.

118
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,509
<i>- It really was amazing for their self-esteem.</i>
- I did it.

119
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,381
<i>Even Buster was moved.</i>

120
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,012
<i>But he endured it all for Adelaide.</i>

121
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,023
I love you, Buster.

122
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,026
What I would give to hear you say
you love me too...

123
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,097
even if it meant you'd been
faking this whole time.

124
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,395
Speak to me.
Say anything, my love.

125
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,765
Anything?

126
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,599
Faker!

127
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,402
I wasn't faking my love for you.
I didn't want to testify at my dad's trial.

128
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,943
- Well, you're a coward.
- No!

129
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,275
Adelaide, how could you
let this happen again?

130
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,817
I wish you'd come to,
or don't you care about me?

131
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,409
- Of course I care about you.
- You faker!

132
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,989
How could I let this
happen to me again?

133
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,082
Take a single step
to show me your love, Gary.

134
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,995
Aw! Faker!

135
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,996
<i>She was wrong on that one.</i>

136
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,066
<i>It was love
that made Gary take that step.</i>

137
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,227
Who ever said vegetables
were good for your heart?

138
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,999
No, no. No, please.

139
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,735
<i>Of course, he hadn't used his legs in three weeks.</i>

140
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,743
<i>And Michael met with Wayne Jarvis.</i>

141
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,245
I apologize for the rest of my family
not being here.

142
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,579
They wanted to testify,
but they all have perfectly legal excuses.

143
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,619
And I can assure you
that no one is hiding.

144
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,781
Michael, your mother and your sister
are not in a rehab center.

145
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,756
- Where are they really?
- We don't know.

146
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,259
But we do know the two people
who checked into Shady Pines...

147
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,594
under the names Lucille Bluth
and Lindsay Fünke are not your relatives.

148
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,428
Also, for someone in a coma...

149
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:19,631
your brother Buster has made an impressive
15 phone calls to radio stations...

150
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,799
alternately requesting "I Will Survive” and...
What was the other one?

151
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,878
- "She's Out of My Life."
- "She's Out of My Life."

152
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,412
As for your brother Gob
in the USO...

153
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,846
- Don't tell me he's not in Iraq?
- No, he's there.

154
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,885
In fact, Michael,
he's on the news... right now.

155
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,880
Are bees better
at sniffing out drugs than dogs?

156
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,425
I'm sure it's coming right up.
They've been playing it all day.

157
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,155
<i>And they deliver
insulin right to my door.</i>

158
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,026
I'm sure it's right after
this series of ads.

159
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,828
It's, like, every time
you turn on the TV, it's there.

160
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,597
- Why don't we just go online?
- Cool your Japanese jets.

161
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,639
<i>- An insurgent in Iraq from
Orange County, California?</i> - It's on.

162
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,074
<i>Why he's being held in jail and why
he won't be coming home anytime soon.</i>

163
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,137
And imagine the impact if that had come on
right when we turned on the TV.

164
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,955
<i>Michael had been called
to sign his brother out of the hospital.</i>

165
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,960
You can stop pretending to be in a coma.
We heard your requests on the way over.

166
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,327
I'm not faking it, Michael.
I really am this expressionless.

167
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,332
My love thinks I'm a coward...

168
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:25,302
just because I was using precious
hospital resources to avoid my legal obligation.

169
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,066
That does say coward.
We've got bigger problems.

170
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,506
- Gob is locked in a prison in Iraq.
- What?

171
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,636
- So he's actually in an Iraqi prison?
- No. It's US run.

172
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,976
- Oh.
- God knows what they're doing to him.

173
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,107
Mom and Lindsay
are pretending to be in rehab.

174
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:43,052
I can't get ahold of Dad, and I have
to fly to Iraq myself to get Gob.

175
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,851
- Do you have to go by yourself?
- Let me go with you.

176
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,724
I was trained by army.
I speak the language.

177
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,922
You speak Arabic?

178
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,329
- What's that mean?
- I was just clearing my throat.

179
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,594
But I think it actually
does mean "laundry."

180
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,262
Like a child's laundry.
We don't really have a word for it.

181
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,569
But this is exactly what I need
to prove to my love...

182
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,041
that I am a hero,
not a coward.

183
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,442
I have my uniform here.
Mother brought it for the photo shoot.

184
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,680
Would you be back in time
for Maeby's surprise party?

185
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,184
Probably not.
We'll do something when I get back.

186
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,279
Why don't you drive the stair car home.
Buster and I will leave from here.

187
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,848
- Be careful.
- Hey. Who's tougher than us?

188
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,697
Close one.

189
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,496
<i>The depositions had been delayed...</i>

190
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,596
<i>but the prosecution was about to get
a Lord & Taylor bag full of evidence.</i>

191
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,301
We supply the glitter,
the glue, the crepe paper...

192
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,744
and the ready-made template pages
for you to decorate and fill out with...

193
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:46,216
My Favorite Birthday,
Foreign Bank Statements...

194
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,379
and, of course... shh...
Family Secrets.

195
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,218
<i>The scrapbooking sting
had helped the DA gather evidence...</i>

196
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,522
<i>against people as diverse
as Ken Lay...</i>

197
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,297
<i>Oliver North...</i>

198
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,392
<i>but, ironically, not Martha Stewart.</i>

199
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,335
So dig up whatever you can,
and remember...

200
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,306
photocopies are not
admissible as memories.

201
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,969
Sir, I'm gonna have to go to
our old family storage unit in Reseda.

202
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,105
No problem. We can arrange for a helicopter
to take you there right now.

203
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,345
Wow! This is the best free
scrapbooking class I've ever taken.

204
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>Meanwhile,
Lindsay and Lucille were at a spa in the desert...</i>

205
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,482
<i>avoiding both rehab
and their depositions.</i>

206
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,993
Four saunas, three steam baths,
Olympic-sized pool...

207
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,690
and you're telling me
there's no alcohol?

208
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,699
What the hell are we
supposed to do for two days?

209
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,133
I could take the top off this grape juice,
and maybe by morning...

210
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:42,970
- Oh, for God's sake, Lindsay! Grow up!
You're 40 years old. - Thirty-five.

211
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,339
Well, maybe this will be nice. Hmm?

212
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,777
We can talk and...
connect a little.

213
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,147
- I must have a Xanax.
- I'll go score some weed from the staff.

214
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,814
<i>And Michael and Buster
checked out of the hospital.</i>

215
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,914
I can't believe they wouldn't
give me a wheelchair ride.

216
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,223
You're gonna be sitting on a plane
for 18 hours to Iraq.

217
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,297
Yeah, I should definitely
get one for the airport.

218
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,298
You're going to Iraq?

219
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,561
Yes. I'm going to save my brother.

220
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,899
So you are brave after all.

221
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:17,465
Fighting for your brother. Oh, Buster,
you're such a!@%$#.

222
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,976
- That means she likes you.
- It's more than "like."

223
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,377
I'd give anything
to have you stay here.

224
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,711
Then I will stay here.
I was scared to go anyway.

225
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,512
- Faker!
- Oh!

226
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,248
- I knew you were no good.
- Than I shall go... to forget you.

227
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,814
- Oh, Buster, don't go.
- I don't wanna go.

228
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,487
I'm gonna save everybody a lot of trouble
and say that we are going. Come on.

229
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,589
When I miss your lips, I'll put a fig
in my mouth and think of you.

230
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,069
- They have figs over there, right?
- I'll wait for you.

231
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,869
- What's this?
- Cab driver said he went into a coma...

232
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,341
as soon as they
pulled up to the hospital.

233
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,709
What a brave man.

234
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,577
<i>And soon the Bluth boys...</i>

235
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,344
<i>found themselves in a strange land.</i>

236
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,019
What did he say?
Where are we?

237
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,958
He said he was taking
surface streets to LAX.

238
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,030
The freeway's backed up all the way
to Knott's Berry Farm.

239
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,362
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
got ahold of Maeby's address book...</i>

240
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,029
<i>to invite all her friends
to her sweet 16.</i>

241
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,539
<i>He did, however, decide against
some guests he found threatening.</i>

242
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,836
I don't think Steve Holt
has to come to this.

243
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,708
<i>And yet he did invite Mickey Rourke.</i>

244
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,805
<i>And the guys finally did get to Iraq...</i>

245
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,884
<i>but Buster's Arabic
was a little rusty.</i>

246
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:37,752
<i>And instead of a cab, he hired them
the only rickshaw in Baghdad.</i>

247
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,950
Are you ready
for Operation Hot Brother?

248
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,959
I'm not ready to call it that.

249
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,622
<i>They arrived at the prison the Americans
were training Iraqis to run.</i>

250
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,722
No. What'd you forget?

251
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,893
Walk them through the...
The what?

252
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,767
- The metal detector.
- That's okay. Try again.

253
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,397
<i>My God! You came!</i>

254
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,999
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, I missed you, Michael!

255
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,568
- All right.
- Or should I say "robot"?

256
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,241
- What, 'cause I'm not crying? - Maybe you
don't have enough RAM to understand this...

257
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,286
but there's such a thing
as brotherly love.

258
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,116
What's he doing here?
I thought he was in a coma.

259
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,247
I was trying to prove
to this nurse that I'm brave.

260
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,918
I need to get a picture of me with the insurgent.
I can send it on my phone.

261
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,257
Why were you arrested
by the Americans?

262
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,526
I was doing a little off-mission street magic,
trying to make a few dinars.

263
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,501
<i>And that is why Jesus
was often referred to as...</i>

264
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,437
"the king... of kings."

265
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,442
Queens. The king of queens.

266
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,344
Now I would like you to behold
one of the late, great Jesus's biggest illusions...

267
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,880
The burning bush!

268
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,041
Bush? Burn Bush?

269
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,812
- Burn Bush!
- Burning Bush!

270
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,615
Burn Bush!

271
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,552
<i>The security forces arrived to suppress...</i>

272
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,286
<i>what appeared to be
an anti-American demonstration.</i>

273
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:55,499
That's okay. Use your foot. The thigh bruises.
What doesn't? Try again.

274
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,297
So you weren't doing
anything for Dad?

275
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,134
He had said, if I happened to be
in the neighborhood of Sadr City and Mamoon...

276
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,140
would I mind torching
a couple model homes?

277
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,803
Dad's just trying to keep information
out of the hands of the Iraqis.

278
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,006
I have a feeling he was trying to keep information
out of the hands of the federal marshals.

279
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,242
I'm gonna go collect my things
and say my good-byes.

280
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,013
- You guys check me outta here.
- You're an enemy combatant.

281
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,180
It's not gonna be that easy.
I'll talk to them...

282
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,485
but you might wanna prepare
for a long stay.

283
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,560
Oh, shoot. I forgot
to say good-bye to Yusef.

284
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,104
That was a lot easier than I expected.
Almost too easy.

285
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,173
Why aren't we going to the airport?

286
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,107
I wanna check out this house Dad
asked you to burn down, see what he's hiding.

287
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,112
I think that's it, sir.

288
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,615
- Buster, this guy speaks English.
- No. I swallowed a moth.

289
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,618
I'm sorry it took so long...

290
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,350
but the Cheney Expressway was backed up
all the way to Halliburton Drive.

291
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,756
Let's see what all the mystery's about.

292
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,350
<i>That's when Michael found someone...</i>

293
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,693
<i>the U.S. Government</i>
had <i>been able to depose.</i>

294
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,063
- Hello?
- Take my picture!

295
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,898
Take my picture!

296
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,868
<i>Michael was in Iraq
when he came across a familiar face.</i>

297
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,142
- Are you, uh...
- I am Saddam Hussein...

298
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,308
look-alike.

299
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,579
- Who are you?
- I'm Michael Bluth.

300
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,121
These are my brothers
Buster and Gob Bluth.

301
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,624
Bluth? Is he here to fix
the air conditioning?

302
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:32,322
- Are you both Saddam Hussein look-alikes?
- Hardly. Invite them in.

303
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,491
I am behaving
like an Uday look-alike.

304
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,001
Come on in.
Come on in, guys.

305
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,594
I'd always heard that there
were Saddam Hussein look-alikes.

306
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,665
I'm just a little surprised to see you all
living here in... in one house...

307
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,745
that looks so similar to ours.

308
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,678
- Scar on that one dude's forehead's
gotta be a problem. - That's Achmed.

309
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,719
Never stop watching the trial.
We are all following it pretty closely.

310
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,152
They put this guy away,
you guys are out of a job, huh?

311
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,123
Yes. We wanted to keep the house
for just one more season.

312
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,662
- I have a baby on the way.
- I do a better Saddam than this guy.

313
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,664
- My Saddam would show his teeth.
- Yes, to chew the scenery.

314
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,599
<i>So Michael decided the least he could do...</i>

315
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,603
<i>was take a look
at the air conditioning.</i>

316
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,605
<i>But before he did,
he decided to see...</i>

317
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,666
<i>if there was a secret room
in this model home as well.</i>

318
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,941
<i>And that's when Michael
discovered the bombshell.</i>

319
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,845
Buster.

320
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,975
<i>Back at the American model home...</i>

321
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,850
<i>none of the invitees
had shown up for Maeby's party.</i>

322
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,220
- Surprise.
- That's what I figured.

323
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,385
So, did you send one of these
to everyone in my address book?

324
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,463
Yeah. I'm really sorry
they didn't come.

325
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,692
- I don't know what happened.
- I do. They found out I was 16.

326
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,735
<i>And a lot of us just didn't
want to drive down to Orange County.</i>

327
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,772
- What are you talking about?
- This cost me my job, George Michael.

328
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,104
I was a studio executive.
I made movies.

329
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,111
- Is that why you've been so stressed out
all the time? - Have I been?

330
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,114
You know what? I'm a kid.
I'm gonna start acting like one.

331
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,117
- What, you're gonna drink?
- Do you wanna join me?

332
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,278
I guess if you can run a studio...

333
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,755
<i>But they didn't know
it was the fake wine from Gob's magic show.</i>

334
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,758
- It's good.
<i>- And back in Iraq.</i>

335
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,058
- What is this?
- Looks like a mid-range nuclear warhead.

336
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,429
It has a range capacity
of 4,000 to 5,000 nautical miles.

337
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,934
You've got a pretty sophisticated
knowledge of this technology.

338
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,528
My God. It makes me wanna
have an ice cream cone.

339
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,574
- Doesn't this make you wanna
have an ice cream cone? - It does.

340
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,405
You'll have plenty of time
for ice cream in prison.

341
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,503
Ice cream sandwiches.

342
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,014
- CIA, undercover.
- CIA. Of course.

343
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,846
This explains why it was so easy
to get you out of prison.

344
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,920
I knew that, if he got out,
he would lead us...

345
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,989
right to whatever
your dad was hidin'.

346
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,082
<i>They'd even
created opportunities for this to happen.</i>

347
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,661
- Get in the cell, stupid.
- You're... You're...

348
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,926
You're the one who didn't
even shut the door. Come on!

349
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,593
Yeah. You guys can run
this place without us.

350
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:55,503
As... As soon as you stop
dropping your keys! Come on!

351
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,701
<i>They'd even staged something
called an "honor marathon"...</i>

352
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,440
<i>- they thought he was sure to take advantage of.</i>
- Come on.

353
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,982
<i>We've been lookin' for WMD's for years.</i>

354
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:10,522
WMD's? This thing is as fake
as Achmed's mustache. See?

355
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,817
Yeah, look. It's a HomeFill.

356
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,019
It's the company that makes the fake stuff
we fill the model homes with.

357
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,824
- What the hell?
- What is that, a recording device?

358
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,627
This is our stuff.
I gotta call this in.

359
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,667
Buster? Please?

360
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,464
Baker.

361
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,665
It doesn't sound like CIA East.
I'll check with CIA West.

362
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,072
Did we bug a house in Mamoon?

363
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,245
Yeah. We got some guy
named George Bluth...

364
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,541
to build houses there
so we could wire them.

365
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,711
Oh, look. I'm Uncle Buster.

366
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,810
I'm sorry no one
from the family came.

367
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,219
Sometimes I wish I wasn't
even part of the family.

368
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,518
- No, don't...
- Yes.

369
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,992
I've never wanted
to say this, but...

370
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,086
you might not even
be related to us.

371
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,324
- No?
- 'Cause Gangy once said to me...

372
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,231
your mom might not have
ever even been pregnant with you.

373
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,804
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

374
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,032
No. I'm, uh... I wouldn't.

375
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,575
Everyone still loves you.

376
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,770
Some more than others.

377
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,610
<i>And perhaps it was the fake wine...</i>

378
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,844
<i>but that was the night George Michael
and Maeby went to second base.</i>

379
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,013
So my dad <i>was</i> a patsy?

380
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,252
We call them "unintentional
operations victims," but yes.

381
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,194
We ran the whole operation
through a British building company.

382
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,855
They contacted my dad
for the plans.

383
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,195
I can't believe it.
After all of that, he wasn't lying.

384
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,237
Look, we feel terrible.
Because this is really our mistake.

385
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,239
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take you guys out.

386
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,468
- Take us out?
- What?

387
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,067
I could really go
for some Italian.

388
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,874
There is an Olive Garden
in Mamoon.

389
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,744
I think he means
to shoot you in the head.

390
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,648
But please, at least let him
look at the air conditioning.

391
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,517
If you're worried about us talking,
we will not say a word.

392
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,955
Don't be mad, but I have been sending
the pictures from my cell phone to my friend.

393
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,050
- Not now, Buster.
- He does not know what he's saying.

394
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,789
- You have?
- Uh...

395
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,458
Well, who knows
who <i>she</i> sent them to?

396
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,399
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
- Hmm?

397
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,910
- Looks like you are a hero, Buster.
- We both are.

398
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,502
- Well...
- Okay. Looks like you got us.

399
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,775
What can the US government
do for you?

400
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,183
We're gonna need some business class
tickets home... and direct flights.

401
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,085
None of this
stopping in Phoenix!@%$-!@%$.

402
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,181
And more importantly,
maybe we can drop...

403
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,260
some of these treason charges
against my father.

404
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,320
And I do believe there was
some mention of some ice cream.

405
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,993
<i>And so, with Operation Hot Brother a success...</i>

406
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,696
<i>our American heroes left Iraq.</i>

407
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,933
Take Condoleezza Rice Lane. It's quicker.

408
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,771
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

409
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,505
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

410
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,710
<i>Tobias gives his daughter the gift
he'd stayed up all night making.</i>

411
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,309
And here's a picture
of your mother pregnant.

412
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,287
And here's a whole series
of your head starting to crown.

413
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,791
Look at you...
so full of wonder and shock.

414
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,418
You still do it.
And so does he!

415
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,726
Boy, you guys really are related.

416
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,393
<i>And Michael and Gob
make an interesting discovery.</i>

417
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,027
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy.

418
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,606
The real Saddam
has a scar on his head.

419
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,801
- I'm no scar. I'm no scar.
- Oh, my God.

420
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,537
Dot com.

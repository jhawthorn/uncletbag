1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,897
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,633
<i>Michael Bluth believed
he’d just made a shocking discovery.</i>

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,211
That might be an older sister
that we've never met.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,042
Wow. Look at the beak
on that bird.

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,912
<i>Michael found the picture
in a secret room...</i>

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,452
<i>while looking for incriminating
evidence against his father.</i>

7
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,384
I have an older sister?

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,253
<i>- Don't you kind of remember having
an older sister?</i> - Not at all.

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,293
- What, do you?
- A little bit. I mean, "Nellie" does sound familiar.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,523
- Mom and Dad clearly were trying to keep this
hidden from us. - But this could be anybody.

11
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,531
This could be a deformed neighbor or...

12
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,864
A child that Mom and Dad
gave up for some reason...

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,734
and whose identity they're now using
to pin their crimes on.

14
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,933
The prosecutor said that there was that account
with money in it labeled "N. Bluth."

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,874
Her name is Nellie.

16
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,778
Do you remember when you thought
there was a mysterious Mr. "F" out to get you?

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,283
Yeah, but that was retard... misguided.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,253
This is different. This is N. Bluth.

19
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,416
Well, why don't you just go to Dad
and ask who Nellie is, point blank?

20
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,426
So he can just cover it up and lie?

21
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,962
I can't stand to hear one more lie
out of this family.

22
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,965
Ah, there's the woman
I'm sexually attracted to.

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,967
Okay. But that's the last one.

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,766
- Well, I'm off to the gym to prepare for our tryst.
- Tryst?

25
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,171
Yes, Lindsay and I are planning a night
of heterosexual intercourse.

26
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,177
- You can just say intercourse.
- We talked about it last night.

27
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,009
<i>After a disappointing
attempt at lovemaking.</i>

28
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,141
Ah, this isn't going to happen.
I just want you to be satisfied.

29
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,344
Oh, T., you're always thinking of others.

30
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,479
I tried that. It didn't work either.

31
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:34,026
You know, maybe I would be more attracted
to you if you were in better shape.

32
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,925
You know, if you were just
more muscular, masculine.

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,362
- Does that make me shallow?
- No.

34
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,764
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

35
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,200
Maybe we should take a little time
to work on ourselves...

36
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,671
and then we'll plan a special night
in seven or eight days.

37
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,038
- Or a couple of weeks.
- Let's say three weeks.

38
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,475
- We're gonna go for it in a month.
- At the start of next month.

39
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,479
And we're gonna call it
a 31-day month.

40
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,845
Even though
this particular month has 30 days.

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh, you know, I've already
prepared a list of "won'ts."

42
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,687
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
My list of "can'ts."

43
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,349
Marital love can be so romantic.

44
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,449
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What?

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,553
"Marital love." You were looking right at me,
and you said "marital love." Why would I...

46
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,996
<i>George Michael
was interested because earlier that day...</i>

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,400
<i>he discovered that the recent mock wedding
he'd acted in with his cousin Maeby...</i>

48
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,406
- We're married?
<i>- was, in fact, as real and binding...</i>

49
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,376
<i>as the rice pudding the disoriented
patients had thrown at them.</i>

50
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,242
- I was talking to your aunt and uncle.
- Of course.

51
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,078
They're married too... Each other.

52
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,813
Oh, please. Pity the fool who gives me
a bunch of jibber-jabber about romance.

53
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,220
My religious girlfriend just dumped me,
and for a simple little misunderstanding.

54
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,488
If someone was always asking you to embrace
the Holy Trinity, what would you think they meant?

55
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,756
<i>Gob thought it meant a three-way.</i>

56
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,664
What? I thought that's what
all you guys lived for.

57
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,668
What about you? You game?

58
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,466
- Well, maybe she just wasn't for you.
- Which one?

59
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,598
I really wasn't paying attention.

60
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,337
The real problem is she keeps saying
that God is gonna show me a sign.

61
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,506
The... something of my ways.
"Wisdom"?

62
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,244
It's probably "wisdom."
Gob, listen, can I ask you a question?

63
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,651
- Do you remember growing up with a sister?
- Sister.

64
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,554
Uh, no, I don't.

65
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,025
Not really ringin' any bells.

66
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,120
- Other than Lindsay, of course.
- Oh, Lindsay!

67
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,392
Well, you might not be
the most reputable source on this.

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
<i>- Upstairs...</i>
- What?

69
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,698
<i>- George Michael was sharing his news
with his cousin.</i> - You mean we're married?

70
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,138
- It's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything.
- We should shred it.

71
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,437
- It's creeping me out.
- Yeah, me... It's...

72
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,809
But if we just put it over the dresser,
like we think it's a joke...

73
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,144
- then we would always know...
- It is a joke.

74
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,616
Unless we get it framed.

75
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,177
<i>And Michael
went to investigate his mystery sister.</i>

76
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,918
- Michael! What a surprise.
- Really? Were you expecting somebody else?

77
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,824
Maybe, uh, one of
your <i>two</i> daughters?

78
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,727
Oh, Lindsay and Tobias never visit.

79
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,392
We're so bad!

80
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,061
I-I actually meant Lindsay and Nellie.

81
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,605
You call him that too?

82
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,473
- Oh, it's so nice to be able to talk like this.
- Where's Dad?

83
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,239
- What's all this?
- Computer stuff from the office.

84
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,511
Pop, you're not doin' another one
of those Black Fridays? Your mass firings?

85
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,143
<i>Before firing his employees, however...</i>

86
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,485
<i>George Sr. had been sure
to clear the office of its valuables.</i>

87
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,683
So, when do we get to see
our new, fancy offices?

88
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,091
Soon as you get your new, fancy jobs.
You're all fired.

89
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,323
<i>The employees never saw it coming...</i>

90
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:30,767
<i>even though their first task was often
to unload computers from a rental truck.</i>

91
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,839
No, it's not a Black Friday,
although I did enjoy those.

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,376
No, the prosecution's gonna want
to have access to the hard drive...

93
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,106
so I just want to make sure
everything's nice and clean for them.

94
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,182
- What the hell is that thing?
- An electromagnet.

95
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,114
Think of it as a giant delete key.

96
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,186
Well, I hate to spoil your fun, Dad...

97
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,882
but I got backups on all of that stuff,
and this is illegal.

98
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,322
Oh! Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold...

99
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,122
but I am trying to protect my family.

100
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,227
That's not a real gold necklace, is it?

101
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,234
Well, it wasn't really
your 50th birthday.

102
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,827
You know, Dad, you can't have
this stuff in here, all right?

103
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,838
And we don't need more trouble.

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,535
It's bad enough you got Buster faking a coma
just so he doesn't have to testify.

105
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,908
I've been trying to get him
out of that coma.

106
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,709
It's costing us a fortune.
He's sleeping us dry.

107
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,809
Okay, faker, I'm cutting the cord.

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,084
I'll see ya at the snack machine.

109
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,853
If he knows that you don't want him
in the coma, then why's he still in it?

110
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,360
For some reason, he won't tell me.

111
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,728
<i>- He'd fallen for his day nurse.</i>
- Buster, you're so dear.

112
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,667
<i>She'd found his complete lack of
personality and movement enchanting.</i>

113
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,103
I wish you could say something.

114
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:45,109
Course, if you did, everything would
be ruined 'cause you wouldn't be as pure.

115
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,739
Speaking of living a lie, I don't suppose either
of you have remembered who this N. Bluth is.

116
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,374
Not a Nick or a Nellie?

117
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,012
Just the one who married Lindsay.

118
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,420
Oh, isn't it fun to talk like this?

119
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,360
<i>So Michael returned to the office,
where the atmosphere was paranoid.</i>

120
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,065
- Is it Black Friday?
- No one's getting fired. No one's getting fired.

121
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,067
But we haven't been paid,
and they took our computers.

122
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,264
This looks bad, but it's just my father trying
to erase the hard drives to avoid conviction.

123
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,841
The company is fine.
This is... This is fun though, isn't it?

124
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,910
They brought out all the old machines.

125
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,446
They've seen better days,
but I'm sure they're all functional, right?

126
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,209
- Like Tom here.
- I'm 30.

127
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,376
You're kidding me.

128
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,751
<i>But Michael found
the equipment frustrating as well.</i>

129
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:34,054
"Gob's Program"? Idiot.

130
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,685
<i>And then he noticed something else.</i>

131
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,497
- Nellie.
- Michael, I gotta talk to...

132
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,331
Oh, wow. K-Y pro, huh?

133
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,462
Hey, don't get any moisture
on these babes.

134
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,506
Hey! Tobias.

135
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,576
Buddy, I needed that information.

136
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,735
This is that sister I've been lookin' for.

137
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,178
Just hit "print screen." I'm sure
that whatever's on there will come up.

138
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,682
Oh, look at that.

139
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,584
I kind of remember these
being faster, you know?

140
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,749
Well, we were probably all so jacked up
on amyl and disco music we didn't notice.

141
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,759
But I'm glad about this printer lag...

142
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,955
because I was hoping
to have a jaw session with you.

143
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,532
Why don't we just say
as long as that means a talk?

144
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:19,128
I find myself attracted
to someone who's not my wife.

145
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,605
- What's her name?
- Michael.

146
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,871
- Can you believe it?
- You're married to my sister.

147
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,878
Don't you think I know that?

148
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,778
- I-I'm not interested in you that way.
- What way?

149
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,817
- Pick one.
- No.

150
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,888
Did you think you were the Michael
I was talking about? No.

151
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,219
- What? - No, interesting that
your mind went there though.

152
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:44,285
Okay. Uh, no. I'm afraid the Michael
I'm talking about is all lady.

153
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,127
- She's the trainer at my gym.
- The trainer you started with today?

154
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,566
- Indeed. Can you believe she's a bodybuilder?
- Indeed.

155
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,002
What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

156
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,006
- What am I doing? - You're nervous about
becoming intimate with Lindsay again.

157
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,508
- I guess.
- You probably should not rush into things.

158
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,580
Don't call this girl-Michael.
Stay away from the gym.

159
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,377
- Just leave it alone.
- Wise words, boy-Michael.

160
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,647
I'll tell you, if I wasn't so dripping
and disgustingly sweaty right now...

161
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,916
I'd hop over this desk
and give you such a hug.

162
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,548
- Hey, coulda, shoulda, woulda.
- Hey, hey. No, no.

163
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,628
Ooh, look. Number's up.
Look at that.

164
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,924
Ah, it would've been a seven.

165
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,159
<i>Later that night,
Lucille visited Buster in the hospital.</i>

166
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:26,227
- What the hell is this?
- My name is Representative John Van Heusen.

167
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,604
I am here to protect
the dignity of this boy's life.

168
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,768
Dignity? Easy for you to say.

169
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,005
I'm the one who has to
loofah his stump.

170
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,378
I believe death is wrong in all of its forms,
except lethal injection.

171
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,043
But that's just as a deterrent
against more death.

172
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,383
And this young man is enjoying life.

173
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,753
Hey! Hey! Huh? Hey, look at us, huh?

174
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,849
We're havin' a blast here, huh?

175
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,451
How the hell did you even find out
about Sleeping Beauty here?

176
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,532
It was an anonymous tip from someone
who cares about Buster's life.

177
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,726
It's not ringing any bells.

178
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,598
<i>In fact, it was Buster himself.</i>

179
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,433
They're trying to kill Baby Buster.

180
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,633
Oh, that's right... from the videos.

181
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,870
Well, no one's killin'
Baby Buster on my watch.

182
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,311
That is unless, of course, it's as a penalty
in a three-strikes scenario.

183
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,408
No one's called him Baby Buster
since high school.

184
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,646
<i>Michael, meanwhile...</i>

185
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,213
<i>had called one number after another
until he found Frank...</i>

186
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,294
<i>- a colleague of the woman he knew as Nellie.</i>
- I'm looking for Nellie.

187
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,455
<i>Yeah. Well, she's workin'
a software convention at some hotel.</i>

188
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,625
<i>- I can set up a meeting at the bar, man.</i>
- Appreciate it.

189
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,032
<i>So Michael arrived at the bar...</i>

190
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,937
<i>hoping to spot someone
who could be his sister.</i>

191
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,242
She grew into the nose.
Nellie? Hey! Hi.

192
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,246
Michael. Frank sent me.

193
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,340
- I think I might be interested in your services.
- You won't be sorry.

194
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,079
Yeah? I was hoping that maybe we
could just talk a little bit first, huh?

195
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,020
- Yeah, most people want to.
<i>- They did talk.</i>

196
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:55,253
<i>And Michael felt a connection
like he'd never felt with anyone in his family.</i>

197
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,795
I had a locker on the first floor
freshman year...

198
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,264
right next to the caf with all the junior lockers,
so it was clearly a mistake.

199
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,632
- But I didn't say anything, right?
- Ooh, you're bad.

200
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,932
I had that same locker
all throughout sophomore year.

201
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,270
- Junior year they had me on the third
floor with all the frosh. - That is wild.

202
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,368
I had the same combo throughout 'cause I
transferred the lock. Let me tell you why.

203
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,676
<i>Hey, let's see what
some of the other folks are up to.</i>

204
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,052
<i>Nothing there.</i>

205
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>Or there.</i>

206
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,789
<i>Oh, my.</i>

207
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,292
<i>Let's get back to Michael.</i>

208
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,125
It was Joe Namath's number,
Babe Ruth's number, then my birthday.

209
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,461
That is a great story.

210
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,626
<i>It wasn't a great story.</i>

211
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,069
<i>Nellie was just a great listener.
Most prostitutes are.</i>

212
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,003
Nellie, the hell with formalities.

213
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,474
- I think you and I should do business together.
- Me too.

214
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,414
<i>Michael had just hired a woman
he'd secretly believed to be his sister.</i>

215
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,649
How did you get into this line of work?

216
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,989
<i>But, of course, he'd also yet
to figure out she was a prostitute.</i>

217
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,655
I was buried in loan debt from business school,
so I started whoring myself out.

218
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,665
<i>Not that there weren't clues.</i>

219
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,066
What do you say we go up to my room
and seal the deal?

220
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,003
You're stayin' here, huh? I was actually
hoping to get into your business tomorrow.

221
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,836
It would give you a chance
to meet everybody in the office.

222
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,035
'Cause you're gonna be working
for the whole staff.

223
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,942
- You're gonna be filling three openings.
- Oh!

224
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,505
I heard there were a couple of girls like me
consulting over at Enron.

225
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,348
<i>So the next day, Michael
introduced his new consultant to his staff...</i>

226
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,354
<i>who weren't that pleased to meet her.</i>

227
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,857
You hired someone else?
We haven't even been paid yet.

228
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,359
That's exactly why I hired her...
to help out with the finances.

229
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,023
She's absolutely amazing at that stuff.
Right? You do do finances and stuff, right?

230
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,590
- I do all sorts of scenes.
- There you go. Okay, guys.

231
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,069
Don't be afraid to put her
in any position that you want, okay?

232
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,573
Dave, you give her access
to everything, okay?

233
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,473
I want you guys to think
of her as Nellie Bluth, all right?

234
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,877
In fact, we should probably get an I.D.
With that printed on it, okay?

235
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,415
<i>But she did have a list of "won'ts."</i>

236
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,044
We're gonna have some ground rules
first, okay? No!@%$#

237
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,384
!@%$ing or!@%ting.

238
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,982
<i>And no!@%$#% unless
you're wearing a!@%$#.</i>

239
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,062
Or you!@%$#% before you!@%$ me.

240
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:14,496
And if this winds up on the Web,
I will!@%$ you in the!@%.

241
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,398
Our computers don't even work on the Internet.

242
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,165
Who's first?

243
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,331
<i>Back at the model home,
George Michael was still...</i>

244
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,409
<i>trying to make
his accidental marriage work.</i>

245
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,469
I thought maybe tonight we could pop in
an!@%$#%@! in the old DVD player...

246
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,243
and sit and watch it,
maybe just the two of us, husband and wife?

247
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,911
I'm just kidding.
I mean, the State of California isn't, but...

248
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,920
You know, that's what makes it funny.

249
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,490
- I'm worried you're taking this too seriously.
- Are...

250
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,651
Just the opposite.

251
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,694
What the hell is that?

252
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,268
I bought you a wedding ring... tone.

253
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,770
Opposite of serious.

254
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,967
<i>And Michael was getting an update
on how his newest employee, Nellie...</i>

255
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,976
<i>was working out.</i>

256
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,911
Really? And all the guys like her, huh?
That is... That is great.

257
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,948
Uh, you mean "away" though, right?

258
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,609
Because otherwise
it sounds a little different.

259
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,187
But, uh, that's, uh...
that's outstanding.

260
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,620
Real good.
You forgot to say "away" again.

261
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,659
But, uh, listen, let me call you back
in a bit, okay? Bye.

262
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,457
Nellie has blown them all away.

263
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,464
Yeah, well, I think it's crazy.

264
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,899
You've given her access to everything...
the banking... and for what?

265
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,632
You're basing this on the fact she shares a name
with someone you played with as a baby.

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,640
Lindsay, I can tell that it's real.

267
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,210
It's like that feeling that
you read about twins having.

268
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,711
We're twins. You didn't give me
access to the banking.

269
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,341
No, you just... you'd go out and you'd
just whore it up, Lindsay, you know?

270
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,577
She's different.
She's a little bit more like me.

271
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,621
- It's like we finish each other's...
- Sandwiches?

272
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,622
Sentences.

273
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,692
- Why would I say...
- Sandwiches?

274
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,660
That time I was gonna say sandwiches.

275
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,493
- So I guess you haven't told Nellie
what you're thinking. - No, I have not.

276
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,499
I've been waiting for the right time.

277
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,900
I want to make sure she trusts me, especially
since Dad is probably setting her up.

278
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,872
But I might want to hurry with that operation
because she's charging us a fortune...

279
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,773
and she's got this old boss
that's claiming he wants a percentage.

280
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,039
<i>Yo, man, you owe me money. I ain't no dummy.</i>

281
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:12,584
<i>And it better be soon, or you're gonna
feel my hand up your!@%$#.</i>

282
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,313
So Nellie wants to meet me tonight
for drinks. Maybe I'll tell her then.

283
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,686
That's funny. I'm going out tonight
for drinks too... with an exciting new man.

284
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,123
Really trying to make
that marriage work, aren't you?

285
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,424
Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold,
but I'm feeling a little pressure here.

286
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,931
If you had to have sex with Tobias in four months,
you'd be shopping for a way out too.

287
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,196
I stand corrected and disgusted.

288
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,533
<i>And Michael arrived
for his meeting with Nellie.</i>

289
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,539
- Are you Michael?
- Yes.

290
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,542
- There's a nellie at the end of the bar
wants to see you. - Great. Thank you.

291
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,373
- Oh, it's Tobias.
- Michael.

292
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:45,542
Look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered?
Yes. Interested? Not tonight.

293
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,551
I-I think I-I see what's happening.

294
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,417
- You're meeting girl-Michael at the bar?
- It was her idea.

295
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,888
She wanted to get a drink,
and I know it's crazy.

296
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,586
I mean, I'm married.
And the carbs.

297
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,822
Well, Tobias, sometimes life
is about making difficult...

298
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,899
Sandwiches. I know.

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,161
- You read my mind.
- Oh, God. Here she is.

300
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,472
- Next to that guy?
- Uh, what guy?

301
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,474
That guy.

302
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,773
- No, that's her.
- Him?

303
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,779
That's a girl.

304
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,247
I-I think the name Michael
is making you look for a man.

305
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,376
- Think I'm lookin' at a man.
- Michael.

306
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,079
- Yes?
- Yes.

307
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,315
- No, I meant girl-Michael.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.

308
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,359
So nice to meet you, girl-Michael.

309
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,792
What? Yes? Hi, Nellie.

310
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,421
I was thinking that
we could meet down here.

311
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,864
Uh, actually,
I think I'm gonna come up.

312
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,198
I really need to see you.

313
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,534
I really want to see you too.
There's something we need to talk about.

314
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,938
- I've always been mildly attracted to you.
- What?

315
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,273
Let's face it. There's no denying
that there's a heat between us.

316
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,280
- I'd like to deny that.
- I know you feel it too... this burning desire.

317
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,909
I-I-I don't feel anything.
I-I feel a burning mutual respect.

318
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,988
I've got an outfit that's gonna turn
that respect into something fun.

319
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,114
Respect is fun, Nellie.

320
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,557
You're gonna want the respect when
you hear where I... Where is the light?

321
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,561
<i>- Don't touch that light!</i>
- What?

322
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,463
<i>This is what happens when you steal
from Frank's stable without payin'.</i>

323
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,967
You want to be her pimp,
you gotta settle up with me.

324
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,402
- Pimp? You mean that she's a...
<i>- Lady of the evening.</i>

325
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:17,271
<i>Working girl.
She turns illusions for money.</i>

326
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,140
<i>And that's when
Michael recognized the voice.</i>

327
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,145
- Tricks.
- Wait a minute.

328
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,875
Don't you do it! Ain't nobody gonna
see what Frank look like!

329
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,215
Franklin is Frank?

330
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,357
<i>Michael had
just discovered that his brother...</i>

331
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,361
<i>was the pimp for the woman
he thought was his sister.</i>

332
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,931
What the hell is going on?
Nellie is not a prostitute.

333
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,593
Of course she is. Oh, but I can see
what the misunderstanding is.

334
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,830
You didn't know. Maybe we can
give him a family discount!

335
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,237
Family discount is right. This is
the sister that I've been talking about.

336
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,004
Maybe I should've been getting
a family rate. Oh, my God!

337
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,546
- How do you know her?
- Met up with her after a show.

338
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,842
- And you did things with her?
<i>- He didn't.</i>

339
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,353
- I did. <i>- Well, if you consider
crying like a girl doing something.</i>

340
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:06,584
I just want my brother to respect me,
you know. I don't even have a job.

341
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:11,356
Look, I could use a man's voice on the phone,
and I like your little puppet show.

342
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,125
Ain't so little when I take my pants off, lady.

343
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,532
I mean, obviously I'd take
some of the cry out of that.

344
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,729
But I am not a pimp, Michael.

345
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,865
She needed protection,
so I make some threats, I wear this hat...

346
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,103
and I collect my 10%.

347
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,874
Yeah, that's a pimp,
and our sister is a prostitute.

348
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,041
- I'm your sister?
- I think so.

349
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,051
I found you in my dad's computer.

350
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,179
I thought that maybe he was embezzling
money and taking advantage of you.

351
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,383
- And that's why I hired you to do
your work at the office. - Oh, my God.

352
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,722
Wait a minute.
What... What kind of work did you do?

353
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,058
No wonder they were so happy.

354
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,725
- I'm so embarrassed!
- Nellie, hang on a second.

355
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,635
You know, Gob, this might be that sign
from God that you should change your ways.

356
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,674
No, I think that's gonna be something big.

357
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,438
<i>Downstairs, meanwhile,
Lindsay arrived at the bar for her date.</i>

358
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,572
- Michael. Oh, my God! My husband!
- Oh, my God! My wife!

359
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,308
- Are you two here for each other?
- Is that what you're doing?

360
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,852
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

361
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,252
- And with another man!
- And with another woman!

362
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,324
Wait, wait.
You didn't plan this together?

363
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,952
- I just assumed you wanted a Holy Trinity.
- Absolutely not!

364
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,962
We're a happily married couple.

365
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,999
Yes, who happen to be very much
in love with each other.

366
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,502
Well, you're still gonna
have to pay Frank.

367
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,573
<i>- And Michael confronted his father.</i>
- I know who N. Bluth is.

368
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,108
It is Nellie, and I found her.

369
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,838
That's your sissy cousin Larry.

370
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,437
Even then we knew.
That's why we called him Nellie.

371
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,312
Do you not know that expression, Michael?
I thought we were on the same page here.

372
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,852
It's a nice try, Pop, but in your old computer
I found a Nellie.

373
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,218
You're tryin' to tell me that
that is not my sister?

374
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,292
Yes. It's perfectly innocent.
She's my prostitute.

375
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,850
I'm a red-blooded man. I have certain needs
that your mom can't satisfy.

376
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,261
<i>But sex wasn't one of them.</i>

377
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,267
I just want my brother
to hand me my money.

378
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,701
But he's got that hair.

379
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,673
Why can't I have hair and money,
and him nothing?

380
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,335
She's not my sister. I let her into the company.

381
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,814
- You didn't give her access to the cash, did you?
- She said she liked me.

382
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,944
She's a prostitute. That's her job.
Oh, no. The N. Bluth account.

383
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,716
What? The N. Bluth account?
That is your account?

384
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:23,022
Maybe. But it's only embezzlement
if you spend it outside the company.

385
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,824
It's gone. It's empty.

386
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,161
- She got to it.
- There goes the company.

387
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,167
Okay. Now, hold on now.

388
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,727
Let's not panic because
I-I know someone who can find her.

389
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,932
- His name is Frank.
- That's Gob's puppet.

390
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,836
I'm going to prison.

391
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,106
You haven't heard from Oscar
lately, have you?

392
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,681
- No.
- Okay.

393
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,182
<i>And the next day
Michael returned to the office...</i>

394
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,345
<i>to tell the employees
that Black Friday had indeed arrived.</i>

395
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,354
Hey, Ted. What's goin' on?

396
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,254
Nellie got all of us our checks
and these great new computers.

397
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,884
Excuse me. Nellie, you did this?

398
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,225
I took it out of the N. Bluth account.

399
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,697
If you spend it within the company,
it gives the prosecutors nothing.

400
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,792
Also, it was the only way to get myself
the 10 grand that you owed me.

401
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,371
Ten grand? What... What did you
do with these guys exactly?

402
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,703
They mostly just cried.
You've got a real morale problem here.

403
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,972
You cried?

404
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,048
- Listen, I thought that you were going to...
- Steal it?

405
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,379
- Yes.
- But I might be your sister, remember?

406
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,079
The fact that you didn't steal it
might actually be proof that you're not.

407
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,487
Even if we're not related,
I think I would like for you to work here.

408
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,958
You're very, very good at it...

409
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,326
and what you do for a job is not really
a great way to make a living, you know?

410
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,991
- I make 300 grand a year.
- Marry me!

411
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,069
It's weird on so many levels.

412
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,570
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

413
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,640
<i>Gob has a religious conversion.</i>

414
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,232
I've seen a sign,
and I want to make this work.

415
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,609
A committed relationship
that actually means something.

416
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,584
How about you?
You want to do just the two of us?

417
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,315
<i>And Buster's fake coma
is put to its greatest test.</i>

418
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,857
- Don't you die on me. Don't you die on me.
<i>- Oh, my.</i>

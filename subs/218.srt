1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,422
<i>Michael Bluth was working</i>
<i>at home when he noticed something unusual.</i>

6
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,527
That can't be good.

7
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,030
Okay, I checked underneath,
and there is a problem.

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,601
- You know this isn't a real house?
- It's a model house.

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,103
Well, the drain pipes aren't hooked up.
Just empty under the house.

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,402
- <i>Plus, there's a lot ofblue paint down there.</i>
- And some pieces of denim?

11
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,409
- Yeah.
- We've got a guy like that here.

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,706
<i>Well, that's why</i>
<i>your living room is sinking.</i>

13
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,543
And I think the city's
gonna have to red-tag it.

14
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,412
The city is sending out an inspector.

15
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,316
They're gonna be crawling over every inch
of this place. You're going to need to leave.

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,720
Where the hell do you want me to go?
Back to your mother's?

17
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,260
I believe there's a freeloading loser
in my bed.

18
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,386
Buster just lost a hand.
He's going through a lot.

19
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,396
I'm talking about Oscar.

20
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,126
Oh, yes. Your brother.
I can see why that would bug you.

21
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:13,001
<i>In fact, Oscar had stayed with</i>
<i>Lucille primarily to reconnect with Buster...</i>

22
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,974
- <i>whom he secretly believed to be his natural son.</i>
- Hey, Uncle.

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,806
I feel so responsible for that.

24
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,245
<i>Oscar had gotten injured on a shoddy device</i>
<i>George Sr. Had invented...</i>

25
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,079
- <i>when he forgot Buster</i>
<i>was wearing a prosthetic hand.</i>
- Buster! The Cornballer!

26
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,952
- It's my father's fault!
- My fault?

27
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,220
I was trying to keep you
from burning yourself, you idiot!

28
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,763
I mean, yes, yes.
George Sr. Sure rushed this to market.

29
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,458
<i>The only reason she likes him</i>
<i>is he has hair.</i>

30
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,900
And the only reason he has any
is because he's never had any stress.

31
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,370
Yeah? Well, you could save me
a lot of stress if you just turned yourself in.

32
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,672
No, never. I can't go back to the joint.
No, I cannot go back there.

33
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,279
- Hey, man!

34
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,785
Yeah!

35
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,822
- It's a hell-hole.
- I finally got the court to try you in absentia.

36
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,395
Which means we're not supposed to
have any idea where you are.

37
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,955
So you don't have to go to prison,
but you can't stay here.

38
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,401
Remember that French movie we tried to
sneak into once- <i>Dangerous Cousins?</i>

39
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,700
No, l-Why? Did we-

40
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,243
I don't remember that, no.

41
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,403
<i>George Michael remembered very well.</i>

42
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:31,212
<i>In fact, he currently had a copy of the DVD</i>
<i>hidden in his sock drawer.</i>

43
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,046
Kind of.

44
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,212
Why do you ask?

45
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,984
I got passes to the premiere of the American
remake. Supposed to be great.

46
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,185
<i>It wasn't great, and Maeby knew it.</i>

47
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:46,197
<i>The studio at which she'd finagled a job</i>
<i>had hoped to avoid controversy...</i>

48
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,928
<i>by artlessly explaining that the two leads</i>
<i>weren't biological cousins.</i>

49
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,231
<i>Shut up and kiss me!</i>

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,608
- Where is everybody?
- They've been fired.

51
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,609
And you gotta fix this,
or you're gonna be fired too.

52
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,078
- Cut it down if you have to.
- But it's only 71 minutes long.

53
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,174
And it's only, like, 63 minutes long.
So bring Ann.

54
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,480
No, that's not her kind of thing.

55
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,887
I mean, if it maintains any of the complex
eroticism of the French original anyway.

56
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,585
I like the way they think.

57
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,162
<i>And later, at the office,</i>
<i>Michael had another surprise.</i>

58
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,163
This can't be good.

59
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,291
"Michael, it saddens me
greatly to say to you...

60
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,394
"that I can no longer work
at the Bluth Company.

61
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,372
- You've been a great boss"-
- I'm sorry, Tobias. Do you work here?

62
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:32,774
Do I work- I developed an eating disorder
being your assistant, Michael.

63
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,870
I never saw you at the desk.

64
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,916
Well, excuse me if I was too busy
on my knees in front of the toilet, Michael.

65
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,452
"I have a tremendous opportunity...

66
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,454
"now that the Blue Man Group
has dropped their cease-and-desist...

67
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,490
"and invited me to audition in Las Vegas.

68
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,423
Also, I've developed
some issues with food"-

69
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,963
I'm sorry to interrupt one more time.
Is this the real Blue Man Group this time?

70
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,795
<i>Tobias had recently been asked</i>
<i>to address a group of depressed men...</i>

71
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,563
<i>who had been described</i>
<i>over the phone as blue.</i>

72
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,401
I feel like a- idiot.

73
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,948
<i>Fortunately, I found a wonderful circle</i>
<i>of men to get me through that.</i>

74
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,247
Oh, before I forget, your old secretary,
Kitty Sanchez, called...

75
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,844
and wanted to meet with you.

76
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,083
- I penciled her in for 4:00 today.
- Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,921
Oh, this is my fault too?

78
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,258
Everything- No. No!
I will not let this make me eat!

79
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,367
<i>So get this. Tomorrow I gotta go on record</i>
<i>and say I don't know where Dad is.</i>

80
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,495
And now Kitty Sanchez
wants to meet with me.

81
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,039
<i>And meetings with Kitty</i>
<i>had never ended well.</i>

82
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,803
- Say good-bye to these.
- Spring break! Whoo!

83
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,208
- Perhaps this'll jog your memory.
<i>- Oh! They're crooked!</i>

84
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,838
Plus, Dad will not leave the attic,
which means he's gonna get caught...

85
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,849
which means I'm gonna
get caught for hiding him.

86
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,681
Well, why don't you get Gob
to do your dirty work for you?

87
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,688
<i>Shall I knock Dad out</i>
<i>and chain him to a pipe somewhere?</i>

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,224
Or should I risk another
herpes outbreak with Kitty?

89
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,454
- Which is it this time?
- <i>Definitely not one of those two things.</i>

90
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,462
But are you upset about something, Gob?

91
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,523
<i>I made you a thank-you gift last week</i>
<i>about which you haven't said word one.</i>

92
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,196
Come on.
You asked me for $5,000...

93
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,831
so that you could invest
in a Franklin CD.

94
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,967
Now, I assumed that you were
talking about the mutual fund...

95
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,239
and not a compact disc
of you singing to your hand.

96
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,407
<i>Gob had recently made</i>
<i>a recording ofhis ventriloquism act.</i>

97
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,747
"Franklin Comes Alive." Take one.

98
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,514
<i>He hoped it would break down racial</i>
<i>barriers and maybe be a crossover hit.</i>

99
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,648
It ain't easy bein' white

100
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,693
It ain't easy bein' brown

101
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,231
<i>All this pressure to be bright</i>

102
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,893
I got childrens all over town

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,165
Sometimes-
Hey, where'd the guy go?

104
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,503
I tried to express something to you
in a couple of those numbers...

105
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,338
and maybe, just maybe,
heal this country a little bit.

106
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,073
<i>But you, you didn't even</i>
<i>bother to listen to it.</i>

107
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,675
I did listen to it.
L-l-l-I am listening to it. Gob. Hey.

108
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,346
Maybe the reason I didn't say anything
is 'cause I didn't want to embarrass you.

109
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,549
It's my favorite, favorite record.

110
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,751
Well, then you-
you- up.

111
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,419
Because I am so embarrassed.

112
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,226
It's a good CD.
It's a really good CD.

113
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,530
- I can't believe that you love it.
- I love it so much.

114
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,299
Oh, God. Oh, God, look at us.

115
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,773
Crying like a couple of girls.

116
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,245
Aw, you're the only one crying.
But I love the music.

117
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,372
- <i>And the card with your face on it?</i>
- And the healing.

118
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,383
Home run!

119
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,087
We'll do your dirty work
for you, Mikey.

120
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,825
- You leave the rough stuff to Franklin and me.
- Now I gotta listen to that CD.

121
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,623
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>
- Right.

122
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,221
You remember Franklin.

123
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,893
- Hey, Franklin.
<i>- My man!</i>

124
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,994
- How 'bout some tongue?
- Wha- Oh-

125
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,733
<i>But Franklin didn't want to kiss at all.</i>

126
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,275
<i>Gob had soaked</i>
<i>the puppet's mouth in ether.</i>

127
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,609
<i>And downstairs, Tobias shared</i>
<i>his good news with Lindsay.</i>

128
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,979
"...once in a lifetime."

129
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,985
Tobias, I am not uprooting my life
and moving to Vegas.

130
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,352
Maybe this is a sign that our relationship
isn't working, and we should split again.

131
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,984
<i>Wait a second. I thought we</i> were <i>split up,</i>
<i>and this would bring us back together.</i>

132
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,552
Well, maybe the fact that we don't know
if we're together or not...

133
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,030
is a sign that we should split again.

134
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,124
<i>Or stay split up.</i>

135
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,534
Okay, forget about Vegas.
We'll stay here and get back together.

136
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,633
Or stay together and either
rekindle or fan this fire.

137
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:29,010
<i>And soon, Gob was on his way to</i>
<i>dump his father on the police station steps.</i>

138
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,742
Do you forgive me?

139
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,616
<i>And he decided to let himself off the hook</i>
<i>using his ventriloquist skills.</i>

140
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,315
I cherish you, Gob.
Come here and give me a kiss.

141
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,621
I'm driving, Dad.
Now!

142
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,161
<i>It was weird.</i>

143
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>And that's when Gob noticed the CD</i>
<i>and card that he'd made for Michael.</i>

144
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,635
It's not even open. Michael!

145
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:57,471
<i>Meanwhile, Michael's meeting with Kitty</i>
<i>wasn't as distressing as he'd thought.</i>

146
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:02,014
The program has changed my life. And I have
a sponsor now. He's famous.

147
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,173
- That's great.
- <i>I can't tell you who he is.</i>

148
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:08,413
But let's just say that
he was on <i>Night Court.</i>

149
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,648
- Well, you look great.
- I can tell you who it's not.

150
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,656
<i>It's not Bull.</i>
<i>It's not Harry Anderson.</i>

151
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,850
- I got it.
- He's white.

152
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,258
I know who it is.

153
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,423
What happens is, when I don't have
a man in my life, I tend to go a little crazy.

154
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,330
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>But I'm keeping it together now.</i>

155
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:27,532
And I wanted to tell you I'm not gonna
try to hurt you guys anymore.

156
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,905
- Don't suppose I can get that in writing.
- You did try to blow me up.

157
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,604
- Sorry about that.
- Just don't piss me off again.

158
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,443
You all right?

159
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,918
"Oftentimes the heart acts
without consulting the head, and thusly"-

160
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,684
Oh, I see you wasted no time
in filling my seat hole.

161
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:50,421
Oh, no, no. I just came by so that you
could say good-bye to these.

162
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,830
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- It's the last time you're going to be seeing these.

163
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,129
<i>How ironic.</i>
<i>I just found out I'm staying.</i>

164
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,433
- Will you take these back?
- Okay, let's just all put our tops down.

165
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,030
Just put 'em on down.

166
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,109
You're not goin' to Vegas?

167
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,111
Sadly, my wife said no to my dream.

168
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,877
So I shall continue
to toil through this waking life.

169
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:16,011
Wow, you are so real.
Why can't I meet someone like you?

170
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,683
<i>And Michael decided that he</i>
<i>better keep Kitty occupied with a man.</i>

171
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,692
<i>At least until after his meeting.</i>

172
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:26,322
Hey, gang, I got an idea. Tobias, why don't
you take Kitty out for the afternoon?

173
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,332
Huh?

174
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,460
Are you trying to set up your former
assistant with your current assistant?

175
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,473
What a great idea for a
Hugh Grant-Julia Roberts type movie.

176
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:40,069
I recently heard that the actor, John Larroquette,
was looking for a meaty character piece.

177
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,976
<i>And so, free of obstacles...</i>

178
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,777
<i>Michael prepared</i>
<i>to sign the affidavit...</i>

179
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,614
<i>maintaining he had no idea</i>
<i>where his father was.</i>

180
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,450
You have not been in contact with him.
Are you prepared to do that?

181
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,798
Officers!

182
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,204
Michael, these men are here-
just a little bit early-

183
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,707
because we have
photographic evidence...

184
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,835
which discredits
the affidavit you just signed.

185
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,709
Are those balls? 'Cause the last time
we were here, they were balls.

186
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,113
These are not balls. This was taken
with a traffic camera.

187
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:23,780
<i>It shows you in your car with your father</i>
<i>within the last 24 hours.</i>

188
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,957
I wish they were balls.

189
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,159
<i>Michael was in police custody...</i>

190
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,360
<i>after a photo ofhim helping</i>
<i>his father escape had turned up.</i>

191
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,529
Did you see that picture?
That's you, right?

192
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,800
Were you holdin' up
a photo of me or somethin'?

193
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,966
Of course you don't recognize it.

194
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,069
- It's the card from the CD you didn't even open.
- <i>You found that, did you?</i>

195
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,842
Right between the gearbox
and the "pull back from aircraft" lever.

196
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,817
So this is how you repay me
for how I repay you?

197
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,944
I actually did not get
a chance to listen to it yet.

198
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,353
Probably should've told you,
but I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

199
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,254
Oh, you're so sensitive.

200
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,157
Just like when you whipped up those tears
talking about how much you loved it.

201
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:07,494
I will listen to it, I promise. But I'm
in a lot of trouble here. Where is Dad?

202
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,500
I've got him stashed away
somewhere safe now.

203
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,332
- Get him, quickly,
otherwise I'm gonna be stuck in here.
- Good!

204
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,235
- I hope you rot in here!
- What-

205
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,740
And guess what else?
Dad kissed me.

206
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,174
How? He looked pretty unconscious
in that picture.

207
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,044
I didn't say he was totally into it.

208
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,749
<i>And George Michael</i>
<i>tried to break up with Ann.</i>

209
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,084
I can't go out tomorrow night,
'cause there's this movie premiere at-

210
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,987
It's kinda racy, but-

211
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,528
Oh, the cousin one? I can't believe it.
I was just gonna ask you to go.

212
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,395
- You want to see that?
- No, I want to get
the whole church group together.

213
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,399
We're gonna picket those bastards.

214
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,561
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>had only heard Ann swear once before...</i>

215
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:50,267
<i>when hejoined some ofher youth group</i>
<i>to protest the home of Marc Cherry...</i>

216
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,708
<i>executive producer</i>
<i>of the hit show</i> Desperate Housewives.

217
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,976
- It's a satire!
<i>- There's nothing funny about fornication!</i>

218
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,983
The bastard saw us!

219
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:03,078
<i>And the promise of another kiss</i>
<i>was too enticing to turn down.</i>

220
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,350
<i>Well, yes. The bastards.</i>

221
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,053
<i>Oscar, meanwhile,</i>
<i>checked in on Buster.</i>

222
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,130
Buster! Buster! Be careful!

223
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,325
- It's not a real hand, remember?
- I'm so forgetful.

224
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,629
- I hope you don't get that from me.
- <i>Get that from you?</i>

225
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,398
Do you feel okay?

226
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,497
Just forget it!

227
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,942
I wanted to share my Pop Secret with you.
Oh, but forget it!

228
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,843
Pop secret?

229
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,916
Pop se- Is Oscar my real father?

230
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,011
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was on the phone with Michael.</i>

231
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,684
They're keeping me overnight.
Could you tell my son I'm on a business trip?

232
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,261
- Why can't the girl at work do it?
- Tobias?

233
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,092
I sent him on a date with Kitty
to keep her off our backs.

234
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,133
You better hope Lindsay doesn't find out.
She'll be devastated.

235
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,102
- Find out what?
- Your husband's dating Kitty the whore.

236
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,765
<i>He is? That's</i>- <i>That's horrible.</i>

237
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,843
Do I know my daughter?

238
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,934
She only wants what she can't have.

239
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,444
Since you're devastating people...

240
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,913
tell Gob I'll be telling the cops
it was him in the truck...

241
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,916
so he'll be joining me here.

242
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,509
I've got a nice, hard cot
with his name on it.

243
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,455
- You'd do that to your own brother?
- I said "cot."

244
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,788
Where's Mother?

245
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:19,092
You lied to me. You said my father
was my father, but my uncle is my father.

246
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,656
My father is my uncle!

247
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:27,296
<i>At that moment, the guards</i>
<i>played a CD they'd recently confiscated.</i>

248
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,705
Now I got a special thank you
to the brother who made this happen.

249
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,607
Is that Franklin?

250
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,518
<i>Michael realized that</i>
<i>he could never turn his brother in.</i>
<i>- Michael!</i>

251
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,530
- <i>Gob, meanwhile, was having a similar epiphany.</i>

252
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:06,376
Barry, it's Gob.
Tell Michael not to testify.

253
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,174
I'm bringing in Dad.

254
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,351
Franklin.

255
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,683
You've ruined the act, Gob.

256
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,917
<i>And Lucille confronted Oscar.</i>

257
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,722
- You told him you were his father?
- I did no such thing!

258
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,421
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

259
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,965
Not this time.
I've had enough of you.

260
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,695
So say good-bye to these,
because it's the last time-

261
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,204
<i>And Ann in a protest at the theater.</i>

262
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,037
George Michael?
Are you protesting this?

263
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,078
- This isn't the line?
- Yes, he is protesting this.

264
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,114
He even helped me make the signs.

265
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,241
Well, only mine and the one that says,
"This is a tricky, gray area."

266
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,377
- What are you guys protesting?
- It's a disgusting movie...

267
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,580
about cousins
who are into each other.

268
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,316
Are there any more seats?

269
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,791
Yeah. It's the best 52 minutes
you'll spend all day.

270
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,090
Oh, no. We're making it worse.

271
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,995
Prepare to be swallowed
into the depths of hell!

272
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,501
- I guess that means no kiss?
- I'm not really in the mood for a kiss.

273
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,833
This isn't Marc Cherry's house.

274
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,310
- Where's your dad?
- I don't know. I just got here.

275
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,747
Oh, that's right.
Mother told me he went to jail.

276
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,115
I'm so mad at her.

277
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,415
- Guess who I just found out my father is?
- Jail?

278
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,082
Oscar! He didn't mean to tell me,
but I figured it out.

279
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,854
- No, I mean, my dad is in jail?
- I wouldn't worry about it. Barry's very good.

280
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:35,093
<i>I'm going to take a long shower. I don't</i>
<i>even want to smell like Mother anymore.</i>

281
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,191
I don't think we're supposed
to shower right now, Bus-

282
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,964
- Tobias back yet?
- No.

283
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,198
Oh, my God. He's really out with her.

284
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,968
- Are you drunk?
- Not enough.

285
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,942
I pushed him right into
someone else's skanky, bony arms.

286
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,013
Well, let me tell you something,
George Michael.

287
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,014
You have to grab love while you have it.
Don't let it get away.

288
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,447
Oh, there you are.

289
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,782
Oh, Maeby, everything's fine.
Your daddy's just out.

290
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,617
Yeah, we're doing great.

291
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,317
Mommy's gonna take a bath
with a bottle of wine.

292
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,326
- I don't know if we're supposed to use-
- So get this.

293
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,694
All the press actually made the premiere a hit.
There's lines for the next show.

294
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,290
Thanks, buddy.

295
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,394
Hey, look at that.
We didn't get swallowed up into hell.

296
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,900
<i>And that's when George Michael</i>
<i>finally got close to Maeby...</i>

297
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,038
<i>who, by the way, might not</i>
<i>be his biological cousin.</i>

298
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,642
<i>Just then, Gob came home to retrieve</i>
<i>his father from where he'd stashed him.</i>

299
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,551
- Dad's gonna be crushed.
- You don't have to tell him!

300
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,318
<i>But Gob was referring</i>
<i>to his own father...</i>

301
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,588
<i>who he had hidden under the house.</i>

302
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,560
Uh-oh.

303
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,330
<i>Gob had hidden his father</i>
<i>under a house that hadjust collapsed.</i>

304
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,997
Children, you're small.
Crawl under there.

305
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,507
- <i>We don't want to go under there.</i>
- He's not under there.

306
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,509
He got away. Thank God.

307
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,843
<i>But then Gob remembered that this meant</i>
<i>Michael would have to go to prison.</i>

308
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,618
- We-
- l-

309
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,180
<i>And Michael and Barry</i>
<i>made their way to the arraignment.</i>

310
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,850
Gob is bringing your father.
Everything is going to work out fine.

311
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,226
I wish they'd hurry up.
But I gotta tell you, I am a little torn.

312
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,427
My father, he has created
a lot of problems for the family...

313
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,301
and by staying in the attic he was insuring
I would go to jail with him, but-

314
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,174
Well, maybe I'm not so torn.

315
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,039
- Michael. Barry.
- Hey, Gob.

316
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,308
- Where's Dad?
- Great news. Dad wasn't crushed to death.

317
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,076
- Was there risk of that?
- <i>Yes.</i>

318
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,741
Well, I handcuffed him
under the house.

319
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,979
But he got free- the pipes I chained him
to weren't connected to anything.

320
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,148
- Oh, I'm not prepared for this case.
- Are you insane?

321
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:44,628
- No "thank you" for trying?
- I'm sick of you needing constant
validation for screwing up.

322
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,224
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna tell them it was you in the stair car.

323
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,303
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

324
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,737
First, I'm gonna beat the crap out of you,
then I'm gonna call an ambulance.

325
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,742
Then knowing you, I'm gonna have
to wait for some kind of an apology.

326
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,747
Come here!

327
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:09,086
<i>As the boys set to once again</i>
<i>fighting in front of the courthouse</i>-

328
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,952
- Stop it! Stop it!
- <i>the family began to show up for the arraignment.</i>

329
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:16,357
<i>I know you're in the middle of something,</i>
<i>but I'm afraid I can't work for you today.</i>

330
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,487
I'm going to Vegas with Kitty.

331
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,293
<i>But Lindsay wasn't</i>
<i>about to lose her man without a fight.</i>

332
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,425
Over my dead body!

333
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,765
<i>Oh, my</i>-

334
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:30,137
Hey! Hey! I said- I said enough!

335
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,005
Now, stop it.

336
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,309
I am so tired of this family fighting.
The anger ends now.

337
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,818
You're brothers, and brothers
stick together no matter what.

338
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,854
<i>Families stick together.</i>

339
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,687
I have torn this family apart
with my lies and my cowardice...

340
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,523
but that comes to an end now.

341
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,187
<i>So I'm turning myself in.</i>

342
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,789
I don't want you to come
and visit me in prison this time.

343
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,330
'Cause you deserve Oscar now.

344
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,345
<i>Tobias, I actually fought for you.</i>

345
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,348
I can't believe it.

346
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,250
- I'm going to Vegas with Kitty.
- <i>Huh?</i>

347
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,989
Oh, George, I've lost you again.

348
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,531
Take back Oscar, Mother.

349
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,533
I think I lost him too.

350
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,661
<i>In fact, Oscar</i>
<i>was on his way out of town...</i>

351
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,171
<i>when he was approached by George Sr...</i>

352
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,242
<i>who hadjust escaped</i>
<i>from under the house.</i>

353
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,369
I want you to turn me in so you can
get the reward, take care of the family.

354
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,675
Why would you do that for me?

355
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,409
Because we're brothers.

356
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:51,044
<i>Later, while George Sr. Was shaving</i>
<i>his unconscious brother's head...</i>

357
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:55,559
<i>he wondered whether there really was</i>
<i>a reward, and ifhe could get it.</i>

358
00:19:55,661 --> 00:20:00,496
<i>But there was no time, and getting even</i>
<i>with his brother was reward enough.</i>

359
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,135
<i>So it was Oscar who was going to be</i>
<i>spending a little time alone in prison.</i>

360
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,697
I guess Dad finally came through for us.
He actually made a sacrifice.

361
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,970
Although who knows
what he's up to.

362
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,878
We should just stay away from him,
let him have a little time alone in prison.

363
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,780
He is right about one thing, though.
We're brothers. We shouldn't be fighting.

364
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,217
- We cannot afford to lose each other.
- I can't.

365
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,085
- I already lost a brother today.
- Franklin?

366
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,954
Well, I didn't lose him.
But he's all puckered and white.

367
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,893
On the plus side, you can take him
to lunch at the club now.

368
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,396
That's the kind of joke
he would have loved.

369
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,398
Oh, man!

370
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,965
- Please don't do this.

371
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,236
- All right.

372
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,012
<i>On the next season</i>
<i>of</i> Arrested Development.

373
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,641
I burned them on a Cornballer.

374
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:58,155
<i>Oscar, robbed of his fingerprints,</i>
<i>has difficulty proving his identity...</i>

375
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,157
My hair's gonna grow back.
You'll see.

376
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,193
<i>Tobias and Kitty go to Vegas...</i>

377
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,457
- <i>only to find that his dream job has been filled.</i>
- You found someone already?

378
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,429
Just came out of nowhere, this guy.

379
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:11,332
<i>And the great thing is,</i>
<i>he's never out of character.</i>

380
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>And George Sr. Turns out to be right</i>
<i>about the effects of stress.</i>

381
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,437
What's happening to me?
Why won't it grow back?

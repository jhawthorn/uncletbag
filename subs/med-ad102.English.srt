00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,693
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:09,795
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,973
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:23,485
Another setback for the once
prominent Bluth family...

6
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:25,487
<i>as their frozen banana stand...</i>

7
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,887
<i>a Newport Beach landmark</i>
<i>burns to the ground.</i>

8
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,449
<i>A delicious whodunit after this.</i>

9
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,554
<i>A week before the fire...</i>

10
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:37,997
<i>Michael Bluth was trying</i>
<i>to save the Bluth Company...</i>

11
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:41,502
- <i>but his father was making it difficult.</i>
- I need the flight records, Dad.

12
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,732
I'm trying to find some money
for the family.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,741
There's always money in the banana stand.

14
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:49,073
I am having a love affair with this ice
cream sandwich. Want some?

15
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,079
- You wanna take a bite? Take a bite.
- Please. Please.

16
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,672
- Come on. Take a bite. Bite.
- The S.E.C. has locked up our funds.

17
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:57,082
- These guys aren't messing around.
- No touching!

18
00:00:57,187 --> 00:01:00,020
So I need you to tell me.
Were you taking vacations in the jet?

19
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:02,182
Is that what you're hiding from me?

20
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:05,819
I haven't had a vacation in years.
This is my vacation.

21
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:08,329
I'm exercising.
I'm sleeping well.

22
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:13,130
- You're doing time.
- I'm doing the time of my life!

23
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:16,433
- What's up, pumpkin?
- Hey. T-Bone!

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,440
- What's up?
- Yeah. T-Bone's my roommate.

25
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,601
- Oh.
- He's a flamer.

26
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,510
- T's checking out today.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

27
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,946
Well, I guess every vacation's
gotta come to an end.

28
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,454
You just made a fool out of yourself
in front ofT-Bone.

29
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:37,288
Anyway, I want you to give him
a job at the company. Sales.

30
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,294
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

31
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,296
- Because we don't have any money.
- Because he's a flamer?

32
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:45,027
- I told you that in confidence.
- You don't seem to understand
I'm running this company now...

33
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,899
and I need the flight records,
and I'm gonna get them...

34
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:50,472
- with or without your help.
- All right.

35
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:54,135
<i>No touching!</i>

36
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:56,735
I got something we can try, all right?
It's a little risky.

37
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:59,178
- Please.
- Open up.

38
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:01,648
What do you mean about...

39
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:06,045
<i>While George Sr. was losing a roommate...</i>

40
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:09,216
<i>George Michael was having</i>
<i>a hard time adjusting to his new one.</i>

41
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:11,226
Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up.

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,989
- <i>Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.</i>
- I'm up!

43
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,997
Okay, we are just about
ass to ankles back here, Maeby.

44
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,091
Do you wanna hop on
your cousin's lap there, please?

45
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,663
<i>Whoa, bumpy road ahead.</i>

46
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:30,444
<i>So, he addressed his problem head-on.</i>

47
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,512
Dad, I wanna work more hours
at the banana stand.

48
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:37,553
Wow. Huh.
Well, that's great.

49
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:40,214
You know, I used to be
just like you when I was a kid.

50
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:44,783
I used to love it there.
- <i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>our best summer ever, Mikey!</i>

51
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:49,223
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna give you a promotion.

52
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:51,357
Welcome aboard, Mr. Manager.

53
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,561
Wow! I'm Mr. Manager!

54
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,695
Well, manager.
We just say "manager."

55
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:58,968
<i>And you can hire an employee</i>
<i>if you need one.</i>

56
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:02,203
- Do you think I need one?
- Don't look at me, Mr. Manager.

57
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:05,907
Right. It's up to me now.
I'm Mr. Manager.

58
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:09,110
- Manager. We just say...
- I know, but you just...

59
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,210
It doesn't matter who.

60
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,320
I don't know what I expected.

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,924
What's going on? This is exactly where the two
of you were when I left this morning.

62
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:28,732
- Is nobody gonna even try to get a job?
- I have a job, Michael.

63
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:33,241
- It's called supporting my husband.
- You haven't been shopping.

64
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,811
The only thing I found in the freezer
was a dead dove in a bag.

65
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:39,609
<i>You didn't eat that, did you? 'Cause I've</i>
<i>only got a couple days left to return it.</i>

66
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:42,776
<i>Died right in the middle</i>
<i>of a show.</i>

67
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:46,515
- Do you want a cage for that?
- No. I'm a magician.

68
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,330
What is your return policy,
by the way?

69
00:03:55,432 --> 00:03:59,129
<i>Not that I have to defend myself, but</i>
<i>for your information, I did go shopping.</i>

70
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,601
You spent $68
on hair conditioner?

71
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,572
A small price to pay
for self-esteem, Michael.

72
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:08,610
Or are you still jealous that you lost Best Hair
to me in high school and got Dorkiest?

73
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,805
<i>Lindsay's achievements in high school...</i>

74
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:14,350
<i>had always overshadowed Michael's.</i>

75
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:17,443
I agree with Michael. It's important
not to tie your self-esteem...

76
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:20,148
into how you look or
what people think of you.

77
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:22,349
I mean, look at me.
I'm an actor.

78
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,121
An actor,
for crying out loud!

79
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:28,823
You know how much rejection
I face every day?

80
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,594
But in this business of show...

81
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:34,192
you have to have the heart
of an angel...

82
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:37,239
and the hide of an elephant.

83
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,467
But you've never actually
had an audition.

84
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:43,645
Well...

85
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:47,183
excuse me!

86
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:53,115
Excuse me.

87
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:56,021
<i>Some really great spousal support.</i>
<i>You know something, Lindsay?</i>

88
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:58,890
You might wanna start thinking about the
example you're setting for your daughter...

89
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:01,020
unless you want her
to end up just like you.

90
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,531
Yeah. Shoot me
when that happens.

91
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,898
Is there a carbon monoxide leak
in this house?

92
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:12,197
<i>George Michael, you're taking</i>
<i>your cousin to work today.</i>

93
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:16,039
That's your new employee. I do not want my niece
to end up just like everyone in this family.

94
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,774
Uh-uh. You're not telling my daughter
what to do. She's a child!

95
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:21,908
No, I'm not. I can work.

96
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:26,182
I don't know about this. I mean,
it can get pretty hairy in there.

97
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,189
Fine. Do what you want.

98
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,851
If I know my daughter,
that stand won't be there in a week.

99
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,020
You stay on top of her, buddy.

100
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:39,090
Do not be afraid
to ride her. Hard.

101
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:46,303
<i>George Michael's attempt</i>
<i>to distance himself...</i>

102
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,344
<i>from his cousin proved unsuccessful.</i>

103
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:57,484
I can't tell you how many health codes
you're violating right now.

104
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,578
I can't believe
I volunteered for this.

105
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,988
This is my stupidest
rebellion ever.

106
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:05,925
Hey, do you wanna
go play Skee-Ball?

107
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,827
Wait... This is the cash drawer.

108
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:10,832
My dad's gonna come by
at the end of the weekend...

109
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:13,596
and the number of bananas has to match
the amount of money in here.

110
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:16,263
- Oh, so it all has to even out?
- Exactly.

111
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:19,864
Easy. Banana.

112
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:22,001
Buck.

113
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,705
Banana. Take a buck.

114
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,339
<i>And Michael went to his mother</i>
<i>for the flight records...</i>

115
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,748
<i>his father wouldn't give him.</i>

116
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:33,880
<i>Then why don't you marry</i>
<i>an ice cream sandwich?</i>

117
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,288
- I gotta go.
- Who was that? Was that Dad?

118
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:39,452
- That was Gob.
- Uh-huh.

119
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:41,826
- So, Mom, I'm trying to find...
- I don't know where they are.

120
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,491
these flight records.

121
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,626
You know, it's really more
believable if you let me finish.

122
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:49,728
<i>Why am I the only one that seems to</i>
<i>get how much trouble this family is in?</i>

123
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,569
Oh, I get it, Michael.
I get it.

124
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,133
But how should I know where the records
are kept? Your father's in charge of all that.

125
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,237
No, I'm in charge of all of that.

126
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:00,714
And I think that you do know
where they are.

127
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:03,047
Oh, it's probably all in
a storage unit somewhere.

128
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:05,052
Where is the storage unit?

129
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:07,054
- I don't remember.
- Try.

130
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:10,990
Something with "Dale."
I don't know. Brookfeather.

131
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:13,392
<i>Raintree. It's hot.</i>
<i>It's very hot there.</i>

132
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:16,021
- I've never been. Get a warrant!
- Don't think I won't.

133
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:20,062
Mother... Mother, I care
about this family.

134
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,036
And I do, too, my darling.

135
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,165
That's why I'm worried about Gob. I was
on the phone with him this morning.

136
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:30,235
You mean just now, right?
When I came in?

137
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:34,442
Yes, just now, when you came in.
And he's upset. He's very upset.

138
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,348
You haven't included him in the business at all.

139
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:40,286
He's your older brother.
You could find a little job for him.

140
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,689
- Make him feel special.
- But he's not special, Mother.

141
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,318
No.

142
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:49,694
But he loves you.
We all love you.

143
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:53,166
- Where's the storage unit?
- It's with your warrant.

144
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:57,362
Luz, that coat cost
more than your house!

145
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:02,373
Oh, that's how we joke.
She doesn't even have a house.

146
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:07,773
<i>The next day, Tobias looked for work.</i>

147
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,647
<i>Hmm.</i> Actor Pull.

148
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,890
Ooh.

149
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,059
Oh, look at all these parts!

150
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:27,025
Tobias, nice to see you off the couch.

151
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:30,902
<i>I was looking for work, and I blew it, Michael.</i>

152
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,532
I guess you've already
seen that, huh?

153
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:37,135
Yes, I have.
Oh, right. This one.

154
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,771
Yeah, I'll call them again,
I guess.

155
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,180
I'll give them one more shot.

156
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,515
<i>And that's when Michael</i>
<i>figured out how to get his mother...</i>

157
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,579
<i>to lead him to the storage unit</i>
<i>where the flight records were kept.</i>

158
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,451
- Hello.
- Hey, Mom, it's Michael. Listen.

159
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,588
Before I forget,
I talked to the I.R. S<i>...</i>

160
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,666
and they wanna come by
your apartment today...

161
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,429
to see if you charged any
big-ticket stuff to the company.

162
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:03,994
Furs or...

163
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:05,938
I don't know.
just a heads-up.

164
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:11,036
Oh, that poor woman.

165
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:16,183
<i>So Michael followed Luz...</i>

166
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,219
<i>who had been sent</i>
<i>to hide the evidence.</i>

167
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:21,757
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias had arranged</i>
<i>an audition for a local commercial.</i>

168
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,826
<i>Lindsay came along</i>
<i>to appear supportive.</i>

169
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:27,987
- This could take a while.
- Honey, it's one line.

170
00:09:28,097 --> 00:09:30,122
Not if I do my job right.

171
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:34,329
First of all, I love it.
Quick question though.

172
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:39,306
Am I panicked about the fire,
or am I being brave for everyone else?

173
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,640
The fire...
It's... It's a fire sale.

174
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,916
Oh. Oh.

175
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,917
Okay, I didn't, um...

176
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,078
<i>Well, let's give it a shot.</i>

177
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:58,216
Oh, my God!
We're having a fire... sale.

178
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:01,785
Oh, the burning!
It burns me!

179
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:05,163
<i>Evacuate all the schoolchildren!</i>

180
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:10,205
?? This isn't a fever!

181
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,069
I can't even see
where the knob is!

182
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,516
And scene.

183
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,781
Um...

184
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,618
Would you like to try that
a little simpler maybe?

185
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:33,057
No.

186
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:37,932
Okay. Anybody else?
Anyone?

187
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,202
Lindsay Bluth?

188
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,204
- It's Fünke.
- Roger Danish.

189
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,501
Look at you.
I can't believe it's Lindsay Bluth.

190
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:47,075
- Oh!
- Fünke.

191
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:49,906
Roger was my male counterpart
in high school.

192
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,610
Remember how crazy
our hair was back then?

193
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:56,651
What were we thinking?
So what are you doing now?

194
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:58,947
- He's, uh, casting my commercial.
- Oh...

195
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:02,286
Yeah, trying to. The South Coast
Boutique is having a fire sale.

196
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,952
South Coast Boutique?
They're having a fire sale?

197
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was</i>
<i>still following his mother's housekeeper.</i>

198
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:24,074
<i>And she did finally</i>
<i>lead him to the storage unit.</i>

199
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,411
<i>Unfortunately, it was on fire.</i>

200
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:34,980
Somebody wanted this place to go.

201
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:39,755
- Yeah? What do you mean, arson?
- Oh, definitely the work of a flamer.

202
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,615
It shoots tomorrow,
and are you ready for this?

203
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,419
- It pays 1,000 bucks!
- Mmm. I thought that was Tobias's part.

204
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,823
Yes. No. No,
I did not book this one.

205
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:15,659
I, uh... I think I made the,
uh, fire too real, uh, for them...

206
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:18,734
and, uh... and probably failed
to highlight the sale.

207
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:23,237
<i>So, good for her.</i>
<i>And, uh, will you excuse me, please?</i>

208
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,269
Well, that's great,
but I've got my own problems.

209
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:30,572
The flight records?
They burned up.

210
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,446
That's fine. That's over with.
But I think Dad is behind it.

211
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,678
I think Dad is trying
to run the business from prison.

212
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:40,950
<i>Well, isn't that ironic?</i>
<i>I'm making a fortune at my newjob...</i>

213
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:43,389
and you don't even have
the job you thought you did.

214
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:47,155
But you don't have a job. You've got a
job offer. Anybody can get a job offer.

215
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,492
So, I'm gonna go see Dad,
because this is my business to run now.

216
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:56,970
Your business?

217
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,472
Hey, there you are, Gob.

218
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,841
I have been looking all over for you.

219
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,346
I could really use some help.

220
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,351
Well, I was gonna return this dove.

221
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:13,251
What are you... You want me to run
a meeting for you or something?

222
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:16,291
Or, even better,
could you mail this letter for me?

223
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:19,088
You can't just give that
to a mailman?

224
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:22,687
I can't trust a mailman with this.
This is important.

225
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:25,266
<i>Gob was intrigued.</i>
<i>He also suspected...</i>

226
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:28,166
<i>he couldn't return a completely</i>
<i>frozen dove to a pet store...</i>

227
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:31,138
<i>and get the full refund</i>
<i>he felt he was entitled to.</i>

228
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,937
I'll mail that letter.
- <i>Michael then went</i>
<i>to confront his father.</i>

229
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,343
You are not going to keep
running the company from in here, okay?

230
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,109
That's why you wanted me
to give T-Bone a job?

231
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:45,153
- To pay him back
for burning down the storage unit?
- Michael, that's ridiculous.

232
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:48,280
Well, I'm not hiring him. No.
We don't have the money, Pop.

233
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:50,951
There's always money in the banana stand.

234
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,793
The banana stand! You know, that's
exactly what this feels like. Huh?

235
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:58,958
Like I'm still stuck in that hot booth
all summer with you pulling the strings.

236
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,969
What was I gonna do, put a kid in charge
of a frozen banana stand?

237
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:04,562
Sure. That's what I did.
I just made my son the manager.

238
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:09,076
George Michael is running
the frozen banana stand now?

239
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:13,842
That's right. Yeah. You sit with that.
You think about that for a while.

240
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:16,315
<i>George Sr. did think about that.</i>

241
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:23,315
Well, now that we've got an employee,
we can go have dinner.

242
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:29,894
We throw away a banana for every buck
we take so no one finds out.

243
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,399
Wait a minute.
I think you should do that math again.

244
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,368
- Why? Is it wrong?
- It's fine.

245
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,929
He's an arsonist, not an embezzler.

246
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,204
<i>Meanwhile, Michael got</i>
<i>an urgent call from his mother.</i>

247
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,506
Gob is unhappy.

248
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:47,173
Again? I tried to include him.
I gave him a job.

249
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:50,775
- You gave him a letter to mail.
- Don't tell me that was too much for him.

250
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:54,083
No, Michael, he mailed the letter.
That's not the point.

251
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,421
<i>Gob had not mailed the letter,</i>
<i>but, in an act of defiance...</i>

252
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:59,892
<i>dramatically hurled the letter</i>
<i>into the sea.</i>

253
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:06,399
<i>This proved a more difficult dramatic</i>
<i>gesture than he'd anticipated.</i>

254
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,408
- So what do you want me to do about it?
- Don't take that tone.

255
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:25,920
He's my son.
I want you to make him stop calling me.

256
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:28,546
<i>Am I the only one</i>
<i>who works in this family?</i>

257
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:31,524
<i>Yes, that's my gal.</i>

258
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:35,028
Who would have imagined... two actors
in one family?

259
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,565
We're like the Lunts!

260
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:43,400
- You see... Excuse me.
- Mama.

261
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:47,237
<i>And so, Lindsay and Maeby</i>
<i>separately went to the same restaurant...</i>

262
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:50,073
<i>to celebrate thejobs</i>
<i>they hadn't actually performed...</i>

263
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,670
<i>with money they</i>
<i>hadn't actually earned.</i>

264
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,751
Did you enjoy your meal, Mom?
You drank it fast enough.

265
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:58,319
- <i>Hi, Lucille!</i>
- Not as much as you enjoyed yours.

266
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:00,355
You want your belt to buckle,
not your chair.

267
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:03,482
Okay, this is what I
told Tobias you'd do.

268
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:06,322
Say what you will about him.
At least he's happy for me.

269
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,262
You know, I think we might
be doubling our losses here.

270
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,101
Because, I mean, for every dollar you
take, you're actually taking two dollars...

271
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,607
because we paid for the bananas.

272
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:22,836
Oh, my God, you're right.

273
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:28,008
I am? Oh, God, I've screwed this up!
Okay, we gotta go.

274
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:33,282
- Oh, my God! It's your mom and Gangy.
- <i>What are they doing here?</i>

275
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:35,289
They're grown-ups. They're allowed
to have fun whenever they want.

276
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:38,326
We're kids. We're supposed to be working.
Now they're gonna tell my dad...

277
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,759
and he's gonna come check the totals
and know we took the money.

278
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,024
- Oh, God, this is bad. What are we gonna do?
- Look.

279
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:46,693
Pop-pop, he's a business man.
What would he do?

280
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:49,805
Bananas Foster.

281
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,007
You might wanna let that fire go out
before you stick your face in it.

282
00:16:58,113 --> 00:17:00,377
That's funny, 'cause I was gonna say,
"You might wanna lean away from that fire...

283
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,145
since you're soaked in alcohol."

284
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,321
Mine was better.

285
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:05,980
Mine was better.

286
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,988
Welcome to Bluth Bananas,
where bananas are our business.

287
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,990
May I interest you
in a banana this day?

288
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:14,324
- T-Bone, what are you doing here?
- Your dad gave me this job.

289
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,866
<i>Michael realized that his father</i>
<i>had even taken control...</i>

290
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,992
<i>of the banana stand.</i>

291
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:22,002
<i>But he still had some</i>
<i>unanswered questions...</i>

292
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,901
<i>so he did</i>
<i>a little detective work.</i>

293
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:25,906
- You burn down the storage unit?
- Oh, most definitely.

294
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:34,178
Michael, having a nice day
at the beach...

295
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:37,343
while the rest of us are busting
our asses to deliver your mail?

296
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,786
What do you want me to say?
You go and complain to Mom...

297
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,051
- and I tried to include you.
- Include me?

298
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:45,683
- Yeah.
- I should be in charge. I'm the older brother.

299
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:50,356
- Please, do you even wanna be in charge?
- No! But I'd like to be asked.

300
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,798
This is just like when we were kids,
and you were the only one...

301
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,928
- he let work in the banana stand.
- Well, I got news for you.

302
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,201
Dad still doesn't trust me to this day.
He treats me like a low-level employee.

303
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:02,402
Better than being treated
like the goofball...

304
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,207
the joker, the magician.

305
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,616
I thought you were gonna do,
like, a trick there.

306
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,618
- A fireball or something.
- I was. It didn't go off.

307
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,620
These things never go off when you want them to.

308
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:16,054
- My least consistent trick.
- Hang on one sec. Hello.

309
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:19,150
- Hey, Uncle Michael, it's me, Maeby.
- Where's George Michael?

310
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:23,891
At the banana stand. He's about to do
something really irresponsible.

311
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,763
<i>You</i> think it's irresponsible?
I'll be right there.

312
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,535
- I'm gonna get blamed for this.
- <i>George Michael.</i>

313
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,665
- Dad.
- Hey, what are you doing?

314
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:38,406
I was just, uh...
I was burning down the banana stand.

315
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:41,244
- What?
- I'm sorry. I screwed it all up.

316
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,250
I've got no right to
call myself Mr. Manager.

317
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:45,183
- Manager.
- Manager. I'm sorry, Dad.

318
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:48,347
- Oh, George Michael.
- I am. But I'll make it up to you.

319
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,186
I'll work weeknights.
I'll lay people off.

320
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,089
I'll give up my summer,
all my summers.

321
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,162
just just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

322
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:58,757
<i>Michael realized he had done</i>
<i>to his son what his father had done to him...</i>

323
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,267
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

324
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,305
- Burn it down.
- What?

325
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,239
Let's burn this son of a bitch.

326
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,277
This is gonna be
our best summer ever, buddy.

327
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,152
<i>And so, Michael, his son</i>
<i>and his brother together enjoyed...</i>

328
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:30,561
<i>the cathartic burning</i>
<i>of the banana stand.</i>

329
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,863
You mailed that
insurance check, right, Gob?

330
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:51,114
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>Lindsay woke up late in the day...</i>

331
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,415
<i>hungover from celebrating</i>
<i>her one day of employment...</i>

332
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:56,184
<i>which, it turns out,</i>
<i>she had slept through.</i>

333
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,885
All right, Lindsay, forget it.
We'll get someone else.

334
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:01,155
<i>Tobias was next on the call list</i>...

335
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,163
<i>but, unfortunately, couldn't hear the phone</i>...

336
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:06,860
<i>over the sound of the shower.</i>

337
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,698
<i>He did, however,</i>
<i>use Lindsay's conditioner...</i>

338
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:12,069
- and was surprised to find that
it did help his self-esteem.
- Mornin'.

339
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:14,699
- You look nice.
- What?

340
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,710
You look
very handsome today.

341
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,677
Thank you, Lindsay.

342
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,580
<i>And Michael finally got to show</i>
<i>his father who's boss.</i>

343
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:26,450
- You what?
- Burned it right down to the ground.

344
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:30,013
Are you crazy?
There was money in that banana stand.

345
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,094
Well, it's all gone now, Dad,
and it was my decision.

346
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,254
So the next time you wanna have
a little power struggle...

347
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,696
just remember that
you're playing with fire.

348
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,203
There was $250,000 lining the walls
of the banana stand.

349
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:45,467
- What?
- Cash, Michael.

350
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:48,372
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- How much clearer can I say...

351
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:52,413
"There's always money
in the banana stand"?

352
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,414
- No touching! No touching!
- No touching!

353
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,882
- No touching! No touching!
- <i>No touching!</i>

354
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:59,385
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

355
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:03,288
<i>Gob protests the pet store's</i>
<i>frozen dove exchange policy.</i>

356
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,952
Return from whence you came!

357
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:08,120
<i>And, Michael, realizing</i>
<i>the banana stand...</i>

358
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,563
<i>is the only profitable part</i>
<i>of the Bluth empire, decides to rebuild.</i>

359
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:15,228
You couldn't have called me?
I can't swing a hammer?

360
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:20,402
I got a rabbit to buy.

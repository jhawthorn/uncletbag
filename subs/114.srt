00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:23,540
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth was</i>
<i>infatuated with his brother's girlfriend, Marta...</i>

6
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:26,078
<i>a Spanish-language</i>
<i>soap opera star.</i>

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,708
<i>But when he found out she was interested</i>
<i>in a man named Hermano, he confronted her.</i>

8
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,719
<i>Unfortunately, he discovered too late...</i>

9
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>that</i> "hermano"
<i>in Spanish meant "brother,"</i>

10
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:41,593
<i>and the person Marta was infatuated with</i>
<i>was, in fact, himself.</i>

11
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:47,157
<i>This was distracting Michael the next day when</i>
<i>he went to meet his father's attorney at prison.</i>

12
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:49,668
Look, there is nothing to it.
It's an arraignment.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,400
They announce the charges.
However, it would help if you all showed up...

14
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:56,840
Iooking like a loving,
supportive family.

15
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:59,071
- For how long?
- Ten minutes, tops.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,081
See if you can
get it down to five.

17
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:05,619
<i>You know, maybe I should confess</i>
<i>these crimes, save everybody the trouble.</i>

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,248
Oh, get off the mount. You're coming home,
guilty or somehow found not guilty.

19
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:12,883
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Hello?

20
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:16,987
<i>What the hell is going on? I'm waiting to</i>
<i>hear about Marta and this Hermano guy.</i>

21
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,589
Yeah, I checked it out.
I do not think that she's cheating.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,363
- [Gob] I'm going over to Marta's.
- No, no, no. Don't do that, okay?

23
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,598
just lay low, be cool
and I'll talk to her again.

24
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:28,800
- That way you won't look so desperate, you know?
- You're a good guy, <i>mon frère.</i>

25
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,877
That means "brother" in French.

26
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:34,345
I don't know why I know that.
I took four years of Spanish.

27
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,643
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>So Michael went to speak with Marta...</i>

28
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,720
<i>about the misunderstanding</i>
<i>from the night before.</i>

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,653
- I owe you an apology.
- No, I owe you an apology.

30
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:46,386
I'm so ashamed that
I was so disrespectful to your brother.

31
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,894
Oh, who cares?
Nobody respects him.

32
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:52,625
You see, Marta, I have been interested
in you since the first day that we met.

33
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:56,134
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:58,535
It doesn't matter.

35
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:02,166
We live by a code, you and l...
to honor family.

36
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:06,940
Yes. That's one of the things that attracted
me to you... your sense of right and wrong.

37
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,312
I also like your hair
and your face and your breasts.

38
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,885
- You're so unlike your brother.
- Oh, thank you.

39
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:16,320
- Gob is like the cock of the walk. But not you.
- You are so kind.

40
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:19,985
- You're sensitive, like a woman.
- That's enough.

41
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:22,324
We do have to do
the right thing.

42
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,730
- And being together is the wrong thing.
- Very, very...

43
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,734
wrong.

44
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:41,174
?? [Gob Singing]

45
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:52,092
- Is that Gob?
- He likes to make love to this.

46
00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:55,560
- I'm gonna turn this off.
- Please.

47
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,829
Oh!

48
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:03,802
- Gob's wand.
- Oh, this... this is so wrong.

49
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:07,704
- Yes.
- No, no, no. Not-Not-Not... Not... Not hot wrong.

50
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:12,939
- You know, regular wrong. I gotta tell Gob.
- No, I have to tell him.

51
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:17,074
Yes, but you speak a little slowly, and I
really want to get this thing moving along.

52
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:20,381
So, listen, you do the noble thing, and you
tell him that you've met somebody else.

53
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:23,548
I'm gonna do the noble thing
and tell him that it's me.

54
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:26,717
While I'm doing my noble thing you could put
those photos in a box, get rid of the wand...

55
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:29,762
and we can do the wrong thing
the right way.

<i>[Narrator] And Maeby was getting tired</i>
<i>ofher parents'constant fighting.</i>

<i>Oh, great. And now you're mocking me,</i>

61
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:50,416
Hello, Maeby.

62
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:53,749
Nice cover. Why don't you two just get
a divorce and save us all a lot of grief?

63
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:58,314
<i>[Narrator] The night before, Tobias and Lindsay</i>
<i>had chosen to sleep in separate rooms...</i>

64
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:01,792
<i>and Tobias had dropped</i>
<i>an intriguing bit of information.</i>

65
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:04,865
And then, of course, we couldn't conceive,
so there was that famous ordeal.

66
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:07,627
- What do you mean, you couldn't conceive?
Was Maeby adopted?
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

67
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:10,795
Is she not really related to me?
Is she just some girl I know?

68
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:13,601
- <i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>George Michael never got an answer.</i>
- It's Carl Weathers.

69
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,505
<i>So he set about doing some</i>
<i>investigating on his own.</i>

70
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,046
- Hey, have you ever seen any
pictures of your mom pregnant?
- Don't talk to me about my mom.

71
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:22,308
She's crazy.
Both of them are.

72
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,442
- Sometimes I wish we weren't even related.
- <i>Hey, you know, maybe we're not.</i>

73
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:28,113
Because, I mean, when you think about it,
we don't even really look like each other.

74
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,952
No, I was talking
about my parents.

75
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:33,492
God, what's wrong
with this family?

76
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:37,255
Maybe we're not a family.

77
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:40,629
And maybe that's
very, very right. We...

78
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:45,433
Uncle Gob.
Hey, uh, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant?

79
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,306
- Oh, yeah. Dozens of times.
Hey, is your dad around, or...
- <i>[Door Shuts]</i>

80
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:57,006

- She sure has...

<i>four times,</i>

Oh, no? Why not?

83
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,717
- Because of you. You said to lay low.
And it's working.
- Great.

84
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:10,490
Tell you what, you may not be good with women,
but you are great with other people's women.

85
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,658
- I'll give you that.
- [Chuckles] No! Listen, Gob,
you can't just ignore her.

86
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,167
Maybe you <i>should</i> talk to her.
She is your girlfriend.

87
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,830
Exactly. And I want
to keep it that way.

88
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:23,569
<i>For all I know, she's calling to break up with me.</i>
<i>I don't answer the phone, that doesn't happen.</i>

<i>That's Italian for brother.</i>

90
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:31,346
Now all I gotta do
is find this Hermano guy.

91
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,852
- I'm gonna kill him.
- <i>[Buster] Hey, Brother.</i>

- <i>[Michael] Hey, Busty.</i>
- Hey, Brother.

93
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,720
- Hey, Buster.
- Gob, there's no need for violence.

94
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:42,194
<i>There never is. I'd like to think</i>
<i>that we're all intelligent, mature...</i>

95
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:44,958
adults that can settle
their differences...

96
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,932
whenever they might come to light,
through words.

97
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,265
Yeah, well, I let my fists
do the talking.

98
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:52,999
Not this one, 'cause obviously,
I need it for coin tricks and stuff.

99
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,201
- But this one, I let it speak for both of them.
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

100
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,007
Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball
and remain motionless when confronted.

101
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:02,446
That's what I did in high school
when I almost got into a fight.

102
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:06,041
- I think that was about being attacked by bears.
- Yeah, I know.

103
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:10,022
Hey, rich kid.
Gimme your lunch money.

104
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:16,553
But sometimes I wonder what it would be like
to get into a fight today.

105
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:20,657
- You'd be a much bigger ball.
- There is so much in life
that I have not experienced.

106
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:24,260
And now that I'm away from Mom,
I feel like this is my chance to live.

107
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:28,467
I want to dance. I want to make love
to a woman. I want to get a checking account.

108
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:31,510
[Laughs] I want to know what
it feels like to get my face socked in.

- Oh, hi, Mom.

112
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:43,118
- [Buster] I'm not here.
- Is that Buster? Tell him I'm fine without him.

113
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:46,624
Why haven't you called me back?
I'm worried about your father's hearing.

114
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:49,195
Mom, listen, it's gonna be fine.
I'm on it, okay? I'm taking care of it.

115
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:53,096

- It's tomorrow at 4:30.

116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,136
- Oh. I should write that down.
- Where is your head, Michael?

117
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:59,467
Everything's gonna be fine.
They just read the charges...

118
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,803
and we look like a loving family for,
like, six minutes.

119
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,844
- Ten minutes.
- We couldn't get that down, huh?

<i>went to speak with Tobias.</i>

- Oh, great! The rewrite.

122
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,278
Let's see if they've
beefed up my part.

123
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,617
I got three lines!

124
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:20,456
So, uh, I've been thinking about that, uh... that
conversation we were having the other night...

125
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,052
about, uh, where Maeby
came from, and, uh...

126
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,825
I was just wondering if
you could finish that thought.

127
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,458
Yes, okay.
Uh, well, have a seat.

128
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,470
Uh...

129
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:34,774
Um...

130
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:38,870
When a man...

131
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:44,508
needs to prove to a woman
that he's actually...

132
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:46,711
When a man loves a woman...

133
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,189
and he actually wants
to make love, uh, to her...

134
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,488
something very,
very special happens.

135
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,928
And, uh, with deep,
deep concentration...

136
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:02,366
- and-and great focus,
he's often able to achieve an erec...
- I'm sorry.

137
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,835
I'm gonna stop you.
I know where you're running.

138
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:07,202
l-I didn't mean
babies in general.

139
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:13,041
Oh, well, that's good,
'cause it was about to get a little, ick, gross.

140
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:16,742
- Yeah. No, I meant specifically with Maeby.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

141
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,750
- This isn't right.
- I know. You're right.

142
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,047
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It says it's a shower scene.

143
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:24,647
I'm not supposed to be in a shower scene.
It has nudity.

144
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:28,717
<i>[Narrator] Tobias was a never-nude,</i>
<i>which is exactly what it sounds like.</i>

145
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:32,663
I don't do nudity.
It says that right on my résumé. Okay?

146
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,257
What... What do you think
I wear these for?

147
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,769
I was never actually
clear on that.

148
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:40,897
So, you're, uh...
you're not with Marta anymore?

149
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:45,638
Well, my plan is to get her wanting me
but bad, and then I spring it on her.

150
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:49,375
I know you've been cheating on me,
and you just cost yourself one fine man...

151
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:54,147
- and one fine CD of him singing

- Well, I would never, uh...

152

still going out, but, uh...

153
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,723
if you're done with her,
I'd sure like a crack at her.

154
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:03,922
[Chuckling] Right, right.
That sounds great. Go for it, buddy.

155
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:06,966
But you know that she's kind of
used to being with me, right?

156
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:11,128
So, it'd be sort of like
going from prime rib to...

157
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:14,571
I don't know...
weird brother of prime rib.

158
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,644
- Do you even know her?
- I met her. I fell for her.

159
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:23,410
I've been watching her program, El Amor
Prohibido... <i>The Love That Is Forbidden.</i>

160
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,781
<i>She</i> is the love that's forbidden.

161

You know Hermano?

- Brother?

- <i>Hermano</i> means brother?
- Yeah.

166

167

- How the hell should I know, Buster?

172

You know, there is a guy who plays
her older brother on her show.

173
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:16,699

Thanks for the tip, Buster.

178

All right, Mom. I'll be sure to tell Buster.
Right. Bye. Mom wanted me to tell you...

179
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:35,546
that she doesn't care whether you live or die,
but if you're not dead...

180

tomorrow in the blue sweater.

181

- She said it would look nice with the gray pants.

- Damn it! She's right!
- Where's Gob?

183

- I think he's heading down to the set
of Marta's soap opera.
- What?

184
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,593
Get this: She may be cheating on him
with the guy who plays her brother.

185

I mean, I still like her,
but we're gonna have to deal with this.

- And I've got a blue sweater to steam.

00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:24,389
<i>Oh, good. We better get you</i>
<i>back in your cell.</i>

303
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:28,393
It's gettin' kind of crazy out there.

304
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:33,057
<i>[Narrator] Back at the model home, things</i>
<i>were heating up for Lindsay and Tobias as well.</i>

305
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,603
- <i>[Tobias] I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.</i>
- <i>[Lindsay] For me, Tobias.</i>

306
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,642
<i>That too.</i>

307
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,808
- <i>You did it.</i>
- Now what?

308
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,944
- Now this.
- <i>[Narrator] And for the first time in years...</i>

309
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:57,387
<i>Lindsay and Tobias became intimate.</i>

310
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,550
<i>The brothers'fight, meanwhile,</i>
<i>continued into the park...</i>

311
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,151
<i>with Buster still hoping</i>
<i>to take a punch.</i>

312
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,731
- [Gob] I'll kill you!
- [Buster] Oh, God!

313
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:08,266
- Go, go, go, go!
- <i>[Narrator] Lucille had decided that perhaps...</i>

314
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,098
<i>she was better off</i>
<i>without any of them.</i>

315
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:14,002
- Me! Me, me, me!
- Buster, get out of the way!

316
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:16,667
[Buster] Hit me in the face!
Hit me in the face! Hit me in the face!

317
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:18,971
- <i>Please! Hit me in the face!</i>
- No! Buster!

318
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,445
- Aah! Buster!
- <i>[Narrator] While Marta...</i>

319
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,416
<i>who'd been told the hearing would last</i>
<i>10 minutes, got tired of waiting.</i>

320
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,884
Hey! Hey!

321
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,649
- Marta.
- Marta.

322
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:35,091
What is wrong with you? I thought you were
good people. I thought you were noble.

323
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:38,130
I thought you cared about family,
but you clearly don't.

324
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:44,267
l-It's over.
Both of you. It's over.

325
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,429
Wait, wait.
What about, what about me?

326
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:48,939
I'm sorry.
I'm not totally sure who you are.

327
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:52,443
Wow! Wow.

328
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:55,013
That's what it feels like
to get punched in the face.

329
00:19:55,115 --> 00:20:00,212
- Can you believe that?
- Yeah, lecturing us about family.

330
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,312
I mean, who needs that?

331
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,653
And what are we doing?
Hey, we're brothers.

332
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,526
- That's gotta count for something.
- That counts for everything.

333
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,930
- I'm not gonna throw it away over some woman.
- Heh! Especially not my woman.

334
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:19,334
- Hmm?
- But you're right, you're right.
I mean, this is what's real.

335
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:24,376
- This is what lasts. Everything else is just petty.
- Yeah, totally beneath us.

336
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:27,344
- Yeah.
- And by the way, I don't know
how you call her your woman...

337
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:32,111
when she clearly prefers me, and she was
all prepared to be my girlfriend...

338
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:35,051
- calling me her boyfriend...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey!

339
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:38,022
- Hang on one second.
- This is all moot, because she
never got a chance to know me.

340
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:43,858
Now, will someone please have the decency
to punch me in the face?

341
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,403
Aah!

342
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:55,165
- Well, it's effective.
- Yeah, it really is.

343
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:58,672
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

344
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:00,939
- <i>Tobias quietly overcompensates.</i>
- [Yawning]

345
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:04,346
Please tell me
there's some coffee left.

346
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,317
[Groans]
Give me some.

347
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,947
I slept very well
last night.

1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,853
<i>Michael had snuck out
of work to see a British film...</i>

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,516
<i>with his British girlfriend, Rita.</i>

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,650
I hate it when they hire
Yanks to play Brits.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,353
You can always tell.

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,862
<i>When they came upon a toy store.</i>

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,957
We should get George Michael one
of these.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,968
Oh, no, that-that-that's
not really him.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,766
Besides, I already got him his
big present for his birthday.

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,534
A suit!
Dad, it's a Jack Welch.

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,940
I want you to look
under the pants.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,037
Quicken! Premier. Dad,
I hope you kept the receipt.

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,412
- You wanna return that?
- No, I wanna deduct it.

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,812
Come on, let's get him the train.

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,889
It's... Really, he would
only like it for the receipt.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,981
And this is crazy. I-I really...

20
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,992
I can't be seeing movies in the afternoon,
then going to toy stores.

21
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,994
I have to work. I'm not
even supposed to be here.

22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,293
<i>Michael couldn't
tear himself away.</i>

23
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,493
<i>- Could you?</i>
- I can't promise it'll be fun.

24
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,233
Okay, that's, uh,
that wa... that was fun.

25
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:21,541
Still, the land probably shouldn't have
given out beneath us.

26
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,582
But we got a mole problem.

27
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,583
A mole problem?

28
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,585
Yeah, they've undermined
this whole hill.

29
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,814
We won't be able to build on it
for a few months. But it's my fault.

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,017
This is exactly why I should have been coming
to work. The Japanese backers...

31
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,356
if they find out about this...
that we haven't started building...

32
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,659
- they might not come through with
their investments. - I won't tattle.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,928
I really fancy you.

34
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,026
I fancy you too.

35
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:48,096
<i>Michael was falling for Rita.</i>

36
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,803
- Whee!
<i>- And Rita was falling for Michael too.</i>

37
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,176
<i>But that wasn't part of the plan.</i>

38
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,715
Rita, you've dirt on your face.

39
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:02,015
- It's from school.
- I called the school, and you weren't there.

40
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,113
You know, we're here to learn
things, not fall in love.

41
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:08,820
So what if I have?
I've got feelings, all right?

42
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,125
I'm a woman too! Not some robot
you get to tell everything to.

43
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,633
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of it all!

44
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,363
Your instructions and your letters!

45
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,998
And your little missions.
And your stupid assignments.

46
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,407
"You do the math, Rita."
Well, no, you do the math.

47
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,707
- Oh, God.
- Do you remember this?

48
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,806
And the pledge that you made
when you were promised it?

49
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,148
- I said I'd do anything for it.
- I want him out of the picture.

50
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,688
- Can you do that?
- I'm a big girl.

51
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,021
<i>And Michael returned
home as well.</i>

52
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,828
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Oh, I got highlights.

53
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:53,133
- It'll blend in about a week.
- Here. Yeah, I actually meant the collapse.

54
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,335
It probably has something to do with
the 4,000 hair plugs I had in one sitting.

55
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,502
Well, maybe you oughta
see a doctor.

56
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,638
Yeah, but he's too busy going to the gym
to see his friend Frank.

57
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,718
Oh, we're more than friends.
I'm kind of his spotter.

58
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,017
Missed a spot. Anyway, we should be looking
at some big yen coming in from the Japanese.

59
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,423
And when it does, I'm taking
my gym buddy out to dinner.

60
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,461
I barely even know you.

61
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,896
- Who's Frank?
- I've been wanting to talk to you about that...

62
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,196
- but it's a little awkward.
- Oh, well.

63
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,635
I've been wanting to have
my own awkward talk as well.

64
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,265
I think we can be more
than just gym buddies.

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:35,007
- You're blowing my mind, Frank.
- I'm an agent, and I'd like to work with you.

66
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,309
Oh. Oh!

67
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,612
Well, that is great news.
Okay, good.

68
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,244
I'm so glad you went first.
Uh, uh what agency are you with?

69
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:48,157
<i>Frank said CIA, a government agency
that was responsible for this catastrophe.</i>

70
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:53,893
<i>But Tobias thought he said CAA, a talent
agency that was responsible for this one.</i>

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,128
Frank's in the business, Michael.
He's got a big project for me.

72
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,264
Says it's "top secret."
He kind of looks like you. Same size.

73
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,775
- Same curly hair.
- Tobias, maybe you should spend less time...

74
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,005
focused on your looks, and more time
focused on your daughter, okay?

75
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,378
Her grades are terrible.
She's gonna start getting F's.

76
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,474
<i>Actually, she'd
already gotten one...</i>

77
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:18,114
<i>as the movie she'd released in her secret
life as a studio executive was losing money.</i>

78
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,658
<i>But Maeby had a way to fix that.</i>

79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,092
- We turn it into a ride.
- A ride.

80
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,427
On the studio tour.
What used to be the Hell Tunnel...

81
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:30,628
now becomes the Tunnel
of <i>Love, Indubitably.</i>

82
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,138
- But didn't some people die in Hell Tunnel?
- That is an urban legend.

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,674
Two elderly people
got badly scalded...

84
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:41,213
when they tried to climb into the lava
cauldron, but I've got that covered.

85
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,282
Just like the poster!

86
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:47,114
Grades like those, she's gonna be taking
tickets at a movie theater the rest of her life.

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,383
You know what, you're one to talk.
You've completely ignored this family...

88
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,458
since that British bird
flew into your life.

89
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,927
No, I haven't. Well, maybe a little.
But, you know, she's amazing.

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,964
- You know, she was in the Olympics?
<i>- She wasn't.</i>

91
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,965
She's that Rita Leeds?

92
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,967
- Wasn't she on the cover of Newsweek?
<i>- No.</i>

93
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,470
- Yes.
<i>- Michael was thinking of this man.</i>

94
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,973
She even plays the banjo. Although,
I do have to spend more time at work.

95
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,237
I was at the property
the Japanese funded today.

96
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,643
The whole backside has moles.

97
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,841
That's Frank's problem too.

98
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,387
<i>Later that day, Michael went into
the office to find the rest of his family.</i>

99
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,389
Well, look who's finally gracing us
with his presence.

100
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,153
- What's the surrogate doing here?
- We're meeting with the lawyers.

101
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,525
So I've hired this guy
to be my eyes and ears.

102
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,758
<i>- You know, Dad, this guy costs us a fortune.</i>
- He's worth every penny.

103
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,494
- Hey, I didn't say that.
- Oh, Michael.

104
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,194
- Mr. Loblaw.
- I'll catch you up.

105
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,238
- The Japanese are coming.
- They are?

106
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,865
Somebody tipped them off that
the property wasn't ready for building.

107
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:47,002
Which it would have been if Michael hadn't
been so busy with his English muffin.

108
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,910
- Typical.
- Delicious.

109
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,245
- I need a drink.
- I'll take an English muffin.

110
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,115
We'll have to be honest
with these Japanese investors.

111
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,246
They, uh, come from a culture
that values honor and respect.

112
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,351
And Godzilla!

113
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,123
<i>- Godzirra!</i>
- Just sit down.

114
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,596
- Okay, guys.
<i>- Godzirra!</i>

115
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,764
This needs to stop now!

116
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,930
Okay, this is exactly what we shouldn't do
when they show up.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,031
Mom! That's enough.

118
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,610
- What? We're out of vodka.
- Sorry.

119
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,202
I thought you were doing Godzilla.

120
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,908
- Mom, that's enough.
- What? I'm laughing.

121
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,381
- Oh.
- Hey, maybe that's it.

122
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,283
Maybe we should do to the Japanese
what they do in their movies.

123
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,549
Build a miniature city.
Put it outside their window.

124
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,389
Tell them it's far away. It'll look real
if you squint. God knows they're squinters.

125
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:39,727
What do you think, Dad?
A whole... "Tiny Town."

126
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,233
- Another brilliant idea, Einstein.
- Really?

127
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:48,672
- You like to build it with me?
- Larry really never knows how to sell the sarcasm.

128
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,802
- It's a stupid idea.
- Uh. I'll build it with you, Gob.

129
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,313
Oh, great. That's another
brilliant idea, Steinberg.

130
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,510
I agree with Michael. If you take money
from these people under false pretenses...

131
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,519
you'll be committing fraud.

132
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,646
The government's already
watching your father closely.

133
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,987
They're going through his mail. They want
to put your father in prison for good.

134
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,584
Yeah, Bob's right. We've got to start
thinking practically.

135
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,062
Life is not some cheesy Japanese movie...

136
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,259
where the hero pulls on
a pair of jet pants and...

137
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,632
flies off the balcony like Astroboy.

138
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:23,039
And that's when George Sr. Did
a Web search for the words, "Jet pants."

139
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,441
- Even better.
- The bigger problem is, who alerted the Japanese?

140
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,276
I think you might have a spy.
This room, or someone in it...

141
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,441
might even be wired
with a listening device.

142
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,389
You need to find
that leak and plug it.

143
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,890
Your father said that he was
set up by a British syndicate.

144
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,960
Maybe you should look
for somebody English.

145
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,497
What?

146
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,692
I think Michael's
already plugged our leak.

147
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,634
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You've been spending a lot of time with Rita.

148
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,706
- And she's "Britishish."
- She's a spy.

149
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,607
- I haven't told Rita anything.
<i>- This was not strictly true.</i>

150
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,077
Let's start with
my family's misdemeanors...

151
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,648
and then push right on through
to the lighter treasons.

152
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,718
The Japanese backers... if they find out
that we haven't started building...

153
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,980
they might not come through
with their investments.

154
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:13,081
Then he siphoned off the entire pension
fund into a dummy corporation...

155
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,218
filed for bankruptcy, and used...
Do you know any other songs?

156
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,389
- She's a spy!
- Rita is not a spy, okay?

157
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,558
She's a beautiful, elegant woman.
It doesn't make any sense.

158
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,500
- What doesn't make any sense
is why she's dating you.
- No, that's a good point.

159
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,540
Actually, my sources tell me that
the leak goes by the name "Mr. F."

160
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,201
Ah, <i>Mister</i> F. Rita's not a man.

161
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,074
- As far as you know.
- And it could be an alias.

162
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,616
<i>- Alias</i> is a show about a spy!
- All right, that's it!

163
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,743
I finally find someone that I really care about,
my family tries to drive us apart.

164
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,845
It's not gonna work. So you know what?
I got a switch for you.

165
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:48,188
You guys handle this problem.
I am gonna go have some fun.

166
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,695
Unbelievable. Deserting the family
when we most need him.

167
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,425
- Shameful.
- Gob, I'm sending you a package.

168
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,025
You'll know what to do with it.

169
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,627
<i>Michael was upset, and he called Rita.</i>

170
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,539
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, I've been thinking.</i>

171
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,670
I'm going to start working less,
and I do want to start having more fun.

172
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,975
So, I'd like to
take you out tomorrow.

173
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,448
<i>All day, anywhere you want.
What do you say?</i>

174
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,044
<i>Hell Tunnel takes another name.
Will it take another life?</i>

175
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,056
Oh, I say yes.

176
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,649
Only, I'm going
to take you out.

177
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,025
<i>The next morning, Michael
was heading out for his day with Rita.</i>

178
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,104
- George Michael.
- Hey, I love my present, Dad.

179
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,139
- I'd wear it to school, but who needs
a Welch wedge, right? - Yeah.

180
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,675
- That's when they... - Enough business.
In fact, I got you another present.

181
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,405
It's something I saw yesterday
when I was out with Rita.

182
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,845
- It's time for us to start having some fun.
- I don't know.

183
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,144
"Fun" and "Failure"
both start out the same way.

184
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,519
Let's just go ahead
and rip this down, huh?

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,421
<i>And Larry, the surrogate...</i>

186
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,863
<i>showed up to pick up the jet pack that
George Sr. Had sent to the model home.</i>

187
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,629
What is that, a train set?
Look down, Larry.

188
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,297
- No, not down at your feet.
- Left.

189
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,432
- My left, your right.
- What is the matter with this guy?

190
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,273
- And, let me guess, he's probably...
- saying all that too.

191
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,975
It is a train set!
Those Japanese sites.

192
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,310
- I'm never gonna find my way...
- past that hallway sensor.

193
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,516
Dad, what are you doing here?
Is this the package you sent me?

194
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,289
<i>Tiny Town. This is for
Tiny Town, isn't it?</i>

195
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,957
<i>You did like my idea,
didn't you, Dad?</i>

196
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,057
<i>I think he's in the can.</i>

197
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,568
<i>Actually, George Sr. was in the kitchen...</i>

198
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,232
<i>trying to soothe himself
with an ice cream sandwich.</i>

199
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,648
<i>And that's when he discovered a way
to possibly slip by the sensors.</i>

200
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,014
If mother sees this,
she will blow a cow.

201
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,090
- Uh-oh.
- Dad?

202
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,658
- Oh, cool, a train set.
- Oh, I've always wanted one of those.

203
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,064
<i>Maybe we could build
our Tiny Town together.</i>

204
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,363
<i>Do you want to, Dad?</i>

205
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,938
<i>Buster had always wanted
to do the same with Gob.</i>

206
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,373
Goody! Yeah.
I do want to.

207
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,910
Yea. I do want to. Goody.

208
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,948
<i>Gob was thrilled,
as was Buster.</i>

209
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,612
<i>Only Larry was disappointed. But he was
such a pro you'd never know it.</i>

210
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:33,749
<i>And back at the gym, Tobias was finding out
more about the project the agent had suggested.</i>

211
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,851
Come on! What are you gonna tell me?
What've you got for me?

212
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,363
The Japanese investors you told us about
are going over to your place today.

213
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,594
I need you there when they are.
We need you to be a mole.

214
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,002
Oh.
Kind of a backer's audition.

215
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,404
Okay, I get it.
All right. Well then, Frank...

216
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,911
I shall be a bigger, hairier mole than
the one on your inner left thigh.

217
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,973
<i>And later, Michael and Rita were
on the Tantamount Studios tour.</i>

218
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,054
The thing she doesn't understand about
bovine spongiform encephalitis is...

219
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,588
Hold! Hold! The tram. Let's get
out of here, folks! Make some room!

220
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,557
- Make some room!
- Look! It's <i>Malcolm in the Middle!</i>

221
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,288
In the middle of shooting, I guess.

222
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,560
Oh, that's okay. It's more important to show
how we make the show than actually make it.

223
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,069
!@%$# Tantamount.

224
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,434
- Hello?
<i>- They dropped off the package you sent...</i>

225
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,439
<i>but I don't think
I'm old enough for it.</i>

226
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,409
Of course you are. I want you to have
a little fun. You're not gonna break anything.

227
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,948
<i>But of course, Michael
thought he was talking about the train set.</i>

228
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:34,645
<i>Not the extremely dangerous jet pack
the boy had just found at the front door.</i>

229
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,086
- Well, what if I crash it?
- That's half the fun.

230
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:43,955
<i>And soon the tour arrived at the
Tunnel of</i> Love, Indubitably.

231
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,294
<i>So take the hand of someone you love...</i>

232
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,596
<i>as we enter the Tunnel of</i> Love, Indubitably.

233
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,933
<i>...nnel of Hell.</i>

234
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,304
<i>But Michael was happy
to hold the hand of someone he did love.</i>

235
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,775
<i>And then,
he noticed her bracelet.</i>

236
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,547
<i>Michael had just noticed that
Rita was wearing a suspicious bracelet.</i>

237
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,058
- What does your bracelet say?
- Nothing.

238
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,892
Oh, look. Look, there they are
on the bicycle made for two.

239
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,694
It says Mr. F, doesn't it?
Who is he?

240
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,133
Nobody.
I can't tell you!

241
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,228
Oh, God. He followed us.

242
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,967
<i>- But why?</i>
- Wait a minute. You know that man?

243
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,805
It's not what you think it is.
It's my uncle.

244
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,311
Is that Mr. F?
What does he want?

245
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,313
He wants you out of the picture.

246
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,645
- Bloody right I do.
- H-Hey!

247
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,847
- Oh!
- You lied to me, Rita!

248
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,480
You made me turn against my family.
But it's over now.

249
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,223
Oh! Me!@%s are wet.

250
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,399
<i>And Maeby received a call about
the latest lava cauldron accident.</i>

251
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,662
Already?
It's only been an hour.

252
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,001
I'm gonna lose this job. Maybe
I should let Mort take me out to dinner.

253
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,870
- Maeby?
- Okay, I'm definitely gonna lose this job.

254
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,342
- I can explain.
- Rita set me up. She set us all up.

255
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,676
This beautiful, funny, brilliant woman
was a spy. Everybody was right.

256
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,410
It was too good to be true.
And I... am turning her in.

257
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,386
Let me tell you something else. I would not
want to be the next woman who tries to fool me.

258
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,185
Well, that was a freebie.

259
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,922
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was trying to solve a mystery of his own.</i>

260
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,930
<i>The jet pack...</i>

261
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:32,368
<i>had come with an instructional DVD
that seemed to confuse more than clarify.</i>

262
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,931
<i>What was clear was that
the gift was extremely dangerous.</i>

263
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:49,017
<i>And it did seem like a lot of work...</i>

264
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,954
<i>for a little payoff.</i>

265
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,752
- Have fun!
- Have fun.

266
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,590
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was bonding with the man
he thought his father was controlling.</i>

267
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,632
- Almost done with the water tower.
- Neat-o.

268
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:06,228
<i>His real father, however,
had gotten lost within the walls.</i>

269
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,238
Where the hell am I?

270
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,776
<i>He was actually somewhere between
the linen closet and the guest room.</i>

271
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,072
<i>I'm really glad that we're doing this together.</i>

272
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,639
<i>- I've never felt so close to you.</i>
- Oh! I feel the same way.

273
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,187
- He's crying now.
- Oh, God, look at us.

274
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,018
<i>We're like a couple of girls
on the last day of camp.</i>

275
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:33,192
<i>Right outside the house, Tobias was working
with the man he thought was a talent agent.</i>

276
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,132
- You ready?
- Oh, yes. I'm gonna be a great mole.

277
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,170
Check, two, three.
"Let Lilly lick Lionel's lusty leathers.

278
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,432
- Let Lilly lick Lionel's"...
- The levels are fine.

279
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,269
- All right.
- Remember, no one can know it's you.

280
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,141
- We need to capture George Sr.
- Capture George Sr?

281
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,613
- What... Is that what you hired me to do?
- You didn't realize that?

282
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,210
No. But it does make perfect sense.
I have played him before.

283
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,951
<i>He had, in the poorly narrated
reality series,</i> Scandalmakers.

284
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,959
It's gonna be tough to work
that into the character...

285
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,029
and it's going to fight
the costume I rented...

286
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,895
but I didn't take six weeks of improv
classes at the Groundlings for nothing.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,300
<i>Michael was on the phone to Bob Loblaw.</i>

288
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,338
I don't even think
she's here legally, all right?

289
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,466
She's taken advantage of me.
I-I want you to take care of this.

290
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,976
<i>Call the CIA, do whatever you have to do.</i>

291
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,139
Fine, but you take care of your family.
I think they're going ahead with this hoax.

292
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,513
And if money changes hands,
you're all going to jail.

293
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,645
Well, unfortunately the roads are out, so we
can't take you up there to see it in person...

294
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,725
but if you stand absolutely
still right there...

295
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,387
and just squint in-into the light,
and behold, Sudden Hill!

296
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,158
Gob! Don't!

297
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,167
<i>It actually looked pretty
good. Even the financiers thought so.</i>

298
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,399
<i>Ishiro said, "I am reassured.
And they treat us with respect this time."

299
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,069
<i>Motoyoshi said, "I thought the woman
was pretending as a monster...</i>

300
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,009
<i>but she was
just out of vodka."

301
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,675
Let's go ahead and close the curtains, and
not accept any money while we're ahead.

302
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:03,153
So, as you can see, any rumor of
a mole problem is completely untrue.

303
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,715
<i>But, unfortunately, this was just as Tobias
appeared in his rented mole outfit.</i>

304
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,522
- I'm a mole!
- Not the village!

305
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,427
Families can come... Ow! Ow!

306
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,866
<i>- I'm very particular about building codes.</i>
- The water tower.

307
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,201
And this water tower
does not pass muster.

308
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,864
- Lucille!
- Who can save our village?

309
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,376
- Michael!
<i>- As it turned out, it was George Michael...</i>

310
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,379
<i>who had finally gotten
his grandfather's jet pack to work.</i>

311
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,045
Hard to breathe in this thing. It's
really hot. I'm sweating all over myself.

312
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,623
I can't stop this thing!

313
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,956
- You're blowing my audition!
<i>- I ache with embarrassment.</i>

314
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,563
<i>The Japanese were never
to be heard from again.</i>

315
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,158
Okay, what's going on here?

316
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,229
Okay, that's no surprise.
George Michael?

317
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,740
Dad, I-I'm sorry. I can't
fly it very well, all right?

318
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,743
I think I would
rather have the Welch.

319
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,679
I didn't buy you that. I bought you
the train set, which you guys just destroyed.

320
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,012
Did you keep the receipt?

321
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,054
<i>- What is that?</i>
- It's feedback. <i>Is someone else wired?</i>

322
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,147
<i>Oh, that's me.</i>
My friend Frank wired me.

323
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,783
- He wanted me to be a mole.
- Our cover's blown.

324
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,421
Let's get out of here.

325
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,692
Good-bye, Tobias.

326
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,928
He wanted you to be a mole?

327
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,335
Oh, my God. Tobias Fünke.

328
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,773
You're Mr. F. Which means that man
was Rita's uncle. What have I done?

329
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,778
- I have to get this suit back.
- They destroyed our town.

330
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,781
- But they can't take away our memories.
- Oh! I've had...

331
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,785
- the time of my life.
<i>- I think he's being sarcastic, Gob.</i>

332
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,345
No, I'm not, Mother.
I mean lover.

333
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,982
- I like making love to Mother.
- I mean lover!

334
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,221
<i>- Oh, my God. Buster, is that you?</i>
- Yes.

335
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,629
Gob, it's just I wanted
to spend some time with you.

336
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,793
That's all. And you enjoyed it.
You can't deny that.

337
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,895
<i>I guess you're right.</i>

338
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,837
<i>Maybe we should spend
more time together.</i>

339
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,707
- Oh, I'd really like that.
<i>- It's weird.</i>

340
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:11,146
<i>It took some idiot parrot man with
a camera in his hat to bring us together.</i>

341
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,652
<i>But even a pro
like Larry has a breaking point.</i>

342
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,451
Rita.

343
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,994
- What do you want? I have to pack.
- Pack? Where are you going?

344
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,223
- Someone called the bobbies on us.
- No, no.

345
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,993
- My uncle and I have to go back to big Britain.
- Oh, that was me, Rita.

346
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,161
I am so, so sorry. I didn't
know what was going on.

347
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,330
Why did your uncle
threaten me?

348
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,066
He thought
you might be trouble.

349
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:41,078
- That was actually very astute of him.
- Good-bye, Michael.

350
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,946
You know, I really did fancy you.
I can't stay here now.

351
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,678
- Marry me.
- What?

352
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,777
Let me marry you.

353
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,688
You can get a green card, you-you can stay
and we can just see if this works, you know?

354
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,158
It sounds crazy, but this
will give us a chance...

355
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,719
to get away from both of our families
and see if this works.

356
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,562
Might be fun.

357
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:07,195
- Really?
- Yes.

358
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,275
Yes, yes, yes!

359
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,334
But let's go right now, okay? Before my uncle
gets out of the shower for some more cigarettes.

360
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,471
You take that,
I gotta leave a note.

361
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,419
<i>But there was one piece of
intelligence that Michael didn't have.</i>

362
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:31,895
- Interesting.
- Don't even think about it, Jay. She's an MRF.

363
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,831
- MRF? What's that?
- Mentally retarded female.

364
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,927
- That explains what she's doing with him.
- And the hats.

365
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,341
Oh, my God!
She's gonna marry him.

366
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,176
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

367
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:56,016
<i>George Sr., disoriented in the walls,
almost makes contact with a new mole.</i>

368
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,188
<i>Not that one. Wait for it.</i>

369
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,529
<i>And Michael and Rita
start a new life together.</i>

370
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,865
- What's that?
- A prize.

371
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,734
A lovely, lovely prize.

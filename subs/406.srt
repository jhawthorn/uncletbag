2
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:15,480
NARRATOR: George Sr. had come
to a political fund-raiser

3
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:18,274
to get support
for a wall project...

4
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,151
LUCILLE: To separate
the U.S. and Mexico.

5
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:21,820
NARRATOR:...that some
considered insensitive...

6
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:23,655
- Which was my idea!
- Was your idea.

7
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:26,491
- NARRATOR:...even though he himself...
- Oh. Tender.

8
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,493
was feeling more sensitive
by the day.

9
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:29,995
Curious feeling.

10
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:32,163
But he tried to muster
the old self-confidence

11
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,999
for his face time
with Herbert Love.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,543
GEORGE SR.: And I-I just think
there will be a lot of support

13
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:39,420
flowing in this relationship,
and your base...

14
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:41,214
You got a point
behind all those teeth of yours?

15
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:42,966
(laughs)
If you support the wall,

16
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,509
I'll give you
a piece of the action.

17
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:46,511
- Action? Action Jackson?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,680
- Yes, sir.
- What do I look like, Carl Weathers to you?

19
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,016
- Oh, no, no.
- NARRATOR: Not at all.

20
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:53,058
- No.
- This, of course, is Herbert Love.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,477
My name is Herbert Love,
and I want you

22
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,062
to say "high-low"
to my low-high plan.

23
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:57,856
A candidate
whose campaign slogan

24
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:01,192
was embraced by everyone
from the very wealthy...

25
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,777
And who doesn't want
a high income?

26
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,030
...to their bankers
and tax attorneys.

27
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,949
High-low, high-low,
it's off to work I go--for you.

28
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,075
My name is Herbert Love,

29
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:11,244
and I most definitely
approve this message.

30
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:14,414
Do I look like someone
who eats at CW Swappigans?

31
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:15,832
See, I stand for three things:

32
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:18,459
one, getting
Barack Hussein Obama

33
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,546
Wama Comma Mama on a Llama
out of office...

34
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,840
It's a crazy-town name.

35
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,550
Two, low taxes
for high income earners.

36
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:26,718
That's my low-high plan.

37
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,012
- I know it.
- And three,

38
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,847
getting a little something
in my slushie fund

39
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:32,432
so that I'm nice and loose

40
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:34,308
and can help make
numbers one and two happen.

41
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,102
I don't want to be the one to
say it, but I happen to be fond

42
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:39,188
of redheads and greenbacks.

43
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,774
- NARRATOR: George Sr. had neither.
- Oh, I-I...

44
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:42,567
- How would you like both?
- Get it for me tonight,

45
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:43,985
and I'll make your wall thing

46
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:45,486
the third point
of my three-point plan.

47
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:47,238
All I got right now is:
"You want to reach

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,991
"your hand into my pocket
to pay for your birth control?

49
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:53,036
I get to put my hand
in your pocket to put it in."

50
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,080
But when unveiled it
in Garden Grove,

51
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,331
I had to duck a
woman's pump and a mini pizza.

52
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,166
Oops.

53
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,710
NARRATOR:
Coming up with money, however,

54
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,629
would be difficult
for George Sr.,

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,214
who hadn't been acting
like his old self--

56
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,591
something his twin brother
Oscar had done

57
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,010
- You know, the wall.
- much more successfully

58
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,511
earlier that day,
when, in retribution...

59
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:11,972
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven?

60
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,640
...to a brother
who lied to him...

61
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:14,891
So he only did buy that land
for personal gain.

62
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,768
Well... Oscar.

63
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,490
- (chuckles) Oscar.
- ...Oscar chose to lie

64
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,147
- with George's wife.
- Call me Father B.

65
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:25,110
And, although too explicit
for an American audience,

66
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:28,029
the lovemaking was intense
and beautiful

67
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:29,990
but for one small
misunderstanding

68
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,867
that occurred
during the afterglow.

69
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,703
No. I-I mean...

70
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:37,288
it's good to be out of that

71
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,999
sweaty old hot box
at the compound.

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,334
No, this was am...
this was amazing.

73
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,003
NARRATOR: And Oscar finally got
more information

74
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:44,629
- Speaking of that...
- about his brother's plans.

75
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,548
...we may need to have
a president ready to go

76
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,550
if something should happen
to Lucille 2

77
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,302
while we're building the wall.

78
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,220
So we are building a wall.

79
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:54,764
Right where Oscar

80
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,058
thought he would be spending
the rest of his life.

81
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,643
(Lucille laughs)

82
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:01,062
Turn him around three times
and put him in Fullerton,

83
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:02,730
- he won't know the difference.
- Fullerton.

84
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:06,400
You know, I think we should
send our son down there.

85
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:09,445
Give him some training,
show that he has a job,

86
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:10,655
let him sweat a little.

87
00:03:10,697 --> 00:03:11,781
Buster? No, no.

88
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,158
I won't... I won't hear of it.

89
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:14,408
It could kill him.

90
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,036
I meant Gob.

91
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,537
Oh. Oh, fine.

92
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:20,205
Yeah, send him down.
I love that.

93
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,916
NARRATOR:
Now the story of a family

94
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,502
whose future
was abruptly canceled

95
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,754
and the one father
who had no choice

96
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,049
but to keep himself together.

97
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:35,138
It's George Sr.'s...

98
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:41,102
Unaware that he was being
cuckolded by his brother,

99
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:42,520
George Sr. was struggling

100
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:44,939
to find money
to bribe Herbert Love.

101
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,315
Didn't someone die
in one of these things?

102
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:48,026
Oh, no, not in one of ours.

103
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,403
Although his pitch had lost
some of its luster.

104
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:53,364
And, you know, I mean, it's
better than dying in the snow.

105
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,076
I mean, not...
not-not that you'll die,

106
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:59,037
but if you had to choose,
uh, I mean...

107
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,997
- Brr, you know?
- Hmm.

108
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,749
Well, I'll think about it.

109
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,417
Would you like a mini-quiche?

110
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,086
Oh, I'm so sorry.

111
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:09,630
I thought you were a successful
Republican strategist.

112
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:11,799
- I'm so sorry.
- Why, 'cause I'm black?

113
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,426
Oh, no...

114
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,344
NARRATOR:
It was over.

115
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,597
But at least
he could go home...

116
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:18,973
Cindy's going to love these.

117
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,767
Excuse me, Red,
you're not the only one

118
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,144
- who likes coconut shrimp.
- ...with some coconut shrimp.

119
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,771
(laughs) Well, I should have
known you'd be here,

120
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,565
supporting this right-wing,
dangerous crackpot.

121
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:30,902
Lindsay, I forgot--
you dyed your hair.

122
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,862
What are you doing here?

123
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,488
I'm supporting Love, as well.

124
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,199
We're both doing that.

125
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,534
Oh, honey, I-I've wanted
to contact you

126
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:41,412
every single day since last May.

127
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:43,456
I haven't seen you
since January.

128
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:46,960
Yeah, the first four months,
I was in denial. How are you?

129
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,294
Are... are you good?

130
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,088
Do you have any money?

131
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,756
Not really.

132
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:53,299
- Oh.
- Oh, except for

133
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,176
a $50, 000 check

134
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:58,054
your wife sent to my daughter
for plastic surgery.

135
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,556
What kind of a woman does that?

136
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,809
I thought there
was no money left.

137
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,102
Oh, no. Oh, no.

138
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,603
Oh, that's awful.

139
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,772
I mean, she's just precious
the way she is.

140
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,941
Does Maisie even know
about this?

141
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,192
No, thank God.

142
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,860
And her name is Maeby.

143
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,404
You don't think Maisie's cuter?

144
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:18,074
You know what I want to do?
I want to take this,

145
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:20,952
and I want to deposit it
in a trust fund

146
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:24,747
that she can't open
until she's 21.

147
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,708
- I guess I can't use it anyway.
- Are you kidding me?

148
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,378
You are the most beautiful
little girl I know.

149
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,630
And if you have any more work,

150
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:33,965
your cartilage
is going to collapse.

151
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,424
Let me see if I can...

152
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:37,218
- There you go.
- NARRATOR: And that's when

153
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,679
George Sr. finally tipped
a black man.

154
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,805
- Got the check.
- HERBERT: ...okay?

155
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:41,806
Ooh! Hey, you got the check.

156
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:42,849
Third party.

157
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,558
Oh, man.

158
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,771
- I am going to put this on my wall.
- Oh...

159
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:51,607
NARRATOR: George Sr.
left the hotelhoping he'd

160
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,653
- accomplished something.
- (thunder rumbling)

161
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:57,738
And on the news the next day...

162
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,282
HERBERT:
We have got...

163
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:03,494
to build a wall
between us and Mexico.

164
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,121
NARRATOR:
...he found out he had.

165
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,873
- (laughs) Yes!
- And aside from hating

166
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:09,125
the wrinkles he saw
in the rearview mirror

167
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,962
around his eyes and brow,
George Sr. was happy.

168
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:15,340
♪ All you need is smiles ♪

169
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:19,593
♪ Lots and lots
of smiley smiles ♪

170
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:20,845
♪ All you need is... ♪

171
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,973
What the (bleep)
is he smiling about?

172
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:25,516
Hello!

173
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,227
Oh, we're just doing a survey

174
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:28,519
for the U.S. government, ma'am.

175
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,813
(laughing):
Oh, no, I-I'm a man.

176
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:33,482
I was just wearing,
uh, this blouse

177
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:36,361
because I was, uh, driving
and I hate my arms.

178
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:37,778
What's the tape for?

179
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,239
Laying out border coordinates

180
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,907
for when they put up the wall.

181
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,284
Shh! You're not supposed
to tell them what it's for.

182
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:44,827
Well, he already
mentioned the tape,

183
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,120
and he looks American.

184
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,164
- Yeah, but he's in Mexico.
- Wait.

185
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,957
Guys, no, no, Mexico starts

186
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,876
- back there, by the gully.
- Whoever told you that's

187
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,961
probably chomping on the maca,
if you know what I mean.

188
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,504
So, what you're saying
to me is that

189
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:58,091
on this side of the tape,
I'm in Mexico,

190
00:06:58,132 --> 00:06:59,842
but when I come over here...

191
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:02,262
Whoa. We're going to need
to see a passport, sir.

192
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,180
Pasaporte.

193
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:06,182
NARRATOR: George Sr.
liked to make men

194
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:08,475
who disappoint him suffer.

195
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:10,228
But things change.

196
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,688
You really hurt
my feelings, guys.

197
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,316
- No hugging... ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

198
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:18,361
(George Sr. sobbing)

199
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,655
NARRATOR: George Sr.
had just discovered

200
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:23,866
that the millions of dollars
of American property

201
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:26,244
he owned was worthless.

202
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:27,620
How did you not notice?

203
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,122
You saw all the papers.

204
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:30,748
NARRATOR:
And in Mexico.

205
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,293
You can't expect me to read
every page of that deal.

206
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,054
Besides, that one
was particularly difficult

207
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,796
because it was all in Spanish.

208
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,923
It says very clearly,
on my business card,

209
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:41,342
"Se habla español."

210
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:42,843
"I do not speak Spanish."

211
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:44,045
And it was your brother Oscar

212
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:45,763
who told me it
was on the border.

213
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:47,432
How did he not know?

214
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:49,600
NARRATOR: Unfortunately,
Oscar missed the signs.

215
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,602
You think it's okay
to burn these?

216
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:52,979
OSCAR:
Well, this is America.

217
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,730
If they don't want us
to burn signs,

218
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,774
they shouldn't write them
in Spanish.

219
00:07:56,816 --> 00:08:00,694
- Everybody!
- ♪ Sign, sign, everywhere a sign... ♪

220
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,863
NARRATOR:
Only Heartfire knew the truth.

221
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:06,700
But the singing was so loud,
no one could hear her thoughts.

222
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,786
I bribed Love

223
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:11,080
to push for the building
of the wall,

224
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,040
and I don't have the land
to build it on!

225
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:14,834
BARRY: Shh, shh, shh.
Call Herbert Love, all right?

226
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,836
Tell him you would
greatly appreciate it

227
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:19,422
if he'd rescind his support
for the wall.

228
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,507
And make him a flip-flopper?
I can't do that.

229
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:22,967
NARRATOR:
Actually, he'd tried,

230
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,551
but couldn't afford it.

231
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,720
It's a 40 for the flip
and a 40 for the flop,

232
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:29,474
and since it's going to cause
a flap, I'd say another 40.

233
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:33,186
So it's a flat 40-40-40
flip-flop and a flap fee.

234
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,896
Well, then find someone
who has influence with him.

235
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,440
Hold on.
A client is, uh, coming,

236
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,983
and I don't know where Oscar is.

237
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:40,234
He's disappeared.

238
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:42,320
And there is something up
with him

239
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:44,405
because he is scary now.

240
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:45,656
He has changed.

241
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,533
Hey, you've changed,
you big (bleep).

242
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,202
You're acting
like a little girl lately.

243
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:50,495
And not in the good way.

244
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:52,056
Pull yourself together.
Act like a man.

245
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,498
GEORGE SR.:
You're right, you're right.

246
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:56,501
- Okay, love you.
- Love you, too. Bye.

247
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,127
Cash, no receipt.

248
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,920
- Hot day, Father.
- Hot day, Father B.

249
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,964
- Hot day.
- Hot day, Father.

250
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,008
Hello, Father.

251
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,343
Don't call me that!

252
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:06,719
What are you doing here?

253
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,762
- You and Mom talked about it.
- We did...?

254
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,890
Oscar.

255
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:13,851
NARRATOR: In fact, it was Oscar
who spoke to Lucille

256
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:17,646
about hiring Gob, but not
before an ominous warning.

257
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:20,316
But, you know,
he has magical abilities.

258
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,944
He can handle a lot more
than we give him credit for.

259
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:26,531
I know... What?!

260
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,699
I would have been here sooner,
but I had to go down

261
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,326
to San Diego
and loop my way back up

262
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,036
because they put up
that border ribbon.

263
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:33,538
- Which is totally new,
- Shh!

264
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,122
and I wasn't expecting it;
it's fine.

265
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:37,166
Anyway, Father,
you've got to get me a job

266
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,876
so I can be prepared...
to be president.

267
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,003
All right, you got to keep this
"father" stuff to yourself.

268
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:43,548
I can't have these people think
that I raised a limo driver.

269
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,258
I'm not a limo driver.

270
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:46,926
I'm a gentleman honey farmer.

271
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,011
The only thing I've got
back there are my bees.

272
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,346
- Beans?
- No, bees!

273
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,181
- Bees?
- Bees!

274
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,225
Bees! Oh, bees!

275
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,102
The boxes fell over
on the way here

276
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,686
when I had to swerve
to avoid an ostrich.

277
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,480
You got to do something
about this--these people

278
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:00,773
paid a lot of money.
Do something!

279
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:01,941
No, they won't listen to me.

280
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:03,692
- They've all got CCD.
- CCD?

281
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:04,944
Colony collapse disorder.

282
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:06,779
The guy sold me
just really sick bees.

283
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,573
Don't worry.
Dad, they're going to hive.

284
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:09,907
They always hive.

285
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,658
NARRATOR:
Usually by seeking out

286
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,536
a structure
that most resembles a hive.

287
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:16,747
Bees! Wonderful bees!

288
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,791
GEORGE SR.: It's okay.
It's okay. Gob, get in there

289
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,626
- and get them out!
- GOB: Okay, I'm on it.

290
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,420
NARRATOR: But then George Sr.
got some more bad news.

291
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,922
OSCAR: Hello, brother.
Thought I'd find you

292
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:26,466
in a blouse and a beekeeper hat.

293
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:27,925
What are you doing here?
No, no, no, no, no.

294
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,676
We cannot be seen
next to each other.

295
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:31,929
I'm Dr. Norman!

296
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:33,222
Well, if you don't want
to be seen, then you

297
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,682
go in the sweat lodge.
You owe me.

298
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,060
Is that a fact?
Listen, you told me

299
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,020
the property was on the border.

300
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:42,940
It is 50 feet south
of the border, Oscar.

301
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:46,652
Well, excuse me, but they hadn't
put up the tape yet.

302
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,071
So I was going off Buster's map.

303
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:51,073
Oh, God, it was Buster's map.

304
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,866
NARRATOR:
Buster had indeed made the map,

305
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:54,619
as a cartography student,

306
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,246
because the class where you get
to see naked people,

307
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:00,207
and draw them, was full.

308
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,708
And you lied to me.

309
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,794
You told me you bought
this property to live on.

310
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:07,590
No, you bought this property
to put up a wall.

311
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,175
I told one lie,

312
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,302
but I-I was going to share
the money with you.

313
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,970
- Two lies.
- And why do I think

314
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:16,182
that you charge more than
five dollars for lemonade?

315
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:17,891
Three small lies.

316
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,186
Now, will you do me a favor,
just get in the tent.

317
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,562
Gob's getting rid of the bees,

318
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,105
and we'll push the matinee
till 3:00.

319
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:25,483
No, I'm sick and tired
of being in that hut

320
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,026
pretending to be you.

321
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,737
Maybe I should go out there
and pretend to be you.

322
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,031
So, good-bye, George.

323
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,658
This is the last
you'll see of me.

324
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:37,328
Just gonna use the can
for one second.

325
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,830
CHINA GARDEN:
There's two Dr. Normans!

326
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,628
NARRATOR: George Sr. headed up
north to see his wife

327
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,297
before his brother could,
but he soon found out

328
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,090
he was too late by a day.

329
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:51,842
LUCILLE (over speakerphone):
Oh, I know what you're coming up

330
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:53,427
- to do to me.
- Right.

331
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,637
What?

332
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,389
LUCILLE:
Yesterday, you were amazing.

333
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,849
Georgie, I can't stop
thinking about it.

334
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:01,143
You haven't been
like that in years.

335
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,936
GEORGE SR.:
Oh, right.

336
00:12:02,978 --> 00:12:05,147
- You mean, slow-witted?
- I hope you're ready

337
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,483
for more of the same today.

338
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,151
(growls playfully)

339
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:11,445
Uh... (sighs) Oh, God.

340
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:12,988
George Sr. had a few problems:

341
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,781
his brother was
sleeping with his wife,

342
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,367
the property he was going to
sell to the government...

343
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:17,910
(Lucille whispering)

344
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,870
to build the U.S. wall on
was in Mexico...

345
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:21,664
GEORGE SR.: All right...
all right...

346
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:22,915
...and his sweat lodge colony
had just collapsed.

347
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,458
Okay.

348
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,252
So he had to deal with
first things first.

349
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,713
GEORGE SR.:
If my identical twin brother

350
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,257
can get it up, then shouldn't I?

351
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,509
Have you had any sexual feeling
at all lately?

352
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,135
No!

353
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:37,338
You know, the Hopi Indians
believe that this spot here,

354
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:38,889
- Okay.
- when manipulated,

355
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:41,308
- can create sexual feeling.
- That's my penis.

356
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,686
Well, you don't have to tell me.
Nothing?

357
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,271
No, just a little curiosity

358
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:47,231
as to why you're checking
your second hand.

359
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:49,400
Oh, this isn't my office.

360
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,193
You know, I-I don't get it.

361
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,738
I've been popping the pills,
and, I mean, I mean, nothing.

362
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,780
- Are you under any pressure?
- Oh, no.

363
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,324
Nothing out of the ordinary.

364
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,201
I mean, there's some
violating federal law stuff

365
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,537
that'd put me in prison
for the rest of my life,

366
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,582
but I've made love with
treason charges over me before.

367
00:13:04,624 --> 00:13:05,832
But no, it's something else.

368
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,042
It's not just the sex.

369
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:09,629
I feel...

370
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,089
(sobbing):
I feel wrong.

371
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,840
Somehow.

372
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,800
(sobbing)

373
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:18,763
And I'm becoming weak.

374
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:19,930
(inhales)

375
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:21,390
Sorry, had the old
thinking cap on.

376
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,183
Let's go to the lists.

377
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:24,893
NARRATOR: And Dr. Norman
proceeded to run through

378
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,937
a checklist of alternative
medicine questions.

379
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,439
Okay, did you drink some water
that might have

380
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:30,065
a homeopathic memory
of some molecule?

381
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,275
Do you keep track

382
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:32,652
of the molecules you ingest?

383
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:34,069
Well, with homeopathy,

384
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:35,571
it's the molecules
you don't ingest.

385
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:36,947
But I'm the one
who can get hard,

386
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,616
so let's focus on you.

387
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,951
He then went on to explore
some supernatural

388
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:42,473
or high-concept
premise possibilities.

389
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,204
Any earthquakes
in a Chinese restaurant

390
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:46,206
- while you were trying to prove
something to your mother? - No.

391
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,583
Any wishes you may have
phrased badly,

392
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,335
or while a child
was blowing out a candle?

393
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,961
No.

394
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,797
Have you come across
any ancient games, let's say,

395
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:56,091
glowing games, uh, either
board based or carnival based,

396
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,594
that you may have played against
the wishes of your best friend?

397
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:00,638
- No.
- Curses, hexes, spells,

398
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,517
shaman, medicine men?

399
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:06,185
Wait.

400
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:08,604
The strong will become the weak.

401
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,273
The weak will become the strong.

402
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:15,235
I did hallucinate one ancient
foreboding warrior harbinger

403
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,655
while I chewed maca root
about a year ago.

404
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:19,448
Could that be something?

405
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,283
- No, it's not the maca.
- (filtered breathing)

406
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,493
Your body wants the maca.

407
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:23,869
It's not the maca.

408
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,954
But finally,
out of desperation,

409
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,456
he turned to Western medicine.

410
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,208
Okay, tell you what,
let's get some film on you.

411
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,585
I'd like you to get
on an MRI machine

412
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,128
and try to ride it to climax.

413
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,714
I'm gonna send you over
to Orange County Imaging--

414
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,507
they do a ton of that.

415
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,091
Okay, do I get magazines?

416
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,135
Yeah, I'll write you
a script for that.

417
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,638
They got a place right around
the corner that plays ball.

418
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,014
- Thank you.
- (men shouting in Spanish)

419
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,391
Oh, (bleep). Run.

420
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:48,268
What? Oh.

421
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,021
And soon, after getting
his prescription filled...

422
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:52,022
Uh... hola...

423
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:54,441
I have a, um--magazines?

424
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,612
(men conversing quietly)

425
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,113
...he was on his way

426
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,533
to debase himself
in an MRI machine

427
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:06,286
when he ran into a son
with whom he'd lost touch.

428
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,250
Dad, what are you doing here?

429
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:15,337
I wanted to speak to you...
in person.

430
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,922
Then you're here to apologize;
that right?

431
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:18,643
- Sure.
- Although, he covered pretty well.

432
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:22,553
And-and of course to see you
at Orange County Im-a-gine.

433
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:25,681
I went to you
for a simple signature,

434
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:27,974
and you told me to go to hell.

435
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:30,436
Actually, it was
the newly potent Oscar,

436
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,813
who, like one of
Gob's sick bees,

437
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:35,900
was pollinating one barren
flower after another,

438
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:36,859
who told Michael to go to hell.

439
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,861
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

440
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:41,029
Which is how George Sr.

441
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:42,948
not only was left with
Senor Senoritas,

442
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,325
and that's when he got a lead
on his wall problem.

443
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,035
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

444
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,621
I know a lot of people, sure.

445
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:50,915
And soon, he surprised Michael

446
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:52,999
by giving him his rights
for the movie project.

447
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:57,379
I didn't know it was about
lying to a girl.

448
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,215
- Give me the release.
- You'd do this for me?

449
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:02,217
- Of course I will.
- And then, didn't surprise him.

450
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,553
If you'll do something for me.

451
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,680
I knew it.

452
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:10,392
Michael, you got to get
this Love guy against the wall

453
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,685
between the U.S. and Mexico.

454
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,103
That's not right.

455
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:14,438
You're really opposed
to this wall, huh?

456
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,606
When did you
become pro-immigrant?

457
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:16,732
I have changed, Michael.

458
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,318
I cry (clears throat)

459
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,237
at the drop of a hat,
and I hate the way I look.

460
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,282
I actually had one cute hat,
and it...

461
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:30,120
it blew off
at the CVS parking lot.

462
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,081
(sobbing): And this whole car
full of black kids ran over it,

463
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,207
for no reason.

464
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,919
And they saw it!

465
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,754
They saw it!

466
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,547
Michael...

467
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,549
(pats bench)

468
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,845
Anyway, I live down there now.

469
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:48,305
And I care for these people
who just want

470
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:51,350
to come into this country
and ply their wares

471
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:54,227
and let us freely fill the bay
with their culture.

472
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,229
Hey, don't get me started
on the Cinco, Dad.

473
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,023
I haven't been to one
in 20 years.

474
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,775
There's gonna be blowback there;
it's just gonna happen.

475
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,944
You can't swim in that bay
for a month after

476
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:03,737
without getting
nacho cheese sauce in your hair.

477
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,030
It's coming.

478
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:07,407
Can you help me, then,
with Love?

479
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,242
At his speech, at Cinco?

480
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:11,203
Can you do that for your dad?

481
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:14,373
What he didn't tell Michael was
that the family would go broke

482
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:16,375
if they had to build the wall.

483
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,460
Of course I will.

484
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,715
Maybe, if he had,
Michael wouldn't have

485
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:25,133
overplayed his hand
as a big-shot producer

486
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,093
who knew lots of people.

487
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:28,554
But a deal was soon struck...

488
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,138
- Thanks, Pop.
- All right.

489
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,057
...and Michael,
signed contract in hand,

490
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:34,184
went to show off
at the Ealing Club,

491
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,645
while George Sr.,
magazine in hand,

492
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,439
went to (bleep) off
in an MRI machine.

493
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:48,407
NARRATOR: George Sr. finally
went to visit a wife

494
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:51,410
who was under the impression
that he was back for more.

495
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:52,828
The wrong land?

496
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,747
It's under control;
I'm trying to get Love

497
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:56,373
to come out against the wall.

498
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,834
We can't afford to build it
if we're not

499
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,794
selling the land
back to the government.

500
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,337
It'll ruin us.

501
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,673
It'll ruin us
if we don't build it.

502
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:07,342
George, you've gone puny again.

503
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,803
Where's the man who took
ahold of me yesterday

504
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,221
and bent me over this couch?

505
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:14,016
Okay, okay,
let's not sully its memory.

506
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:18,228
Look, we make sure Herbert Love
comes out against the wall,

507
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,313
right after we get
enough of it up

508
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,232
to trigger
the government payment.

509
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:24,985
And speaking of
getting enough of it up,

510
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:26,653
what's going on down here?

511
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:30,198
You need a little more Marilyn
like I did yesterday?

512
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,285
♪ Happy birthday,
Mr. President... ♪

513
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,787
I-I don't want to be
Mr. President.

514
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:37,581
Huh. Especially with
all this going down.

515
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:40,876
Oh, and speaking of president,
what's happening with Gob?

516
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,210
You gave him a job?

517
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:43,963
Yes, but then I-I fired him.

518
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,839
He caused my colony to collapse.

519
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:49,175
Oh, my God, George,
get him another job.

520
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,971
You must have some favors
you can call in somewhere.

521
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:56,182
And then you can have some of
my favors, Mr. President.

522
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,977
As much as I'd like to stay

523
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,436
and lay some more pipe with you,

524
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:01,354
I better get moving
on this thing.

525
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:02,606
And so, the next day,

526
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:04,984
George Sr. once again
called upon his son.

527
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,526
Michael B. Project.

528
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:08,487
GEORGE SR.:
Yeah, you got to give Gob a job.

529
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,072
Something in
the, uh, building company

530
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:13,075
or, uh, hey, I think
he'd get a big kick

531
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,367
out of the movie business.

532
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:15,619
N-N-No, Dad, hey.

533
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,370
He knows nothing
about producing.

534
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,623
GEORGE SR.: Look, I don't care
if it's producing a movie

535
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:21,041
that's never gonna be made

536
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,293
or selling houses
that no one's gonna buy,

537
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,796
I just want my son
to have a job

538
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:28,674
where his incompetence
won't be out of place.

539
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,884
Anyway, he's on his way
to Sudden Valley now.

540
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:32,761
No, he isn't.
No, no, come on, Dad...

541
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,220
- No, no, now?
- GEORGE SR.: What, what?

542
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:35,764
He's gonna make it
less valuable?

543
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:37,223
Which I told you
was gonna happen, by the way.

544
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:38,558
MICHAEL: Oh, here it is.
Here it is.

545
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,435
Yeah, there it is!
Knew it was coming.

546
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:42,938
NARRATOR: And even though George
had imposed on Michael,

547
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,356
it was Gob...

548
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:46,232
GOB:
What the hell?

549
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,276
...who felt
he had a cross to bear.

550
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:51,030
MICHAEL:
What the hell?

551
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:52,739
(tires screeching,
horns honking)

552
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,282
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, I got the right of--

553
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,044
- Hey, hey, hey...
- N-No, don't. It's mine.

554
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,953
- Okay, coming through here.
- Mine... Hah!

555
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:00,622
No... no, no!
My right of... way!

556
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,207
- There! Mine!
- Okay. (weak laugh)

557
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:03,458
Hey...

558
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:09,173
Gob!

559
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:10,674
(chuckles):
Michael!

560
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:11,967
And the two brothers
reunited...

561
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,052
Hey, Gob.

562
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,094
Michael.

563
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:15,679
...happy to see each other.

564
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,181
Gob?

565
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:18,640
At first.

566
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,101
Michael.

567
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:23,020
So, hear you need help moving

568
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:25,981
these memorials to the death
of the housing market.

569
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:28,734
(mailbox plays tune,
then stops)

570
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:30,235
Actually that was a memorial

571
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,696
- to the death of Pete the mailman.
- I knew that.

572
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:36,116
I brought one, too--
size of the man's heart.

573
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:38,952
I just got to figure out
how to get it out of the car.

574
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:40,871
If I could remember
how I got it in.

575
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:42,831
That's not
from your Christian magic act?

576
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:45,042
Christian magic act?

577
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:47,460
If I were Muslim, would you say
"Muslim magic act"?

578
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:51,506
No, but it is hard to imagine
any Muslim handcuffing himself

579
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:54,426
to a glittery cross
and living to tell about it.

580
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,803
Yeah, well, the Christians
aren't so (bleep)-hot

581
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:58,597
about it either.

582
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,974
Hmm, well...

583
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:03,643
NARRATOR: Michael could see
that his brother was unhappy

584
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,437
and that his life had not
worked out

585
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:07,313
the way he had hoped.

586
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:11,276
Things are incredible for me,
I'm having an incredible year.

587
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,820
I am a movie producer now,
producing a movie,

588
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,321
so they've got me
in this enormous office.

589
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:16,803
I told 'em
I don't want to be driving

590
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:18,408
to Beverly Hills
every single day,

591
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,703
so they put me in an enormous
office just over here.

592
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:26,041
Rental.

593
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,919
My personal life is off
the charts. I've met someone.

594
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,797
Can't really give you any
information--kind of famousy.

595
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:33,465
- Well, good for you. I also met someone.
- Have you?

596
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:36,009
Also famousy.
Can't give you any information.

597
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:38,595
In fact, Michael didn't even
find out who she was

598
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:40,722
until one night, earlier.

599
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:43,142
Oh, my God. I'm dating Ron
Howard's girlfriend.

600
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,769
Although he did have
some of the details wrong.

601
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,896
She's an actress.
You know her.

602
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:51,150
She was Ron's
illegitimate daughter,

603
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:52,567
a fact unbeknownst to many.

604
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:54,444
Well, we kind of like to keep
that quiet.

605
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:58,657
A woman who, like Bryce Dallas
and Paige Carlyle,

606
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:01,660
was named after
where she was conceived.

607
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:05,538
And she actually had worked
for some A-list directors.

608
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,999
She did a Terrence Malick...

609
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,293
REBEL:
Are we the same?

610
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:10,794
She got the lead
in a Woody Allen film...

611
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:12,516
But I felt like I was in
The Iceman Cometh,

612
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:15,048
but, you know,
in my case, he faketh.

613
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,217
...and was once even directed
by her own father.

614
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,343
Action!

615
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,304
Next time, don't pocket it,

616
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:21,346
pay for it.

617
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,765
Shoplifting: not cool.

618
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,685
- ...in a public service announcement.
- And cut!

619
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:27,853
Which, like all of
Ron's work...

620
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,062
You know, I think we got it.

621
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,148
...was inspired
by a photograph.

622
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,899
Rebel was indeed a rebel.

623
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,902
But Michael didn't possess
that information.

624
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,904
I can give you some information
about your airless office

625
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:39,489
you're gonna be spending
most mornings in.

626
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:40,949
You know, what I could go for
is some guac.

627
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,450
Well, you don't live there
anymore, Gob.

628
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:44,703
This heat just makes,
makes me want guac.

629
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:46,746
Now, now, I know
I've got these things,

630
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:49,291
uh, very, you know,
meticulously maintained.

631
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,793
- (squawk)
- There's...

632
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,003
There are some vultures.

633
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,172
I think they might
still smell Pete.

634
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:57,174
Yeah, if it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

635
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,842
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

636
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:00,969
- to bring the people in.
- I'm ready to move in today.

637
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,846
No, well, people other than you,

638
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:04,472
- bring those people in.
- I'm starving.

639
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:05,765
Starving? No, you're not
gonna find anything here.

640
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:06,967
They've been abandoned for...

641
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:11,771
Lindsay.

642
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:14,649
No, no, this--maybe Tobias.

643
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:15,859
NARRATOR:
It was John Beard.

644
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,443
Shall we?

645
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:19,196
Well, the value of these homes
isn't gonna go down

646
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:20,446
if we don't sell one today.

647
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:23,158
Let me see
if I can find a, uh...

648
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,534
Do you have a bottle opener?

649
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:26,536
Great idea.

650
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,830
And after a few more drinks and
a little more depreciation...

651
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,874
- That was surprising.
- ...Michael admitted he had

652
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,292
a rival for his girlfriend.

653
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:35,003
You don't have to worry
about Ron Howard.

654
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:36,922
I mean, he's not
competition for you.

655
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:38,257
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, the guy's

656
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,050
like 100 years old.
What's he gonna do,

657
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,425
poke you in the eyes?

658
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:42,594
Oh, you're confused.

659
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:43,678
Ron Howard directed Apollo 13.

660
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,389
You're thinking of Moe Howard,

661
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:47,391
the angry stooge who's been dead
for a quarter century.

662
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:49,226
Well, that's good 'cause the
whole time I'm thinking, like,

663
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,560
"unless she likes
a guy who's funny."

664
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,271
- Sure.
- Because that guy is funny.

665
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:53,813
- 'Cause the whole time you're like...
- You know...

666
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,607
- "Is he gonna poke me in the eyes?"
- Gob,

667
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,193
I don't think that th-the
movie--it might not even happen

668
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,237
because I don't think
that I can ask my son.

669
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,906
What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

670
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:04,950
You don't need to tell me
about disappointment and sons.

671
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:07,911
Let's not forget Steve Holt.

672
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,330
That's the story
of our relationship.

673
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:12,540
Right, well, I was talking about
a son disappointing a father.

674
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:14,126
Yeah, that does make it
different.

675
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,628
Look, Michael,
he doesn't respect you,

676
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:17,921
so you have
to make him respect you.

677
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:19,505
Show him that you're a big shot,

678
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:21,549
that you don't need to
live in your son's dorm.

679
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,760
(sighs) No, I just live
in my parents' penthouse now.

680
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,595
Well, then, take him to the
Ealing Club; it's all showbiz.

681
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:27,013
I used to hang out there
all the time.

682
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:29,057
It's just actresses
and stuff like that.

683
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,725
I don't know
if I could pick up the phone

684
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,560
and call him and ask him.

685
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:33,979
- You know what, Michael?
- Hmm?

686
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,814
I'll call him for you.

687
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,900
Really, you'd do that for me?

688
00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:40,444
It's the least I could do.

689
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:42,528
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

690
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,449
Did you actually have
an old one?

691
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,449
'Cause it always seemed
like you were just looking

692
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:48,827
for the easy way out.

693
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:51,371
Yeah, that was it.

694
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:54,040
Hi, I'm George Bluth
of the Bluth Company, and, uh...

695
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:55,962
NARRATOR: George Sr.,
meanwhile, was also finding

696
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,401
an easy way out
of the wall problem.

697
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,837
...we've built this wall.

698
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:03,091
We have miles and,
and miles of wall.

699
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,051
Will you confirm that, soldier?

700
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:07,553
(soldier grunts, gags)

701
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:09,139
It's ab-about protecting
our border,

702
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:10,932
which is why, uh,
we have a member

703
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:13,935
of our armed forces
with us today.

704
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:15,728
- (coughing)
- Say hello.

705
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,230
(Buster grunts)

706
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,774
It's, uh, triple-reinforced,
steel-reinforced,

707
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:22,694
and I don't really
know how to, how to say

708
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:26,072
that, uh, what it does is,
it protects, um...

709
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:27,657
It's Mexican-proof.

710
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:29,451
(laughing):
So-- can't say-- it...

711
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,286
Well, gosh darn it,

712
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:33,163
it is Mexican-proof.

713
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:34,331
(gags, snorts)

714
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:35,539
Sit up.

715
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,791
- Uh...
- Daddy, my tummy's turning.

716
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,210
All right.

717
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:39,752
- Uh, it's, uh, triple-reinforced.
- I got...

718
00:25:39,794 --> 00:25:41,087
Daddy, I got to get out,

719
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,546
- I got to get out.
- Uh, we're gonna be...

720
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:43,882
Oh, for God's sakes, get out.

721
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:45,467
I need to get out,
I need to get out.

722
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,219
- Oh, for...
- I need to get out, I need to get out.

723
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,096
We're not gonna... we'll edit
this part out and, uh...

724
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,848
Anyhow...

725
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,476
NARRATOR: But George Sr.
hadn't built miles of wall.

726
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:58,604
He just found a roundabout way
to make it seem that way,

727
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:01,066
and one week later at Cinco,
George arrived,

728
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,484
hoping to hear Herbert Love...

729
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,319
No, thanks. I've already crushed
one with my car.

730
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:07,322
...sway public opinion
against the wall

731
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,157
so the Bluth Company
wouldn't be on the hook

732
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,574
- to build it for real.
- Pop, hey, hi.

733
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,536
- Michael, what happened?
- Yeah.

734
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:14,496
Oh, the--it's a terrible week,

735
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:16,915
but I'm gonna fix things
once and for all right now.

736
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:18,542
- Is this about Love?
- No, it's about money,

737
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:23,547
but I-I'm--I will pay her back,
uh, one way or the other.

738
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:24,630
Who?

739
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:25,965
Lucille 2--I'm gonna get her

740
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,800
- against the wall.
- No, no, no, no, no,

741
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:29,677
she cannot know about this wall.

742
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,971
Fine, I'll get her up against
the top of the staircar.

743
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,932
I don't care,
it's gonna happen, though.

744
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,559
I am talking about Herbert Love.

745
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,228
- Is he going to oppose the
building of the wall? - Oh, yes.

746
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,771
I took care of that.

747
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:42,065
He is going to announce that
in his speech tonight.

748
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:43,066
That is great news.

749
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:44,817
Listen, I-I-I have to go.

750
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,779
I have to see if I can pass
this testosterone test.

751
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,322
I do, too.
(chuckles)

752
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:51,491
And, listen, not a word to...

753
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,159
How dare you?

754
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:56,620
Lucille 2.

755
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,582
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

756
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:00,083
I was going to cut you in.

757
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,334
I was trying to protect you

758
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:03,295
so they wouldn't link you to it,

759
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:05,880
but it turns out that we can't
afford to build it anyway.

760
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:09,551
- Build what?
- The wall in Mexico, the, the high wall.

761
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,886
- What were, what were you talking about?
- I was talking

762
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:15,307
about you giving money
to Herbert Love in his campaign

763
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,392
- against me.
- Oh, no, no,

764
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:19,561
that was to get Love
to support the wall.

765
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:21,854
Oh, I tell you, I've been
all over the place on this one.

766
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:24,648
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

767
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,900
I campaigned against!

768
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:28,570
Listen to me,
it's taken care of.

769
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:29,653
I just ran into Michael.

770
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,574
He's got Love against the wall.

771
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,826
It's done, it's gonna be in
the speech tonight, it's over.

772
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,411
It better be,

773
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:39,289
or I'll talk about it
in my speech tonight.

774
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,833
Now, I've got a staircar
to wave from.

775
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:43,251
And I can't be seen with you.

776
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,668
'Cause I'm fat.

777
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,670
It's because I am fat.

778
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:48,714
You think I'm a fat person.

779
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:51,134
You are such a drama queen.

780
00:27:51,176 --> 00:27:52,344
NARRATOR:
George Sr. was worried.

781
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:53,886
These fat arms.

782
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,430
I don't understand this.

783
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:58,266
And so, it was in
a state of agitation

784
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:00,852
that George Sr. arrived
for his doctor's appointment.

785
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:02,061
Excuse me, Dr. Norman?

786
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:04,063
- You're mistaken.
- Dr. Norman,

787
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,107
it's me, George Bluth.

788
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:10,028
Oh, George, yes,
thank you for meeting me here.

789
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:14,240
I like to do a little
housecleaning on the fourth.

790
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,741
(indistinct radio transmission)

791
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:17,410
Old quinceañera candles.

792
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:21,498
I was wondering if you could
tell me my test results.

793
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,915
Oh, yes, yes, uh, well,

794
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:24,876
your testosterone numbers
are off the charts.

795
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,085
(sighs)

796
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:27,253
Below the charts,
under the charts.

797
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,172
I don't know how to say that.

798
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:30,882
You have almost
no testosterone at all.

799
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,884
I don't know the exact numbers,
but it's somewhere

800
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:34,386
in the baby range.

801
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:36,804
On the plus side,
your estrogen levels are that

802
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,683
of a very healthy woman
in the throes of her menses.

803
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:41,560
May I see my results?

804
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:43,353
Ah, I wish you'd asked me
about five minutes ago.

805
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:44,604
I think I dumped it
with a pot pipe

806
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:45,938
and a bottle
of cheetah sedative.

807
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,940
Also, the people
at Orange County Imaging

808
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:51,236
said that you were masturbating
in an MRI tube?

809
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:53,530
- Oh, no.
- But, Doctor,

810
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:54,698
you, you told me to.

811
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:55,865
I did no such thing.

812
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:56,824
Oh, no.

813
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:59,827
No, no, you can't do that.

814
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,538
That sounds like something
I would say

815
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,081
when I had my thinking cap on.

816
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:04,416
(laughs)

817
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:06,876
You, sir, are a very funny lady.

818
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,007
That's what they always say
to the unattractive one.

819
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:15,968
NARRATOR: It was finally time
for Herbert Love

820
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,972
to make his speech, when the
party was suddenly ransacked.

821
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,641
Of course, it was Cinco,

822
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,268
so it took a while
for anyone to notice.

823
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,228
It appeared
the Hispanic community had had

824
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,854
enough of Cinco de Cuatro.

825
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:28,981
- Oh, God, the blowback.
- CROWD: Put up this wall!

826
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,900
But the blowback created
a greater blowback

827
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:33,570
as the crowd that had gathered
to hear Herbert Love speak

828
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:34,820
was whipped into a frenzy.

829
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:37,449
Put up this wall!
Put up this wall!

830
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,159
And that's when George knew
he was in real trouble.

831
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,953
Put up this wall!

832
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:45,373
Fortunately,
he was able to find a disguise.

833
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:46,458
(crowd cheering)

834
00:29:48,543 --> 00:29:49,919
Oh, God.

835
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,047
- Unfortunately...
- This feels right.

836
00:29:58,094 --> 00:30:00,639
NARRATOR:
Lindsay surprises Michael

837
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,724
after a long absence
from his life.

838
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,768
Lindsay.

839
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,394
It's been a long time.

840
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:07,729
I know.

841
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:10,732
Oh, this is
a little embarrassing.

842
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,275
But I have been meaning
to get down there,

843
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:14,152
- so let's just...
- You're right,

844
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:17,155
I mean, it's not like we're
even technically related.

845
00:30:17,196 --> 00:30:21,159
- That's true.
- Okay, well, then, I'll start with a smear.

846
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,163
NARRATOR: And George Sr. gets
more comfortable in hiding.

847
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:26,623
GEORGE SR.:
Yes?

848
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:28,541
Uh, Detective Smee,
Orange County Police.

849
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:29,875
I need to speak with you.

850
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,212
Lucille Austero went missing
last night.

851
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:35,131
- You mind if we ask you a few questions?
- Oh...!

852
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:37,008
I-I don't allow men
in my apartment

853
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,894
without my husband present.

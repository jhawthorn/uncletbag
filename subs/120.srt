00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:22,876
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael was preparing</i>
<i>for a meeting with the Bluth Company board...</i>

6
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:25,502
<i>to decide what to do with</i>
<i>some recently unfrozen funds.</i>

7
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:27,877
Wow. Exciting, huh?

8
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:30,917
- Finally getting some money.
- What do you want, Lindsay?

9
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,851
- I'd like some of that money.
- Well, this money is for land.

10
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:36,116
Okay? We're not gonna burn through it
like Dad did when he was in charge.

11
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:39,215
With his bad investments,
and his corrupt dealings...

12
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,227
- Mother's neck.
- No, that was a good investment.

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,229
It is easier to look at now, isn't it?

14
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:47,791
What if I told you that the money was
for something really worthwhile?

15
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,893
- Like what?
- I want to have an affair.

16
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:54,304
Now, I'm not sure with who yet,
but I'll need lingerie, waxings...

17
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,308
These are some real costs, Michael.

18
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,244
- I take it things aren't
getting better with Tobias.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:03,875
<i>[Narrator] Things hadn't been getting</i>
<i>better with Michael's sister and her husband.</i>

20
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:06,613
- <i>Even after she came up with</i>
<i>a plan to get his attention</i>.
-? [Disco]

21
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,621
Oh, my God. Listen to the radio.

22
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:12,420
- <i>I haven't heard this song</i>
<i>since we first started dating</i>.
<i>-? [Disco]</i>

23
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:16,121
I just feel like using my body.

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,530
Well, Lindsay, could you use it over there?
I'm trying to grow.

25
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,331
Yeah. It's clear that's not gonna happen.

26
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:26,702
We had sex once in the last year,
and he just laid there.

27
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:28,707
All right. Look, this money is for land.

28
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:30,709
I'm not gonna give you money
to have an affair.

29
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:33,143
Why don't you pick something else
to boost up your self-worth?

30
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:35,909
How about, uh, charity?
Why don't you get back to your roots?

31
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:38,884
Well, it has been a while.
[Inhales Sharply] All right!

32
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:41,546
I'm gonna go do that right now.

33
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,022
You're gonna go get your hair done,
aren't you?

34
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:47,993
Well, if I'm gonna have an affair...

35
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,995
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

36
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:53,794
<i>[Narrator] Michael got a message</i>
<i>he intended to ignore.</i>

37
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,801
<i>Until he read the next line.</i>

38
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:59,634
- <i>A matter ofland, Mom?</i>
- Oh, that's funny.

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,302
I meant "a matter of'L' and 'D'..."
Life and death.

40
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:06,243
What is the matter of life and death?

41
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:09,145
Buster's jaw clicks when he eats.

42
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>I think it's what's</i>
<i>driving his friends away.</i>

43
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,382
I sent him to Canada
for an operation.

44
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:16,718
So I'll need some of that new money
that just came in.

45
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:19,122
You know, Mom, if you want an operation
that's really gonna help him...

46
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,558
you ought to have them
finally cut that cord.

47
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,994
- He needs me.
- He doesn't need you.

48
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:27,761
You coddle him. He's too old to go running
to his mommy with all his problems.

49
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:31,031
I seem to remember a certain someone...

50
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:35,006
running to Mommy when his
algebra teacher made an example of him.

51
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:38,977
<i>[Narrator] Michael had been suspended</i>
<i>when another boy cheated offhis test.</i>

52
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,571
Tracy won't marry me.
I won't get a job, and...

53
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,946
[Shushing]

54
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,747
What is this?
What's happening?

55
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,788
Let Mama take care of it.

56
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,189
I'll have a little chat
with Mr. Vandenbosch.

57
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:56,695
<i>The next day, Mr. Vandenbosch</i>
<i>was not in school.</i>

58
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:59,425
<i>He was never heard from again.</i>

59
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:04,368
I know life is not fair to women. Your children
grow up, and they don't need you anymore.

60
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:07,908
And I seem to remember
a certain grown man...

61
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,908
who completely fell apart
two weeks ago...

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,878
when I taped over the <i>Nova</i> special
that had the girl on it he liked.

63
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:17,212
That was Buster. That's my point.

64
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:24,052
<i>[Narrator] George Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was at the frozen banana stand...</i>

65
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,058
<i>when he thought he spotted</i>
<i>a familiar face:</i>

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,129
Pop-Pop?

67
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,824
Sorry, miss. [Chuckling]
Pop-Pop!

68
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:34,400
- You think you saw Pop-Pop?
- But with hair! Which is probably why...

69
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,766
- he asked for my hair, remember?
- Give Pop-Pop your hair!

70
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,066
- Give me the hair!
- It all adds up.

71
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:43,109
He stole somebody's hair,
made a wig, knocked out the guard...

72
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,804
tunnelled his way through a sewer line,
and then stopped to get a candy apple...

73
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,746
- on his way to Mexico!
- Of course!

74
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,044
- You're mocking me.
- [Scoffs] Of course.

75
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:54,815
Listen, I know what I saw, Maeby.
And there's no other explanation.

76
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,789
<i>So listen. My twin brother's in town.</i>
<i>I want you to take care ofhim.</i>

77
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,292
- You still see Uncle Oscar?
- Tell you what.

78
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:03,158
Give him ten grand
from the, uh, new cash.

79
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:06,495
- Just send him on his way.
- Dad, the money is for the business, okay?

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,591
- I'm not just gonna hand it all out.
- Michael!

81
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:11,034
This is my brother. Do you know
what it's like to have a sibling...

82
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:13,038
who has no source
of income except for you?

83
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,507
just one? No. No idea.
It sounds wonderful though.

84
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,874
Look, the board is watching
every move I make.

85
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,972
EspeciallyJordan. He's just waiting for me to
screw up, so he can blow the whistle on me.

86
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,880
Why don't you just
buy him out of his stock?

87
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:27,351
No, no.
He wants twice the value. But...

88
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:29,888
Listen. Stop tellin' me what to do
with the money, please?

89
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,357
I've got a plan for the board meeting that's
gonna take the gun right out ofJordan's hand.

90
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,190
<i>Listen, you've got the money now.</i>
<i>And you know my price.</i>

91
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:38,197
You don't need
a whistle-blower around here.

92
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,699
Interesting choice of words,
Mr. Jordan.

93
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,826
He's right.
We don't need <i>a</i> whistle-blower.

94
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:46,998
We need a building full
of whistle-blowers.

95
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,007
<i>Okay? Whistles.</i>

96
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:53,068
<i>I want this place to be honest. That's</i>
<i>exactly why I had these made up for us.</i>

97
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,513
- When you see something wrong, I wa...
- [Whistles]

98
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:59,381
There you go. I want you to report it.
I want you to...

99
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:02,421
- [Whistles]
- Exactly. Just like that.

100
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:04,514
- I want us to police ourselves as vigilant...
- <i>[Whistling]</i>

101
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,355
Let's wait till something actually happens
though. Okay, good fun. [Chuckles]

102
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:09,361
All right.
Hey. Enough!

103
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:12,193
45, 46, 47...

104
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:14,563
Okay, there's still
three whistles left out there.

105
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,000
- Who's got the whistles?
- [Whistles]

106
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:19,868
- He kept one.
- There's a good example of whistle-blowing.

107
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:23,876
But you've kept yours,
so it's hurting your case.

108
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:26,344
- I was in the bathroom when you asked for it back.
- <i>[Whistling]</i>

109
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,608
- <i>[Man] No, he wasn't.</i>
- In any event...

110
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:30,843
we are going to be
responsible with this money.

111
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:33,249
Michael, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything...

112
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:38,121
- but I'd love to get a hunk
of that new company money.
- <i>[Whistling]</i>

113
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:42,662
I just need to prove to my wife
that I can act like a man.

114
00:05:42,763 --> 00:05:47,132
And it's not about sex. I don't just
lie there, if that's what you're thinking.

115
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:51,193
- That's not what I <i>was</i> thinking.
- Sorry, I just...

116
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:53,899
- A quick question for Michael.
- Is this about the money?

117
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:56,977
- No! [Chuckles]
- What do you want?

118
00:05:57,077 --> 00:06:00,137
It's not about money in the sense that I'm
saying, "Here, Michael, take some money."

119
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:04,047
It's just more of a "May I have some?"
kind of visit.

120
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:06,381
<i>Don't you have a wife</i>
<i>that you can ask now?</i>

121
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:07,755
- She left me.
- For Tobias?

122
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:08,722
- She left me.
- For Tobias?

123
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,722
- For me?
- No!

124
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:14,225
- She doesn't even like you.
- I'm in love with your brother-in-law.

125
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:17,229
You're in love with your own <i>brother?</i>
The one in the army?

126
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:20,391
- No. Your sister's husband.
- Michael? Michael!

127
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,901
- No, that's your sister's brother.
- I'm my sister's brother.

128
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:26,461
- You're in love with <i>me.</i> Me!
- I'm in love with Tobias.

129
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:29,565
- My brother-in-law?
- I know it can never be. So I'm leaving.

130
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:32,305
- I'm enlisting in the army.
- To be with your brother.

131
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:34,643
- No!
- Anyway, I can't be expected to live...

132
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:37,512
on the $800-a-month army-wife
stipend that I'm gonna get.

133
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:39,916
They just don't
support the spouses.

134
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,457
You don't want to end up like Uncle Oscar,
okay? Living off handouts your whole life.

135
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:46,423
Why don't you come up
with a way to make money?

136
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,826
<i>A suggestion of something to invest in,</i>
<i>or maybe, uh, maybe a business idea?</i>

137
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,763
<i>Well, I've always wanted</i>
<i>to remake</i> Annie Hall.

138
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:57,599
Except I wouldn't want to get in bed with
a green producer like a Sofia Coppola though.

139
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,265
Oh, but give me an old pro,
like a Robert Redford?

140
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:03,036
Oh, I'd jump into bed
with him in a second.

141
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:06,510
And I wouldn't just lie there,
Michael Bluth...

142
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:09,878
- if that's what you're thinking.
- Actually, that time that was
what I was thinking.

143
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:14,785
- [Chuckles]
- <i>And later that day, Maeby</i>
<i>spotted something interesting.</i>

144
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,958
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile, arrived at the salon</i>
<i>hoping to increase her self-esteem.</i>

145
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,761
<i>Unfortunately, her stylist hadjust been</i>
<i>called up by his reserve unit.</i>

146
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:30,302
- What's happening? Where are you going?
- I'm not allowed to tell.

147
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:34,807
- It's the war.
- Come on! These salon wars have got to stop!

148
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:37,536
The war, Lindsay. The real war.

149
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:40,875
<i>Lindsay was stunned, notjust</i>
<i>that she was losing her stylist...</i>

150
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,609
<i>but that apparently,</i>
<i>there was a war going on.</i>

151
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,481
Well, I'm protesting this war.
You're my friend...

152
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:48,748
and I'm not gonna let
Shauna cut my hair.

153
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,915
I'm going to take a stand.

154

<i>[Narrator] And Lindsay found a solution</i>
<i>to her self-esteem problem.</i>

155
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:58,120
<i>Gob and Tobias, meanwhile, were</i>
<i>brainstorming at a local coffee shop.</i>

156
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:00,826
- I need a cup of coffee to focus.
- It's so crowded in here.

157
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:05,064
I can't think. Okay.
What is it that people need?

158
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:07,504
People love to carbo-load.

159
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:09,906
- The bagel place.
- There you go.

160
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,776
- Hey, guys. What's goin' on?
- Just researching our investment.

161
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,714
Oh, yeah. Coffee places.
I've thought about these.

162
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:20,514
I'll tell you what. You guys come up
with a proposal, we'll try one.

163
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:23,021
<i>[Narrator] Gob and Tobias accidentally</i>
<i>had Michael on the hook...</i>

164
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,591
<i>and they didn't want to blow the deal.</i>

165
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,367
I guess that's a response.

166
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,233
- Hey, Nephew.
- Oh, hey! [Chuckles]

167
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:40,238
Uncle Oscar.
How are you doin'?

168
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,900
- Wow, you are like, like a rock.
- [Chuckling, Groaning]

169
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,444
- Oh, the tension! Come on.
- Oh, okay. That's plenty.

170
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:48,208
- Okay. That's the pancreas right there.
- What's happening now?

171
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:50,306
- [Chuckles Uneasily]
- <i>The two men reconnected...</i>

172
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,284
- <i>neither one anxious to</i>
<i>bring up the issue at hand.</i>
- One on the lips.

173
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:57,050
Obviously, Dad's in prison now. I'm running
the business a little bit differently.

174
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,284
- You do the best with what you have.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:03,056
- I have lemons, I make lemonade.
- That's a very positive attitude.

176
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:06,792
I hate the lemonade business. I hate the grind.
You have to grind so many... [Beeps]

177
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,925
- lemons.
- You're not a very metaphorical person,
are you?

178
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,800
- I need money.
- I know.

179
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:15,136
[Sighs] Ah, I cannot tell you how
that has weighed on me.

180
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,472
- <i>[Passing Gas]</i>
- Mm.

181
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:21,344
Why don't we sit over here?

182
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:26,351
So I've got too many people
watching me too closely.

183
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:30,412
So, if you're willing to work,
or if you have something of value...

184
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:33,118
The only thing I have
of value is my land.

185
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:35,821
I could give you the rights to
"All You Need Are Smiles."

186
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:39,160
That was a song I wrote for David Cassidy; he
was gonna sing it on <i>The Mike Douglas Show.</i>

187
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,860
But he was too embarrassed
to do it in front ofJohn and Yoko.

188
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:45,427
- Tell me about the land.
- It's a couple hundred acres...

189
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,769
of lemon groves,
right near Camp Pendleton.

190
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,343
If you're willing to part
with that land, Uncle Oscar...

191
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:53,811
I can guarantee you a little bit more
than that $10,000.

192
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:57,816
<i>To be honest, I've often thought of</i>
<i>giving it up to pursue my.</i>.. <i>my lost love.</i>

193
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:01,247
The love that was taken from me.

194
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:04,791
- <i>[Passing Gas]</i>
- I hope that was the espresso machine.

195
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:07,452
<i>[Narrator] Michael made the trip</i>
<i>to survey the land.</i>

196
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,359
<i>It was, indeed, beautiful.</i>

197
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:13,661
<i>And the next day, he went</i>
<i>to his father to tell him.</i>

198
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,667
- You give that gift to my brother?
- Gift? No.

199
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,567
I did not give him a gift. I told you.
The money was for investing...

200
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:21,232
- and that's exactly what I did with it, Pop.
- Oh, Michael!

201
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:23,673
This guy has got nothing in his life.
He wrote one song that...

202
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:26,974
madeJoan Baez call him
"the shallowest man in the world."

203
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,709
He has a worthless piece of property
and, yes, a head of hair...

204
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,910
only because he's never
had to work for a living.

205
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,581
- Wait. What piece of property's worthless?
- The grove. Where he lives.

206
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,921
I mean, you can't build on it.
The government has an easement on it.

207
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:42,655
- Does Oscar know this?
- Of course he knows it.

208
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:45,288
I mean, they run their...
their tanks through there.

209
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,027
Occasionally, they stop for
a little lemonade, but what's that?

210
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,228
That's a buck fifty.
You can't make much from that.

211
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:54,433
- <i>Indeed, the land was valueless.</i>
- <i>[Explosion]</i>

212
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,739
- <i>[Tank Rumbling]</i>
- Fellas! Fellas!

213
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,575
So. Tell me about
this investment you made.

214
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:09,712
<i>[Narrator] Back at the model home,</i>
<i>Lindsay had decided...</i>

215
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:12,587
<i>not to take her stylist's</i>
<i>departure lying down.</i>

216
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:16,185
I'm protesting the war.
There's a war going on, you know?

217
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:19,026
Yeah, I'm the one who told you, and
you said it happened ten years ago.

218
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,362
Hey, isn't this the same sign you used
to picket the cable company...

219
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:24,232
- when they dropped the Style Network?
- Actually, I used this one...

220
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,898
for Michael when he was too cheap
to pay for the premium channels.

221
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,805
But I added the bit
about the stylists.

222
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:33,778
You know that secret you have?

223
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,939
The one about the hair
that nobody's supposed to see?

224
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,382
- Hai...
- I saw it.

225
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:42,319
- Oh.
- I saw Pop-Pop.

226
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:44,652
Oh, right.
Pop-Pop with hair.

227
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:47,784
- You know, I should tell my dad about...
- No, you... [Beeps]

228
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,055
He might need us to help him,
so we should go check out the prison...

229
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,290
- and make sure he's not there.
- <i>[Door Opening]</i>

230
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,563
Oh. Hey, you know, I got cable.
You won that one!

231
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,730
- [Beeping]
- <i>Michael was embarrassed about</i>
<i>the bad investment he'd made...</i>

232
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,933
<i>and was hoping</i>
<i>to keep it a secret.</i>

233
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:05,170
Hi, this is Oscar. I'm off,
pursuing my lady love.

234
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,907
- Leave a message.
I'll get back to you next summer.
- [Beeping]

235
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:10,643
Hey, it's Michael. I know that you think
that you've disappeared...

236
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,083
- but I will find you.
- [Beeps]

237
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,347
- <i>Who's disappeared?</i>
- No one.

238
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:17,616
- Why do you ask? Have you seen someone?
- I've seen no one.

239
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:20,522
- Then you haven't seen anyone
that looks like Pop-Pop.
- <i>No. Why?</i>

240
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,460
<i>Has someone... who looks</i>
<i>like Pop-Pop disappeared?</i>

241
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:26,157
No. Course not.

242
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:30,431
Have you seen the agricultural report?

243
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:34,769
Nothing's hotter than coffee,
so... the trend is up.

244
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,775
So, if we could get
that check from you...

245
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:39,539
I'm not just gonna
hand out a check, okay?

246
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:41,546
You gotta come up
with an investment plan.

247
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:45,277
- You gotta call...
- Oh, we've got an investment plan.

248
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,649
- "Gobias Industries."
- Go bias.

249
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,881
- Hmm?
- As in, "Go buy us some coffee."

250
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,116
It's great. Looks good.

251
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:56,161
So, when do I start
makin' my moneys?

252
00:12:56,263 --> 00:13:02,031
Well, um, there, uh... there may not be
as much investment capital as we thought.

253
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:05,366
Uh, money's kind of
tied up in this land deal.

254
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:09,806
This is the first any of us at Gobias
Industries have heard of a land deal.

255
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,141
- We could borrow on that land.
- <i>There's not much to borrow against.</i>

256
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:15,180
The deal seems to be bad.

257
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:18,479
<i>It's Uncle Oscar's land,</i>
<i>and it may be worthless.</i>

258
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:21,145
- And the board okayed it?
- They weren't notified.

259
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:24,690
Damn it! Every time,
Dad does this to us.

260
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,318
- Gob, Dad really wasn't...
- He went around you, around the board...

261
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:31,022
- He steamrolled Gobias.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

262
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:33,497
Go down to that prison
and give him a piece of my mind.

263
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,591
- You don't need to do that.
- No, I'm doing it!

264
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,693
No, because you're in charge now.
And I'm telling him that.

265
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:40,136
No, no, no, no.
Listen, Gob, he's human.

266
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,836
He's a human being, and... let-let me try
to get us out of this, you know?

267
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:48,676
Let me just see if I can get Dad out of this
mess that he has created for himself, okay?

268
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:53,151
I'm afraid... this offer
comes off the table...

269
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:55,278
at midnight tonight.

270
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:58,017
Maybe the worst bluff
I've ever seen.

271
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,925
<i>[Narrator] Even the members of Gobias</i>
<i>agreed on that one.</i>

272
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:06,556
<i>The next day, Lindsay, having heard</i>
<i>about a military exercise...</i>

273
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,693
<i>joined a protest group and went off to</i>
<i>exercise her own First Amendment rights.</i>

274
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:13,136
This way! Thank you!

275
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,174
Right here. This way.

276
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:18,073
I ask you to make sure you're fully inside
the free speech zone...

277
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:21,170
- before beginning your protest.
- Free speech zone?

278
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,749
This is where we're protesting?
This isn't right. Where are the cameras?

279
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,444
They're in the free press zone, and if
you could save your comments until<i>...</i>

280
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:28,987
you're completely loaded into the cage...

281
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,853
Well, at least the procession will come
through here. They'll see us protest.

282
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,927
Actually, they're using their right
to cut through the lemon grove.

283
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,292
Okay, have fun, enjoy
your right to free speech.

284
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,558
The armed forces
welcomes your dissent.

285
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,533
Well, hopefully somebody
will come by we can protest.

286
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,403
My grandkids. What a surprise.

287
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,604
- Oh, he's here.
- Of course I'm here. Where else would I be?

288
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:56,910
Well, we thought you broke out of prison
and were on the lam with stolen hair.

289
00:14:57,017 --> 00:15:00,077
Don't you think that if I got out of here,
I might want to go home?

290
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:03,623
That's what we thought. But then my dad
told us about that lemon grove you bought...

291
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:05,623
- and we thought you were going there.
- Yeah, but don't worry.

292
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:08,421
We would never blow the whistle on family.

293
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,361
What lemon grove?

294
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:13,456
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And so, Michael went back to the board...</i>

295
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,933
<i>to take responsibility for his mistake.</i>

296
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:19,301
My dad screwed up. He bought something
that he shouldn't have.

297
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,704
But I guess... guess that's why
he's behind bars.

298
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:25,335
Yeah. And he's not allowed to conduct
any business from there.

299
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:29,279
[Inhales] Right, yeah.
I was involved. It wasn't all his decision.

300
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,283
You see, it was his idea, and then
I carried out the transaction.

301
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:35,946
That's even worse.
Conspiracy to commit fraud.

302
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,320
'Course, you can always
buy me off the board.

We don't have the money anymore.

304

And I assure you that nothing
illegal has happened here.

He wants to talk about the land deal

312
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:12,814

- Face it, Lindsay. They've won.

- Yeah.

329
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:02,066
I hope you're here to bring me
a check for Buster's surgery.

330
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:05,440
They made him stop eating after midnight,
and he's hungry, and he's in a foreign land...

331
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:07,877
and his jaw is clicking,
and he's scared.

332
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,212
- I don't have the money. All right, Mom?
- Then why are you here?

333
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,286
I don't know.
I don't know.

334
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,757
So, how's work?

335
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,624
It's-It's not great, Mom, since you asked.

336
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,891
It's-It's just...
It's not that great, you know?

337
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:28,058
I got a board member
who's trying to extort me...

338
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:31,604
and a seller I can't find... this whole
real estate thing is a total mess...

339
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:33,900
- I got Dad completely...
- What did your father do?

340
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,339
- Did he try to screw something up
for you again?
- No, no.

341
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,377
He didn't screw anything up.
<i>I</i> screwed something up, Mom.

342
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:42,437
l-I did it, and Dad is just,
you know, furious at me.

343
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,177
And he should be, you know? He told me
to pay off his brother, and I didn't.

344
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:47,276
Instead, I bought his worthless land.

345
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:49,912
- With the lemons and the tanks?
- I know it!

346
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:53,083
First investment I made with the company
money, and it's a total disaster.

347
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:56,162
Then I went ahead and lied about it,
which is gonna let this board member...

348
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:58,492
bring the company down...
I'm gonna ruin this family...

00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:06,834
- It's going to be all right.
- Why are you squeezing me with your body?

352
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,931
It's a hug, Michael.
I'm hugging you.

353
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,704
- Why?
- Because you need your mother right now.

354
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:15,178
But I don't get along with my...
Sorry. That was a knee jerk.

355
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:19,149
Michael. You made a mistake.
You're a human being.

356
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:22,619
But you're so forgiving
to everyone else in this family.

357
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,656
Try being forgiving to yourself.

358
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,249
Now, if you'll excuse me.

359
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,359
- Let Mama take care of it.
- <i>No, no.</i>

anything. Hey! This isn't algebra.

Hey, Mom! Hi. Listen.

00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,670
I'm sorry about yesterday.
It was a moment of weakness.

00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:47,706
Now l-I gotta go into this board meeting.
I'm just gonna tell them the truth.

If this guyJordan wants to try to get
me fired, then maybe I deserve it.

383
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:53,207
He's gone.
We bought out his shares.

384
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:58,216
- With what?
- With the money you tried to spend
on that lemon grove.

385
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,252
You got it back. How?

You know about what I was saying about
how people outlive their usefulness?

388
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,721
- That was out of line.
- I know.

389
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,026
But you made a good point.

390
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:17,831
Maybe I do need something to occupy
my time, other than my children.

391
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:20,735
Well, if you do want to spend it
together, it's fine with me.

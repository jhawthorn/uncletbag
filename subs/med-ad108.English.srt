1
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:05,186
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:07,693
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:21,707
<i>Michael Bluth had called a meeting...</i>

6
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,709
<i>with the family's longtime attorney...</i>

7
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:26,041
<i>to discuss his father's incarceration.</i>

8
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:30,811
I am so sorry.
It was a client. Okay.

9
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:33,409
<i>But he was finding it difficult</i>
<i>to get any answers.</i>

10
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:36,490
- How long was I on the phone?
- Twenty-five minutes.

11
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:39,754
With the cell phone charges,
I'm gonna round it out to about an hour...

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,590
'cause it's easier to bill...
all right.

13
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:45,996
- Anything else to go over?
- <i>We've got everything else to go over.</i>

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,558
We haven't done anything
to get my dad out of jail.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,539
Okay. First of all...
What are you doing? Pilates?

16
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:58,078
Because no 40-year-old woman
should look like that.

17
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,739
Well, no 40-year-old woman
does look like that.

18
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:03,715
<i>He was, however,</i>
<i>getting along with his sister...</i>

19
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:06,013
<i>which was unwelcome news</i>
<i>to their mother...</i>

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,486
<i>who feared this unity</i>
<i>might be used against her.</i>

21
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,489
<i>I do have some big news.</i>

22
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,786
It's going to cost you a little money...
20,000, something like that.

23
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:17,626
<i>The courts have agreed</i>
<i>to let your father out of prison.</i>

24
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,632
- This is a lawyer!
- He's a master!

25
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:21,827
For the entire afternoon.

26
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:24,427
What do you mean "afternoon"?
What afternoon?

27
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:27,803
<i>The day before Christmas,</i>
<i>in time for the Living Classics Pageant...</i>

28
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:30,103
because I know how important
that is to all of you.

29
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,645
<i>The Living Classics Pageant,</i>
<i>an Orange County tradition...</i>

30
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:36,308
<i>consists oflive representations</i>
<i>of classic works of art.</i>

31
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:39,113
<i>The Bluth family has participated</i>
<i>not only as a patron...</i>

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,383
<i>but as an integral part</i>
<i>of its most popular exhibit...</i>

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,119
<i>Michelangelo's</i> The Creation of Adam.

34
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't really want to be Adam this year.

35
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:50,761
Well, if you want to play Eve,
you got to get in line...

36
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:53,356
behind, what, about five homos.

37
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:58,395
That was wrong.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

38
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,838
<i>It's just that I have one</i>
<i>down at the office now...</i>

39
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:03,034
and, I mean, it is every day.

40
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:06,978
I would be happy to play Adam.
I'd prefer a speaking part...

41
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,073
Please don't speak for the rest of the meeting.

42
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:13,153
- Zing!
- No, no, seriously. I don't want to play Adam.

43
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:15,688
Buster, every year we go through
this song and dance...

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,352
and every year you say, "Thank you, Mama,
for making me play Adam."

45
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,225
- You're doing it.
- <i>This concerned Buster...</i>

46
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,662
<i>as he'd been secretly dating</i>
<i>his mother's best friend...</i>

47
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:28,758
<i>and chief social rival,</i>
<i>Lucille Austero.</i>

48
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,337
Can't we just stay here
and play poker again?

49
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,873
You can bet your vertigo medicine
against my anxiety pills.

50
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:37,535
No. Buster, for God's sake,
there is music to hear...

51
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:40,170
places to go, envy to stir.

52
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:43,079
Look, I'm tired of
keeping our love a secret.

53
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,778
We are going out,
and that is that!

54
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:48,787
- Oh.
- Oh, Buster. Okay, I'm okay.

55
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,720
<i>I'm okay.</i>

56
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,725
Okay. I'm gonna get out of your hair.

57
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:54,852
- We'll talk about this money later in the week.
- Excuse me.

58
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:57,988
We're not going to pay $20,000
to get my Dad out for one day.

59
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,466
No. It's a bond.
It's all refundable, unlike my time.

60
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,537
It's been a complete waste
of two hours, okay?

61
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:05,537
We're just not going to do it,
and that's that.

62
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,802
- Are you writing two hours?
- No, I'm taking notes on the case.

63
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,809
- Let me just see what you just wrote.
- You're scaring me.

64
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:15,439
just leave it alone! It is a gift from a client!
Ruining a good meeting.

65
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,643
- Barry's very good.
- He's an idiot.

66
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:20,653
Exactly. We're not trying
to get Dad out for a night.

67
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,655
We're trying
to get him out for good.

68
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:25,248
We're gonna get a new lawyer.
I actually know of one who's available.

69
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,259
His name's WayneJarvis.
He's a top guy.

70
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:29,420
<i>WayneJarvis had become famous...</i>

71
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,430
<i>after an employment</i>
<i>discrimination suit...</i>

72
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,467
<i>against the family's current attorney,</i>
<i>Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

73
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:37,799
It'll be a long time before Barry Zuckerkorn
calls anyone a homo again.

74
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:40,567
You know, I am really happy
that you two are in agreement...

75
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,801
but we're not getting rid of Barry.

76
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,902
He's like family,
and you can't fire family.

77
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:48,914
Yeah, I know.
Hey, Maeby.

78
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:51,348
<i>Maeby, where have you been?</i>

79
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,751
You left me at home.
You do remember you have a daughter, right?

80
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,948
Uh, yes, of course we remember...

81
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:58,957
and we were worried sick,
young lady.

82
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:03,587
She's fine. Our daughter's all right,
everybody, so...

83
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:06,689
- You said you didn't want her to come.
- I said I didn't want <i>you</i> to come.

84
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:10,464
- Oh, that makes more sense.
- Now she's going to think
we're totally self-involved.

85
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,768
I can fix this.
Buster's probably still in the lobby.

86
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,775
Let me go see if I can't get him
to give me the part of Adam.

87
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:19,607
And I'll see if I can get some money
from my mom.
- <i>Lupe!</i>

88
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:21,613
There are some juice glasses
on the sofa table.

89
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:23,706
<i>Mama, I'll help you clean up.</i>

90
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:25,615
There are some salad plates
on the piano.

91
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:28,586
Wow. What a party.
You make it seem so effortless.

92
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,680
What do you need money for?
A divorce?

93
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,487
No, Mom. Tobias and I
are doing fine, thank you.

94
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:35,721
- It's my credit card debt.
- Forget it.

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,627
Fine. I'll ask Michael.
He'll give it to me.

96
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:41,132
Maybe if you get him drunk.
It's the only way he'll give money...

97
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:44,136
to someone he calls
a "stay-in-bed mom."

98
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:47,867
- He said that about me?
- I thought it was harsh.

99
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:51,103
But, you know, he thinks
you're completely irresponsible.

100
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:53,840
A stay-in-bed mom.

101
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:57,213
Probably because you don't work,
and you're lazy.

102
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,149
His words.

103
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,653
- I can't believe him.
- <i>I know!</i>

104
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:04,724
just when you were
getting along so well.

105
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,590
They've got to be kidding me.

106
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:20,005
<i>Michael's brother Gob, meanwhile...</i>

107
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:24,203
<i>had missed the meeting that morning</i>
<i>after being delayed by his girlfriend Marta.</i>

108
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,007
<i>?: Te quiero!</i>

109
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:29,708
- English, please.
- I love you.

110
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,910
Great. Now I'm late.

111
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,351
<i>And while Gob</i>
<i>took his girlfriend for granted...</i>

112
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,117
<i>Michael was learning Spanish</i>
<i>to get closer to her.</i>

113
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:39,590
<i>That is not something I can bring to my boss.</i>

114
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:44,062
<i>Unfortunately, the one tape</i>
<i>he could find was oflittle use to him.</i>

115
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,064
<i>Are you going</i>
<i>to the complimentary breakfast?</i>

116
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,464
That'll get her hot.

117
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,538
Well, if it isn't the boy
who lives under the stairs.

118
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,539
- Hey, Gob.
- What are you doing, learning Spanish?

119
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:58,271
Nope. It's, uh... It's something for work,
so, yes, uh, yeah.

120
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:04,752
<i>Meanwhile, Buster</i>
<i>was trying to get George Michael...</i>

121
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,151
<i>Meanwhile, Buster</i>
<i>was trying to get George Michael...</i>

122
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,721
<i>to take his place as Adam.</i>

123
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:11,120
I don't know, Uncle Buster.

124
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,625
- Well, you don't have the "frontspiece" yet.
- "Frontspiece"?

125
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:18,391
Look, I don't want to go through a whole song
and dance with you. You're going to love it.

126
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:22,458
You just can't do anything that violates
the original painting, like giggling or itching.

127
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,266
They do allow some nervous crying,
but you can tell they don't like it.

128
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:30,469
<i>And Maeby was teaching</i>
<i>her parents a lesson for forgetting her</i>...

129
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:33,137
Who knows how long I'll be gone?

130
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,977
<i>when she spotted George Michael.</i>

131
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,847
Nice pecs. Got a kickin' bod.

132
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:42,753
<i>Thus, George Michael found a compelling</i>
<i>reason to keep the muscle suit on.</i>

133
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,992
Law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.

134
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:48,789
It's Michael Bluth for Barry.

135
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:52,627
- I'm not here.
- Barry's not here. Can I give her a message?

136
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,963
Tell her she needs to whisper
a little softer next time...

137
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,867
and I'm not paying
for this phone call.

138
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,668
I am not a girl, you bow-tied...

139
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:03,265
Go on. Call me something.
I'm redoing my kitchen.

140
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:06,312
That's it.
I've had it with this jerk Barry.

141
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,711
I'm going to make Mom sit down with Wayne
whether she likes it or not.

142
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,842
- You're the jerk.
- Did I just wake you up?
I didn't know you were home.

143
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:14,716
No, Michael, I don't just sleep all day.

144
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:16,722
<i>Actually, Lindsay was so upset at Michael...</i>

145
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:19,884
<i>that she tried meditating</i>
<i>to calm herself...</i>

146
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:22,758
<i>but ended up taking</i>
<i>a two-hour angry nap.</i>

147
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,024
Yeah, this suitcase
should be big enough.

148
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:28,295
Where is all this coming from?
I thought we were getting along.

149
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:31,166
Yeah, so did I. And now I hear
you're telling our mother...

150
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:34,798
that I'm completely irresponsible
and a stay-in-bed mom.

151
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,808
That doesn't even sound like me.

152
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,970
That sounds like Mom
or Bruce Vilanch.

153
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,378
- Could be Bruce Vilanch.
- Then why would she say it?

154
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:45,008
- Because we're getting along.
- Because we're friends again.

155
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,644
You gotta remember Mom
typically has nothing in her system...

156
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,746
except a bottle of vodka
and an estrogen pill.

157
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,052
Speaking of which...

158
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,491
<i>Michael and Lindsay proceeded to drink...</i>

159
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,495
<i>and air their grievances</i>
<i>about their mother.</i>

160
00:07:56,597 --> 00:08:00,294
She's always trying to get me to admit
that my marriage isn't working.

161
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:03,165
- And how's it going with you and Tobias?
- It's not working.

162
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,501
And that's why I wanted her help
with my credit card debt.

163
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,337
I'm trying to take at least some of
the pressure off this marriage.

164
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:12,844
And if anything, it's worse
now that we're sharing a bedroom.

165
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,744
You guys were not
sharing a bedroom before?

166
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,181
Well, the cutoffs
aren't exactly a turn-on.

167
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:22,551
- What's the deal with the cutoffs?
- You've got to promise not to tell anyone this.

168
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:26,353
- Okay.
- He's a never-nude.

169
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,792
Is that exactly what it sounds like?

170
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,228
<i>Tobias suffered</i>
<i>a rare psychological affliction...</i>

171
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,925
<i>of never being able</i>
<i>to be completely naked.</i>

172
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,969
Excuse me.
Do these effectively hide my thunder?

173
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:41,007
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I need you to be
completely undressed.

174
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,134
I am completely undressed.

175
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:47,042
- I thought he just liked cutoffs.
- Me too.

176
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:49,547
What about you?
What's going on with your love life?

177
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,550
<i>Have you even met anyone</i>
<i>since your wife?</i>

178
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:54,553
That is the one subject
I am not eager to talk about, Lindsay.

179
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:56,919
I love Marta.

180
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,592
- Mom's housekeeper?
- Gob's girlfriend.

181
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,163
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:08,098
Listen. You're a great guy,
and if she doesn't see that...

183
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:11,330
- then someone else will.
- You know what else, Lindsay? You're great.

184
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:15,499
And I'm gonna move some money around
if it's gonna help you get out of debt.

185
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:17,008
- No, Michael.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,672
The hell with Mom. And here.
Mom's never gonna get between us again.

187
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,477
<i>The next day, Buster,</i>
<i>having pawned off playing Adam...</i>

188
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:27,554
<i>went to Lucille 2 to ask her out</i>
<i>for Christmas Eve.</i>

189
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:31,750
That is terrific 'cause I got
two tickets to the pageant!

190
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:35,590
My... My mother's going to be there.

191
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,596
<i>And George Michael was trying to pass...</i>

192
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:40,030
- <i>as a more muscular boy than he actually was.</i>
- One hundred.

193
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:42,102
One hundred?
I had you at 10.

194
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:45,797
I did some earlier in the day. It's a running total.
So what's with the suitcase?

195
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:48,602
It's a little test
to get my parents to notice me.

196
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,609
You ever get the feeling
like no one even sees you?

197
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:55,045
I've got a really good body, so... no.

198
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,276
Hey, gang. What you doing?

199
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:59,614
- Just packing up. Packing it on up.
- Uh-huh.

200
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,950
Listen, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

201
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:05,491
- <i>I'll leave you two alone here.</i>
- Oh, no, George Michael, I meant you.

202
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:08,152
Maeby, can we have the room?

203
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,858
So, as you know, I was hoping
to play Adam in this thing...

204
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:19,996
and I want you to know
that I am not threatened.

205
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,371
You know, I'd be happy
to let you play Adam.

206
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,569
Give me the suit.
Give me the suit.

207
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:28,341
I'm actually wearing it right now,
and I can't tell you why.

208
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:30,348
You're wearing it right now?

209
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,180
I have to wear it all the time.
You'd never understand.

210
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,654
Oh, please.
I'll never under...

211
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:40,523
I'll never understand...
that you can never be nude?

212
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,759
I understand more than
you'll <i>never</i> know.

213
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,177
Yikes.

214
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,713
<i>Michael finally arranged</i>
<i>a meeting with attorney WayneJarvis.</i>

215
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:03,715
Looking for a more professional approach
to our representation.

216
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,114
Well, I'm a professional.

217
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:08,211
- I'm serious, and I'm a professional.
- That's fantastic.

218
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,756
- So how long have you been practicing...
- I also don't like small talk.

219
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:14,190
I find that unprofessional.
Why should I be billing you for small talk...

220
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,194
when I'm enjoying it
as much as you are?

221
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:19,356
Then this must be a freebie
'cause I'm having a ball.

222
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,866
When you're ready
to get serious, give me a call.

223
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:26,429
No, no! No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm serious. I'm ready.

224
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,408
Good. If you retain my services,
I will get your father out of jail...

225
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,410
and we will be countersuing
before the end of the year.

226
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:35,208
We're gonna get this company's name
back to where it started.

227
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:37,875
- Or hopefully higher.
- I didn't say that. Don't hold me to that.

228
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:41,785
I won't, and I appreciate that
to a wonderful degree.

229
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:44,288
My mother is on her way up here...

230
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:48,088
and she's resistant
to the idea of hiring a new attorney.

231
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:50,663
If she even sees you,
she probably won't come in the room.

232
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:53,289
I shall duck behind the couch.

233
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,834
What a pro.

234
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:58,695
- Michael.
- Hi.

235
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:02,036
I need to get the money
to get your father out for the pageant.

236
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:05,578
Actually, that's not why
I called you here today, and I'm not doing that.

237
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,273
I gave that money to Lindsay
to pay off her credit card debt.

238
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:11,840
- What'd she do, get you drunk?
- No, we just, uh, well...

239
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,614
We did drink a little bit.
How'd you know that?

240
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:16,621
Because that's what
she said she'd do.

241
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:19,851
I said you wouldn't give her the money,
and she said, "He will if I get him drunk."

242
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,258
Probably because she thinks
you're a cheap bastard.

243
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,353
Oh. Her words.

244
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,432
She set me up?

245
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:31,266
All that stuff about her marital troubles
and Tobias being a never-nude?

246
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:35,273
A never-nude?
I thought he just liked cutoffs.

247
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,434
How do you treat somebody
in your own family like that...

248
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:41,913
lying and deceiving and saying anything
just to get your own way?

249
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:44,779
- So what did you want to see me about?
- Hmm?

250
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:48,446
Oh, um, there's a big bowl
of candy in my office.

251
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:51,285
- Why don't you go eat it?
- <i>WayneJarvis, attorney at law.</i>

252
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:55,725
I have a responsibility to tell you
that there is no candy in this office.

253
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,320
Lindsay.

254
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:06,370
- What are you doing here?
- I had to get away from Marta.

255
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:11,308
<i>If I have to smell another meal of fish,</i>
<i>rice and mango, I'm gonna kill somebody.</i>

256
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:14,972
- Now Michael's learning Spanish.
What's up with that?
- Oh, who knows?

257
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,982
He won't get your father
out of jail for a night.

258
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,644
- He's bringing in a new attorney.
- <i>New attorney?</i>

259
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:22,688
And he's learning Spanish?

260
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,780
He's hiding something.

261
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,519
And I intend to find out what it is.

262
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:31,222
Do yourself a favor.
Get him drunk.

263
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,496
Barry.

264
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,275
I see you're getting closer
to our attorney.

265
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:47,006
<i>Well, I just want you to know</i>
<i>that I won't be needing your help after all.</i>

266
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:51,813
My brother Michael came through
as he always does and as you never do.

267
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:55,877
Whatever it takes to get your relationship
with that never-nude back on track.

268
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,357
- Michael told you that?
- He couldn't wait to.

269
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,826
<i>And later,</i>
<i>while Michael was meeting with Wayne</i>...

270
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,262
My thing with Tobias was a secret
like you stealing your brother's girlfriend!

271
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:09,062
- I open up to you, and you run and tell Mommy!
- Excuse me.

272
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,034
Outside, please.
Thank you. Pardon us.

273
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:14,801
Like it all wasn't just lies to get me to pay
that debt. Isn't that why you got me drunk?

274
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:17,035
- I <i>got</i> you drunk.
- Mom told me about your little plan.

275
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:20,409
- What plan? I had a great time last night!
- So did I!

276
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:22,880
- Then why are we yelling at each other?
- Mom.

277
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:26,384
- Unbelievable.
- She did it again.

278
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:29,387
- All right. We've got to teach her a lesson.
- Hmm.

279
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:34,626
<i>Excuse me, Wayne, my sister and I were</i>
<i>outside having a business discussion...</i>

280
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:37,253
and we were wondering
if there's some sort of legal way...

281
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:40,094
that we can humiliate our mother.

282
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,566
Something shaming, something public.

283
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:45,832
I've used one adjective to describe myself.
What is it?

284
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,907
Professional.

285
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,581
So how are we going to screw Mom?

286
00:14:56,683 --> 00:14:58,344
- Maybe we can get Barry to help.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

287
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:01,512
I think I was right about them all along.
You know Barry's taking Mom to the pageant?

288
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:03,350
- On a date?
- Yeah.

289
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:08,827
Ugh! If Dad could see her
on a date with Barry, he'd go crazy.

290
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,625
<i>Which would allow us to hire Wayne.</i>

291
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,526
How do you feel about staying in debt
just a little bit longer?

292
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:20,037
<i>So they decided to spend</i>
<i>the money Michael had promised Lindsay...</i>

293
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,167
<i>to get their father out for the pageant,</i>
<i>where he'd catch his wife with Barry.</i>

294
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:27,838
<i>Maeby, too, continued to try</i>
<i>to teach her parents a lesson.</i>

295
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:30,508
Okay, so I printed the fake airline ticket
from my computer.

296
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:34,109
If my parents miss this,
I really might go to South America.

297
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,781
- That says "Portugal."
- That's right.

298
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,020
<i>Maeby's parents didn't find the ticket,</i>
<i>but Gob did</i>...

299
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:43,027
"Portugal."

300
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,461
<i>which confirmed his suspicions.</i>

301
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:48,159
Gonna live it up down old
South America way, huh, Mikey?

302
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:51,567
<i>And Buster finally gave in</i>
<i>to Lucille 2's wishes.</i>

303
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:55,072
You ready to show me off
before God and the whole world?

304
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:57,370
It's not my dad's reaction
I'm worried about.

305
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:01,573
<i>And George Michael finally saw the painting</i>
<i>he was going to be re-creating.</i>

306
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:08,979
<i>And then what "frontspiece"meant.</i>

307
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:19,932
<i>George Sr. got his 24 hours of freedom</i>
<i>as the pageant finally began.</i>

308
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:23,764
You know, I saw you do this when I was a kid.
I was so impressed.

309
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,806
You know, you were
so still and godlike.

310
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:30,274
It was at that moment
that I knew I would be a dancer.

311
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,745
Glad I could make a difference.

312
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:36,509
<i>Michael and Lindsay searched the crowd</i>
<i>for their mother and Barry...</i>

313
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:40,074
<i>so they could revel in the public shaming</i>
<i>they had engineered.</i>

314
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:44,122
- Mom, what the hell are you doing?
- <i>But instead they found her with Wayne.</i>

315
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,124
I don't have to answer that.

316
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:48,387
I don't know which one of you
I'm more disappointed in.

317
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:50,520
No, it's Wayne. Wayne...

318
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,258
- I have needs. I am a man!
- Hey, watch...

319
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:56,130
What's the difference?
Your father doesn't care about me.

320
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,727
Barry tells me he's not even trying
to get out of prison.

321
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:01,602
- Mom, he's here. Dad's here.
- He's here?

322
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,040
- Yeah, he's here.
- Why did you do this?

323
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,476
- We were trying to teach you a lesson.
- <i>You idiots!</i>

324
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,708
- If he sees me with Wayne...
- We'll be stuck with Barry.

325
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:12,808
I shall duck behind
that little garbage car.

326
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:16,154
Guy's a pro.

327
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,156
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

328
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,988
<i>Michelangelo's</i>
The Creation of Adam.

329
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:24,291
<i>And George Michael made his debut</i>...

330
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:26,797
Hey, that's my... Yikes.

331
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,834
<i>breaking the pageant's cardinal rule.</i>

332
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,562
How dare he!

333
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,639
Oh, stop booing!
There's nothing wrong with it.

334
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,733
There are dozens of us. Dozens!

335
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,937
<i>Buster arrived with Lucille Austero...</i>

336
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:43,846
<i>and naturally assumed the yells of disgust</i>
<i>were directed toward him.</i>

337
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,077
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

338
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,347
Buster?

339
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:50,446
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

340
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:53,924
I'm sorry, Lucille.
Yeah. Lucille.

341
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:55,995
Ma, I'm sorry!

342
00:17:56,096 --> 00:18:00,624
Man! That old lady has really
done a number on you, hasn't she?

343
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:05,200
<i>But George Michael wasn't</i>
<i>the only problem with the painting.</i>

344
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,933
- Where is God?
- There is no God!

345
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:13,111
There goes my credit card payment.

346
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,477
Dad! Dad!

347
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:17,550
Hey! Dad!

348
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:21,619
- Excuse me.
- Dad!

349
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,316
- Hey, Dad, get back here!
- No! I'm not going back!

350
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,325
Dad, come here!

351
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:31,386
- Dad!
- Michael, I'm onto you.

352
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:34,160
The Spanish lessons, the lawyer.

353
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:38,067
- If you're heading for Portugal, it's due south!
- What? No, it isn't.

354
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:40,833
Dad, you're not gonna outrun me
in that dress.

355
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,899
- Let go! For God's sakes,
I'm not even wearing a jock.
- Dad, are you going too?

356
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:51,179
No one is going to Portugal, you idiot!

357
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:54,549
Lindsay and I broke Dad out of jail for a day
to catch Mom on a date.

358
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:57,350
Your mother is on a date? Oh.

359
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:58,719
Dad!

360
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:02,158
Oh, oh.

361
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:04,890
- <i>Dad?</i>
- <i>And so, many in the Bluth family...</i>

362
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:07,933
<i>gathered together</i>
<i>for Christmas Eve... at prison.</i>

363
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:10,662
- Hey, where'd your muscle suit go?
- Wait. You knew?

364
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,169
Yeah.

365
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:14,206
I took it off.

366
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,077
You did?

367
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:25,317
You have made some
tremendous strides today.

368
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:29,013
Ever get the feeling
like you don't even matter?

369
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:31,386
Only when I'm around my children.

370
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:35,359
You reach a certain age, and you have
to practically scream to get noticed.

371
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:39,364
They turn you into a monster,
and then they call you one.

372
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,866
I don't think you're a monster.

373
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,868
And I think you're a lovely girl.

374
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,234
You know what?

375
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,739
I think you and I
ought to spend more time together.

376
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,969
Yeah.

377
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,773
- That'll drive them crazy.
- Exactly.

378
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,782
<i>And Michael was forced to, once again...</i>

379
00:19:57,884 --> 00:20:00,352
<i>call in the counsel of Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

380
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:02,614
Thank you. Thank you
for coming down on Christmas Eve.

381
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:06,055
Oh, it's like any other day,
except that I bill double.

382
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,286
<i>So, they're not filing charges.</i>

383
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:12,956
I got them to call your flee from justice
"religious expression."

384
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,830
- This is a lawyer.
- Yeah, he's... he's very good.

385
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:19,063
You're gonna have to forfeit that bond.
I was way off about that.

386
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:21,299
Thanks again, Mikey.

387
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:26,411
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

388
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:29,539
Are all the guys in here, you know...

389
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,447
Oh, no, no, no.
Not all of them.

390
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:35,919
Yeah. It's never the ones you hope.

391
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,653
- Hope?
- Think.

392
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,423
- How'd it go?
- <i>Well, the bad news is you're in debt again...</i>

393
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:47,125
and we never busted Mom,
and we're stuck with Barry.

394
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:51,431
The good news is we've been asked
never to participate in the pageant again.

395
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,531
- Well, at least we're still pals, huh?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:56,943 --> 00:21:00,276
That's not really doing it for me this time.

397
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,280
Yeah.

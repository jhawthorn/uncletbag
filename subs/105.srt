<i>anxious to get to the bottom</i>
<i>of some mysterious bookkeeping.</i>

7
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,923
It just doesn't make
any sense, Dad.

8
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:31,084
Where did this money come from? Why did
it end up in the international accounts file?

9
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:34,493
<i>[Narrator] George Sr. was also anxious,</i>
<i>but less about the bookkeeping.</i>

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:37,624
This game is never gonna happen.
Half of these guys are still in their cuffs.

11
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,895
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but I'm trying to get you out of here.

12
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,666
Well, I'm trying to get us out of last place,
Michael. We're playing Rahway next week.

13
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,674
Word has it that
they're getting Jose Canseco.

14
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:49,574
I'm starting to wonder
why I even bother coming.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,408
- <i>[Inmate] Bluth! Right field!</i>
- That is ridiculous.

16
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:54,814
- You won't even talk to me!
- I'm catcher, or I'm nothing!

<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael returned to work...</i>

18

19
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:03,488
Your wife's on line one.

20
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:06,494
- <i>[Narrator] Michael's wife</i>
<i>had been dead for two years.</i>
- My what?

21
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:09,497
- <i>Kitty realized her mistake.</i>
- I said, your wife is on line one.

22

<i>But not immediately.</i>

23
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,802
Oh! Oh, God.

24
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:17,101
I'm sorry.
George's wife. Your mother.

25
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,108
I'm so used to being
George's assistant.

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,270
<i>[Narrator] Kitty had been George Sr. 's</i>
<i>fiercely loyal assistant for years.</i>

<i>she had the information he needed.</i>

28

Hey, Kitty, listen,
you wouldn't know...

29
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,621
if we had any documentation on
these international accounts, would you?

30
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:40,992
That's actually not
any of your business.

Hey, Mom.

33
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:51,473
Are you aware we've been downgraded
to being just pool members at the club now?

34
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,305
[Michael] Yeah, it's a real shame
what's going on with this family.

35
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:57,869
You're stuck by the pool,
and Dad's getting picked last for softball.

36
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,473
Nonetheless, you can free up a little company
money to get back our golf privileges.

37
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,849
No, I can't.
Mom, you don't even play golf.

38
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:07,355
No, but I use the clubhouse dining room...
until I was turned away today.

39
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,857
- It's embarrassing... Take it back!
- [Woman Gasps]

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,124
If I wanted something your thumb touched,
I'd eat the inside of your ear!

41
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,165
You should see
the looks I'm getting.

42
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:21,669
If you can't free up the cash,
have your father call the club president.

43
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:25,172
I've got news for you, Mom...
I'm not visiting Dad in jail anymore.

44
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,334
- [Gasps]
- No, I've had it.

45
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:30,709
I'm down there every single day trying to do
what I can to get this company back on track...

46
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:33,112
and he barely even acknowledges me.

47
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,116
That is disgusting!

48
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:39,177
Talk to your father.
I will not stand for this!

Can I, uh... get you
to stop doing that?

52
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,264
I'm just setting up an office.

53
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,598
Gotta write a strongly worded letter

<i>[Narrator] In order to restore</i>

<i>Gob had recently checked into prison</i>
<i>as a publicity stunt.</i>

56

- You really think you can

- You won't even know I was here.

57
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,781
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>But after a shiv to his side...</i>

58
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,112
<i>Gob was rushed</i>
<i>to a local hospital...</i>

59
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:12,154
- <i>thus fulfilling, in Gob's mind,</i>
<i>his contract with the public.</i>
-? Ta-dah?

60
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:16,055
<i>And yet the warden had refused to</i>
<i>acknowledge the legitimacy of the escape.</i>

61
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,118

<i>Gob?</i>

Don't know if a call from me

67
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,775
[Snickers]
Do you like my outfit?

68
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,473
Not as much as I like

69
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,481
Gob!

70
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,019
No, I need your chair. Get up.
I've got a letter to write.

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,020
Whoo!
You're all business.

72
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,590

73
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,559
[Mutters]
My God, she's repulsive.

74
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:55,290
<i>[Narrator] Michael realized</i>
<i>that Kitty's obvious attraction to Gob...</i>

75
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,298

00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,269

Yes, Tobias,
I want the marriage to work.

80
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:09,643
I just don't know
if therapy is the answer.

81
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:12,772
Because you didn't respect my old career,
and you certainly don't respect my new one!

82
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,782
You don't <i>have</i> a new one!

83

Okay, so, why are we doing this?

- How are they gonna see us?

What the hell's
your mother doing in here?

321
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:43,562
- Who were you expecting?
- Oh, I've done a bad thing.

322
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,327
I've done a terrible thing.

323
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:48,335
- There's someone else in
that trailer, isn't there?
- I've done a repulsive thing.

324
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:49,802
Wait... Whoa. It's Kitty?

325
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,867
- Shh!
- How long?

326
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,409
- When did this start?
- Oh, come on! This is the first time.

327
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,572
- Every Friday for the last eight years.
- [Sighs]

328
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,481
- Daddy...
- Horny. I got that.

329
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,487
Hey, wait a minute.
This is easy. This is an easy one.

330
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,183
I'll go in there with Kitty,
I'll do my thing...

331
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,988
and th-th-then I'll go and see your moth...
This is a hard one.

332
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,063
- She's your secretary.
- You're right.

333
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:17,189
Family first.

334
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,529
Take care of Kitty.
Michael.

335
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,603
I need you now.

336
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:25,071

342
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:39,420
- I'm at the prison.
- You're here?

343
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:43,253
I'm delivering
this strongly worded letter I wrote...

344
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,520
lit by nothing but natural light.

345
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:48,722

that touch lamp <i>and</i> the office...

346
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:53,359
<i>and</i>... what the hell...
full use of the secretary?

347
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:59,233
Thank you for doing this.
It means a... It means a lot.

348
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,572
I, uh... Okay,
I'll get down on the couch.

349
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:06,045
I'm not going to have sex
with you, George.

350
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,447
I came to tell you how much I hate you
for what you've done to this family.

351
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:11,884
- You're angry.
- You've ruined us.

352
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:15,889
<i>I've ruined us?</i>
<i>You got a lot of nerve, honey.</i>

353
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:19,449
The millions you pissed away on clothing
and jewelry and spa treatments...

354
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:23,157
Yes, to keep you interested in the only thing
you ever appreciated... my body.

355
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,392
Can I help it
if you've got a fantastic body?

356
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:29,335
And you're as powerful as a bear.

357
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,565
My husband the bear.

358
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:36,008
This bear needs
some honey, wife.

359
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:39,239
Oh, God, I missed you!

That's be... brighter!

370
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:04,438
God! Damn.

371
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,770

- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, where were you?

381
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,336
I had to help out your grandfather...

382
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,348
and then I had to vow that I would
never help your grandfather again.

383
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,350
Pretty much a normal day for me.

384

How are you doing?

385
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,979
I'm fine, I guess. It's just...

386
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,993
You think of prison as this place full of guilty
people and it doesn't bother you that much.

387
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,996
But if Pop-Pop could be there,
then anybody could be there.

I don't think I could take it.

00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,844
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,753
<i>Michael was adjusting</i>
<i>to his new position as vice president...</i>

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,416
<i>which meant doing the work of</i>
<i>the president, his brother Gob.</i>

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,390
- Michael.
- Hey.

8
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,622
So, did you see the new <i>Poof?</i>

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,694
His name's Gary,
and we don't need any more lawsuits.

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,964
No, I was talking about the magazine-
Wait. Gary's gay?

11
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,869
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh. He's gonna think I was coming on to him.

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,033
You've got a nice mouth.

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,134
I'd kill for that ass.

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,145
Okay, the chair's
not doing it now...

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,080
but lately it's been giving out
as soon as I lean back.

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,880
Anyway, I was talking about <i>Poof</i> magazine,
the magazine for magicians.

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,616
This guy Tony Wonder bakes himself into
a loaf of bread and pops out of a giant sandwich...

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,749
to feed the troops.

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,794
I had that idea 10 months ago.

20
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,761
- You had that idea?
- Well, basically.

21
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:09,164
I was gonna boil myself alive into a chowder
and then be ladled into a giant cauldron...

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,238
- to entertain and feed the firemen.
- That's pretty close.

23
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,431
<i>I</i> should be in this <i>Poof!</i>

24
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,175
- Michael Bluth.
- He found him. Ice found your father.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,111
<i>Michael recently</i>
<i>had hired a bounty hunter...</i>

26
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,080
<i>to track down his fugitive father.</i>

27
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,652
- Wh-Where?
- He's coming over here at 5:00 to tell us.

28
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,653
But he wants to get paid first.

29
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,087
Dad goes back to jail,
I can be cleared, I can be president again.

30
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:35,252
And I'm halfway to getting out of this office
and into a steaming bowl of soup.

31
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,692
- Everybody wins.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,664
Oscar, close it. You look like
the window of a butcher shop.

33
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,203
- Thank God I can finally get rid of him.
- I'll see you at 5:00, Mom.

34
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,297
<i>Michael then headed down</i>
<i>to the frozen banana stand...</i>

35
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,002
<i>where his son</i>
<i>was supposed to be working.</i>

36
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,103
It just seems like every time we wanna
be together, your father comes along-

37
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,978
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Why's the banana stand closed?

38
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,211
Oh, Ann came to see me,
so I thought I'd take a little break.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,652
- Can we talk about this later?
- Sure. No problem.

40
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,349
Just, let's keep the phone on.
Okay, pal? Great.

41
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,358
Hey, you.

42
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,520
See? That's a perfect example of
how your father's always interrup-

43
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,504
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,131
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy. They found your grandfather.

45
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,335
- That's what I wanted to tell you.
- That's great.

46
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,470
- I didn't wanna say that
when you were talking to Egg.
- <i>I'm still talking with</i> Ann.

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,243
Oh, she's still goin'? Listen,
I'll talk to you later. I'm very excited.

48
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,319
That's good.

49
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,190
I think we should break up.

50
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,226
<i>The bounty hunter, meanwhile...</i>

51
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,228
<i>was eager to impress</i>
<i>the family attorney.</i>

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,195
I cannot believe
that you made these.

53
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,167
<i>Indeed, Ice had always bounty-hunted</i>
<i>to support his first love</i>-

54
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,568
<i>party-planning.</i>

55
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,106
<i>And Lindsay was still hoping</i>
<i>to score a date with him.</i>

56
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,338
I don't suppose you'd be interested in
catering an affair with me.

57
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,108
Well, when you get a full guest list,
let me know.

58
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,616
Why can't I do this anymore?

59
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,618
That's got to bother you,
huh, Dad?

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,622
- I mean, she's flirting right in front of you.
- Hmm? Oh! No.

61
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:16,991
I am surprised, though, that she's going
after somebody so similar to my own type.

62
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:21,032
But I suppose we all do expose
our inner desires, don't we?

63
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,034
I think you just did.

64
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,036
No, I didn't.

65
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,467
Is there any way
I can divorce them?

66
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,475
Oh, sure.
It's called emancipation.

67
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,307
But you've got to prove that
you're living in an unstable environment.

68
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,110
Both my parents are trying to have affairs.
Of course, they haven't succeeded yet.

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,778
If they do, I could have you out of this house,
on the street, in a month.

70
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,411
- Sweet!
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,491
<i>Soon, Michael arrived,</i>
<i>and Ice began his presentation.</i>

72
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,050
When word got out that he was
building houses for Saddam Hussein...

73
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,825
he escaped to Mexico where, as you know,
he was arrested and interred in a local prison.

74
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,559
Until he was killed by this guard.

75
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,761
<i>Body was held for six days</i>
<i>within the prison walls when</i>-

76
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,397
- I'm sorry- he killed a guard?
- <i>No, the guard killed him.</i>

77
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,634
He's dead.
Buried in Mexico.

78
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,180
Uh, h-hold on. How do we know this is true?

79
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,739
Because I have here his dental records,
his death certificate...

80
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,514
and a political cartoon
from a leading Mexican publication.

81
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,818
<i>Okay, again, I'm a caterer...</i>

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:24,090
so if you do have any family events-
weddings, wakes-

83
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,427
I'll leave my card.

84
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,932
Is it true?

85
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,003
Is he really gone?

86
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,138
- Ow.
- Just checking.

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,471
These are his teeth.
He had such perfect teeth.

88
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,307
- It was that Glisten.
- He swore by that Glisten.

89
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,281
"Who left the cap off my- Glisten?"

90
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,284
<i>It's all hitting me now.</i>

91
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,445
This is really happening.

92
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,449
All this awful funeral stuff!

93
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,458
<i>The will.</i>
<i>We have to get the will.</i>

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,792
I don't know if enough time has passed.
I don't know what I'm saying.

95
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,264
Is it in your car, Barry?
I'm gonna throw up!

96
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,198
Check the car, Barry.
I don't know what I'm saying!

97
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,203
The will is not here.

98
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,706
The will is at my office, next to
the hot plate with the frayed wires.

99
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,708
I didn't, uh- It wasn't-

100
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,711
<i>In fact, Barry had lost George Sr. 's will.</i>

101
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,510
How did I get here?
Oh, my God, Lucille. He is gone!

102
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,414
We have to have a wake.

103
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,488
<i>Maeby was upset,</i>
<i>but saw a chance to fix up her mother.</i>

104
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,649
Maybe we could get Ice to cater it
or something- I don't know what I'm saying!

105
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,126
- We don't even have a body.
- I will be my father's body.

106
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
I'll be the one buried.

107
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,264
Because he loved magic
so very much.

108
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,599
- I don't think Gob knows what he's saying.
- I know exactly what I'm saying.

109
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,105
I will be buried in my father's place...

110
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,699
<i>and then, one week later,</i>
<i>I will emerge from the grave...</i>

111
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,177
in one of the greatest illusions ever!

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,216
- This about getting into <i>Poof?</i>
- I mean, how does that <i>not</i> get me a cover?

113
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,285
Buster!

114
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,878
- We can't tell him about this!
- I think the boy's been lied to enough.

115
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,355
You weren't here
for the parakeet, Oscar.

116
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,223
<i>As a child, Buster had a beloved parakeet...</i>

117
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,764
<i>who, after landing on their</i>
<i>housekeeper Rose's wig, flew away...</i>

118
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,631
<i>when she took out the trash</i>
<i>and into a transformer.</i>

119
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,263
<i>When Buster found out,</i>
<i>he destroyed the family's kitchen...</i>

120
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,900
<i>believing this to be</i>
<i>where Rosa lived.</i>

121
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,711
- Whoa.
- What are you doing home?

122
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,544
The army had half a day.

123
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,845
- Are you guys planning a party?
- Yes.

124
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:32,391
It's your father's birthday, which,
coincidentally, is... my birthday.

125
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,222
Because you're twins.

126
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,455
Well, I've got some shopping to do.

127
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,464
<i>George Michael,</i>
<i>meanwhile, hadjust been broken up with...</i>

128
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,466
<i>by his first girlfriend...</i>

129
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,695
<i>and was on his way home.</i>

130
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,977
- <i>And he went to his father for comfort.</i>
- Dad?

131
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,849
I've got some bad news.

132
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,315
What? What?
Is Ann telling everyone?

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,786
It's your grandfather.

134
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,585
- Apparently, he's dead.
- Are you okay?

135
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,750
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

136
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,420
Uh, I'm sorry.
What were you saying about Ann?

137
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,431
<i>George Michael didn't want</i>
<i>to burden his father with his break-up.</i>

138
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,367
Nothing. I just- I broke up with her.
It's no big deal.

139
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,028
- Really?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,107
- Are you okay?
- Me? I'm great.

141
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,108
- Yeah?
- I'm great.

142
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,610
Good. Yeah.
She wasn't for us.

143
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,373
No, she's- she's a great girl.

144
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,473
- For those other guys.
- You think there are other guys?

145
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,144
I don't know what I'm saying.
Come here.

146
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,122
Hey, Brother.

147
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,124
- You wanted to see me?
- Buster, yeah.

148
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,854
I need you to help me with
this illusion I'm working on.

149
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,055
Oh, for Dad's birthday.

150
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,655
Yeah. For Dad's birthday.

151
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,895
So, look, I'm gonna
get in this coffin.

152
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:55,064
What I'm gonna need you to do
is to spin it around...

153
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:59,042
to show everybody
that there's no trap door.

154
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,137
<i>Then I'm gonna escape</i>
<i>out the trap door.</i>

155
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,149
- Ooh!
- You close the trap door...

156
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,482
<i>bring in the pallbearers</i>
<i>and bury an empty box.</i>

157
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,148
So it's a <i>hoax.</i>

158
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,158
But why are you doing a coffin trick
on Dad's birthday?

159
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,989
Black humor.

160
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,725
<i>Say, "Hey, Dad, look at you.</i>
<i>You're... a year older...</i>

161
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,769
and a year closer to death."

162
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,170
Oh, yeah, I guess that's kinda funny.

163
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,368
Okay, but you have to
do a favor for me.

164
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,412
I'm not really in the army,
and I told Mom I was...

165
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,415
but I can't go to a family event
without an army uniform.

166
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,452
- Oh, yeah. I used to be a stripper.
- Strippers don't wear clothes.

167
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,043
Not at the end of the show.

168
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,180
You can wear stripper clothes
when you're not stripping?

169
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,527
You tell me.

170
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,291
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>went for a walk in the adjoining lot...</i>

171
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,866
<i>to grieve both losses in private...</i>

172
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,403
<i>and he made</i>
<i>an interesting discovery.</i>

173
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,469
- Pop-Pop?
- Hide me.

174
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,773
Don't turn in Pop-Pop.
Help Pop-Pop.

175
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,878
<i>George Michael snuck his grandfather</i>
<i>into the attic and helped him clean up.</i>

176
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,618
- Wow, they're perfect.
- Years of brushing with Glisten.

177
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,456
Listen, you can't
tell anybody I'm up here.

178
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,463
- You have to protect me.
- Yeah, I know.

179
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,658
- I just- I can't not tell my father.
- I'm your grandfather.

180
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,928
- I went through hell to get here.
- <i>He had.</i>

181
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,904
<i>After being arrested, he found a loophole</i>
<i>in the Mexican judicial system.</i>

182
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,974
I have, uh- I have money.

183
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,409
<i>The Mexican authorities...</i>

184
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,412
<i>even attempted</i>
<i>to fake his funeral...</i>

185
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,677
<i>although it was</i>
<i>a less-than-perfect deception.</i>

186
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,618
Anyway, I was halfway down to Panama,
and I saw something in the local paper.

187
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,621
<i>What he saw was a story...</i>

188
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,624
<i>about his wife giving mouth-to-mouth</i>
<i>to a homeless man.</i>

189
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,957
<i>She was kissing his brother.</i>

190
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,669
Well, I understand what that feels like.
I was dumped today.

191
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,333
I can't tell Dad how upset I am about it because
he'll think I should just be upset about you.

192
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,673
- He wouldn't be wrong.
- What?

193
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,679
Seems like we're
going through the same thing.

194
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,547
- Why don't we keep each other's secrets?
- Yeah, okay.

195
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,684
Listen, if you pass a mini-mart,
Pop-Pop gets a treat?

196
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,620
<i>The next morning...</i>

197
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,855
- <i>Michael ran into his son</i>
<i>doing something suspicious.</i>
- Morning!

198
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,988
- Hi.
- Where are you goin' with that food?

199
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,126
I was just gonna eat some of my
grandfather's favorite foods in my room.

200
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,670
It's the form that my grief is taking.

201
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,706
Okay.

202
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,178
<i>I think George Michael's</i>
<i>hiding Ann in the attic.</i>

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,180
From who, the Nazis?

204
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,978
<i>No, his girlfriend, from me.</i>

205
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,519
I just caught him
sneaking up to her in the attic...

206
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,715
and he clearly did so
because he thinks I don't approve.

207
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,725
I think I'm gonna
invite her to the wake.

208
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,557
Why make him hide? Why do to him what-

209
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,225
Why do to him
what Dad used to do to me?

210
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,235
He was so amazing.

211
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,238
That was actually an example
of how <i>not</i> so amazing he was.

212
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,570
You're really going
through something here, huh?

213
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,405
I know!

214
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,412
You know, it's funny-
all those years when I pretended to cry...

215
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,415
I used to use Dad's death
to get me going.

216
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,918
I tried it with Mom's, but I'd
just end up smiling and ruining it.

217
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,011
But it feels, like, real.
You know?

218
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,353
And you haven't really allowed yourself
to grieve much at all, Michael.

219
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,361
My relationship with Dad was much more-
much more complicated than yours.

220
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:42,457
It was predicated a lot on secrets and lies.
There wasn't a lot of trust there.

221
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,297
<i>Here he comes.</i>

222
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,371
Here comes John Wayne.

223
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,970
I'm not gonna cry about my pa.

224
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,978
I'm gonna build an airport,
put my name on it.

225
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,073
Why, Michael?
So you can fly away from your feelings?

226
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,881
<i>You can keep 'em bottled up,</i>
<i>but they will come out, Michael.</i>

227
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,388
Sometimes in the most unexpected-

228
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,722
Hey, where the-
Are my hard-boiled eggs?

229
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:22,230
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was preparing</i>
<i>for the illusion ofbeing buried alive.</i>

230
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,242
Boy, you sure
got this hole dug out quick.

231
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,245
<i>In fact, the laborer had been hired</i>
<i>by George Sr. Three days earlier...</i>

232
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,315
<i>for the same hole.</i>

233
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,750
<i>And Buster searched</i>
<i>for the perfect card.</i>

234
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,517
"Someone wanted to send you
a birthday greeting. See you soon!"

235
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,593
Oh! That is wicked.

236
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,930
<i>And soon, the wake</i>
<i>that Ice had catered began.</i>

237
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:51,298
- What are you doing? Is this what you're wearing?
- My father's dead, Maeby.

238
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,304
Yeah, but you're not,
and Ice is right there.

239
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,534
<i>Maeby knew that if she</i>
<i>could get her mother to have an affair...</i>

240
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,543
<i>she could emancipate.</i>

241
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,775
All Pop-Pop ever wanted was to see you
with another man besides Daddy.

242
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,783
You're right.

243
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,785
You know what?

244
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,550
I'm gonna throw on a skirt, take off my
underwear and make your Pop-Pop proud.

245
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,490
Let me ask Barry.
That might be enough right there.

246
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,096
Is Oscar wearing my suit?

247
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,098
Hey-

248
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,363
You tell my brother
you don't wear a dead man's pants.

249
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,701
Shame on him. And you say that to him.
You say, "Shame on you."

250
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,742
- Okay.
- Say it to me like you're gonna say it to him.

251
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,243
I'm probably not
gonna say it to him.

252
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,245
Okay.

253
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,077
Look at her down there.
Does she look sad to you?

254
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,084
- Oh, my God. That's Ann.
- Who?

255
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,586
It's the girl
who ripped my heart out...

256
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,919
the girl whose face
will always be etched in my mind.

257
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,993
Her?

258
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,595
She's really funny.

259
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,257
Well, let's hope so.

260
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,993
<i>Don't forget the chicken wings!</i>

261
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,070
Hey! Ann!
You're here. That's great.

262
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,231
- I wasn't sure whether you got my message.
- It wasn't a message.

263
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,276
- We talked.
- Uh, Ann?

264
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,246
Did Dad invite you?

265
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,511
I figured life's too short. You two care for
each other. Why throw that away? Huh?

266
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,485
Huh? Okay.

267
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,617
- Do you think we really do?
- A father can tell. Okay?

268
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,752
It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face.

269
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,763
<i>And Buster arrived...</i>

270
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,425
<i>dressed in the military outfit</i>
<i>Gob had procured for him.</i>

271
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,332
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's all regulation, Michael.

272
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,039
To get the top right,
the pants had to be a little snug.

273
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,233
To get the top right,
the pants had to be a little snug.

274
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,901
Is there a birthday gift pile?
Hmm?

275
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,910
A birthday gift pile?

276
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,379
<i>Michael recalled what Buster</i>
<i>did to what he thought was Rose's car...</i>

277
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:47,111
<i>with what he thought</i>
<i>was Rose's favorite toy.</i>

278
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,119
<i>Hey!</i>

279
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,487
- Yours is the first.
- And the most wicked.

280
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,755
Get him out of here.
We can't let him know it's a wake.

281
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,762
<i>Buster!</i>

282
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:03,301
Let's go get that coffin ready to be buried.

283
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,462
<i>And so the family</i>
<i>gathered to remember George Sr.</i>

284
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,167
<i>If anyone would</i>
<i>like to say anything about Dad...</i>

285
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,244
now's the time.

286
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,739
- Anyone.
- Anyone?

287
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,877
Perhaps my son George Michael
would like to say something.

288
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,854
Huh? Wanna share
your feelings? Eh?

289
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,120
- It's okay to cry, pal. It's okay.
- Yeah?

290
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,128
Wow.
He's really gone.

291
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:37,231
<i>But I think that ifhe</i>
<i>was here right now...</i>

292
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,295
I would probably tell him
that it all worked out...

293
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,308
<i>and</i> that, um...

294
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,846
I'll be bringing you
some salmon rolls right away...

295
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,643
in... heaven.

296
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,014
How many times
I gotta tell this kid chicken wings?

297
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,384
<i>Lindsay got up to speak</i>
<i>in an outfit her daughter had chosen.</i>

298
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,014
My father meant the world to me.

299
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,026
Wipe, Mom. Give it a wipe.

300
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,891
That's a home run.

301
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,898
<i>And finally, Michael got up to speak.</i>

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,901
I had a very complicated relationship
with my father.

303
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,497
Ice, can we- can we just cool it
on the smoothies for right now?

304
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,872
There are smoothies?

305
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,878
I could never trust my father.

306
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,143
But I always want my son
to be able to trust me...

307
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,809
so from now on...

308
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,479
we're always gonna be
honest with each other.

309
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,147
Okay?

310
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:37,217
'Cause there's nobody I love
more than you in this whole world.

311
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,098
Michael, listen, can we
move the eulogy outside...

312
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,933
so I can time being lowered into
Dad's grave with your big finish?

313
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,564
- I'm done.
- Wow. That was your eulogy?

314
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,075
Glad Dad wasn't around
to see that.

315
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,912
- That was great.
- Well, I meant it.

316
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,416
So no more secret trips
up to the attic. Right?

317
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,918
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>didn't want to betray his grandfather...</i>

318
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,888
<i>but it appeared his father</i>
<i>already knew the truth.</i>

319
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,084
- I have Pop-Pop in the attic.
- What?

320
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,219
The mere fact that you call making love
"pop-pop" tells me you're not ready.

321
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,798
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Before we lose the sun!</i>

322
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,867
Come on.

323
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,734
The speeches we heard today
are nothing more than words.

324
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,809
<i>But I will prove that I love my father</i>
<i>more than anybody.</i>

325
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,113
Buster!

326
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,585
Stop it!

327
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,232
As you can see,
this is a normal coffin.

328
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,506
Take me halfway around.

329
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,114
I will become my dead father's body...

330
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,945
<i>as I am lowered into his grave.</i>

331
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,281
- All right. Spin it back around.
- Dead father?

332
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,287
Is he de- Dad's dead?

333
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,449
Just keep it together, Buster,
and spin this back around.

334
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,027
Oh, my God!
The card! The card!

335
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,461
<i>Something's gone wrong.</i>

336
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,669
<i>How about that?</i>

337
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,134
<i>Michael noticed something in the dirt.</i>

338
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,438
Glisten.

339
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:38,482
<i>And suddenly he realized what his son meant</i>
<i>when he said he had Pop-Pop in the attic.</i>

340
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,882
Dad? Dad.

341
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,615
How you doin', Michael?

342
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,786
Uh, hey, but your father's alive, Michael.
He's alive.

343
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,831
- How could you do this to us?
- I had no choice.

344
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,833
My brother is with Lucille.
She's destroying the family.

345
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,996
You put the entire business in peril, you escape
from prison, then make us think you've died?

346
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,564
L-l-I'm an innocent man,
Michael. I'm a patsy.

347
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,873
<i>L- I signed some documents</i>-
<i>I thought they were gonna kill me.</i>

348
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,881
Don't turn me in. Okay?
Can you help me out?

349
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,884
<i>And for a moment</i>
<i>Michael was conflicted.</i>

350
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,887
Well, I'm not gonna let you stay here
and make my son an accomplice. Okay?

351
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,856
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let you
spread your guilt to him.

352
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:24,088
Ice, my mother
has something to tell you.

353
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,723
- I find you very attractive.
- She cleans up nice too. Trust me.

354
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,700
Uh, I think I'm finally off the clock.

355
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,970
I'm out of here, right?

356
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,939
Hi. Dad's alive.
He's hiding in the attic.

357
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,840
- He's upstairs?
- Oh, my God!

358
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,914
<i>Dad?</i>

359
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,619
He's gone.

360
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,690
Stack the chafing dishes outside
by the mailbox. I'm on the job.

361
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,528
I can't seem to give this away.

362
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,961
<i>I can't believe it!</i>
<i>And I just found the will!</i>

363
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,262
<i>Can someone</i>
<i>explain to me what's going on?</i>

364
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,134
<i>Thanks, Mikey.</i>

365
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,144
Yeah.
Well, now it's our secret.

366
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,912
<i>And Michael met up</i>
<i>with his son, their roles now reversed.</i>

367
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,646
I'm sorry. From now on
we'll just tell the truth to each other.

368
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,956
- We're gonna try.
- Yeah.

369
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,959
So, wait, obviously
Ann wasn't in the attic.

370
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,622
- So you actually did break up with her?
- She broke up with me.

371
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,929
The great thing is, she was so moved by what
you said tonight that we're back together.

372
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,265
- Ah!
- Yeah!

373
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,566
Oh, is that great.

374
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,870
Well, we're family,
and we stick together, huh?

375
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,172
Hmm.

376
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,976
Okay, let's go dig up your uncle.

377
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,348
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development...

378
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,616
<i>Buster finds out about</i>
<i>the death of Captain Kangaroo.</i>

379
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,291
<i>Michael grows weary</i>
<i>of caring for his father.</i>

380
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:07,354
No, Pop-Pop does not get a treat.
I just brought you a- pizza.

381
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>And Gob finally makes</i>
<i>the cover of</i> Poof <i>magazine.</i>

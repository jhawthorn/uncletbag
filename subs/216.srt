00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,878
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,617
<i>Michael came home</i>
<i>to find his brother-in-law Tobias...</i>

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,386
- <i>who'd been kicked out of</i>
<i>the house earlier that week.</i>
- How are you?

7
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,394
Good.

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,294
- Didn't I already see you today?
- Not that I know of.

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>Michael</i> had <i>seen him earlier that day...</i>

10
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,894
<i>as Tobias had been posing as an English</i>
<i>nanny named Mrs. Featherbottom.</i>

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,439
Who'd like a banger
in the mouth?

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,774
Oh, right. I forgot. Here in the States
you call it a sausage in the mouth.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,976
We just call it a sausage.
- <i>The family,</i>
<i>of course, knew it was Tobias...</i>

14
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,608
<i>but the house had</i>
<i>never been cleaner.</i>

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,381
Hello, young lady.
I haven't seen you in a week.

16
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,889
<i>Oh. Right. That means</i>
<i>Mrs. Featherbottom isn't here.</i>

17
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,586
Which means she didn't iron
my blouse...

18
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,152
which means I don't have
anything to wear for my premiere.

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,166
<i>The</i> premier-
of Canada.

20
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,634
He's going out
with my gym teacher.

21
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,228
<i>Maeby was actually</i>
<i>referring to the premiere of a film...</i>

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,399
<i>from the studio</i>
<i>where she had conned her way into a job.</i>

23
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,670
Hey, Jeff. Did you get
a chance to do coverage on...

24
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,678
<i>History In Prespective?</i>

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,238
Yeah. I looked that up.
It's a ninth grade history textbook.

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,787
Yeah. And if I don't get your report on it,
I won't be able to pass.

27
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:32,847
On it.
Because I have a feeling it's a piece of-

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,928
<i>Unfortunately, thejob was</i>
<i>wreaking havoc with her language.</i>

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,293
Maybe we just need a new-
housekeeper.

30
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,559
<i>Okay. I'm sure she would</i>
<i>have ironed it for you...</i>

31
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,795
had you told her about it before
she changed out of her bloody work clothes.

32
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,770
<i>But I am off then.</i>

33
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,105
I gotta keep him trying. That is the job.

34
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,782
Michael, what are you
doing tomorrow?

35
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,114
Having my day ruined with
whatever you're about to ask me to do.

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,122
It's my wedding anniversary,
and Oscar wants to throw me a party.

37
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,852
He is aware that
he's not married to you, right?

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,794
<i>In fact, Oscar had started to perceive</i>
<i>that Lucille was pulling away from him.</i>

39
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,298
Not now.
It's my time of the month.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,133
Not now. I don't want to risk
having a baby. It could kill me.

41
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,504
- <i>So he went to Buster for advice.</i>
- I think she misses my brother.

42
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,806
- My father?
- Yes? I mean, yes.

43
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,075
- Maybe I should throw her an anniversary party.
- Oh.

44
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,982
So when he doesn't show, she'll realize that
you were the one who was always there for us.

45
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,714
Well, I was thinking one more party,
and then I'd move out.

46
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,915
But no.
I like your plan better.

47
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,891
The only problem is we know he's-
he's around somewhere.

48
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,155
Well, he didn't return
when I lost my hand.

49
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,096
But you-
you not only embrace it...

50
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,327
but I saw you kissing it
while you thought I was sleeping.

51
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,174
<i>Who knows what goes on in</i>
<i>that pot-addled mind ofhis.</i>

52
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,736
Anyway, it's a party,
and I want the whole family there.

53
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,078
- We're havin' a party?
- No.

54
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,848
<i>Well, I'm sorry if I don't want you</i>
<i>doing one of your stupid puppet shows.</i>

55
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,914
I did that once, Mom.
And a lot of people thought it was pretty cool.

56
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,085
<i>In an effort to hip up his act...</i>

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,356
<i>Gob had briefly</i>
<i>introduced a puppet.</i>

58
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,364
- Can I tell you somethin', my man?
- Sure, Franklin.

59
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,596
<i>You are one cool</i>-

60
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:29,573
Speakin' of mothers,
let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar.

61
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,077
- Get off my wife, you bastard!
- Oh, man. What's the matter with you?

62
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,147
Franklin said some things
Whitey wasn't ready to hear.

63
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:39,207
Gob, weren't you also mercilessly beaten
outside of a club in Torrance for that act?

64
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,584
He also said some things that
African-Americany wasn't ready to hear either.

65
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,884
You know, Mom,
we have no idea where Dad is.

66
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,891
How's he gonna
hear about the party?

67
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,484
Why do you have
the baby monitor out?

68
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,724
- I'm, uh, listening in-
- She wants her man back.

69
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:56,097
- On my son.
- Yo, man. You're gonna get your
sorry white ass thrown in jail.

70
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,137
I said that's enough.

71
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,265
<i>Michael came up with an excuse</i>
<i>he knew his mother would understand.</i>

72
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,741
I'm listening in on my son.

73
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,438
I'm a little worried
about his girlfriend, Ann.

74
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,243
<i>My advice, get one of those teddy bears</i>
<i>with the cameras in them.</i>

75
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,343
I had one in Buster's room to make sure
he wasn't getting too serious with anyone.

76
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,481
As it turned out,
he got too serious with the teddy bear.

77
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,028
I'll see you
at the anniversary party.

78
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,620
- Gangy's having an anniversary party?
- Seems that way.

79
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,190
- Is Franklin gonna be there?
- See that, Mike? Kids love Franklin.

80
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,328
I just don't want him to point out
my cracker ass in front of Ann.

81
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,442
Imagine what he'd say
about her.

82
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,636
So you <i>were</i> listening in
on George Michael.

83
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,180
Can you believe
what he asked me this morning?

84
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,614
Do you think my mom's
engagement ring is still around?

85
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,551
Of course it is. Your father would never
part with something so precious.

86
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:53,456
<i>In fact, Lindsay was currently</i>
<i>wearing it on her middle toe, roast beef.</i>

87
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,857
I'm thinking of asking Ann
to get pre-engaged.

88
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,023
- You are?
- Yeah. I feel like God moved her
here from Ohio to be with me.

89
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,296
- <i>Her?</i>
- Well, that's the first I've heard of this.

90
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,839
- Well, then who said "Her?"
- Me. That was-That was me.

91
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,499
But, um, her?

92
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,975
Look, it's just a pre-engagement.
It's exciting.

93
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,705
You know,
it's young love.

94
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,748
I had it once.
A man I loved-

95
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,013
- Here's young Maeby's blouse.
- And then things took a turn somehow.

96
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,818
<i>Master Bluth.</i>
<i>I haven't seen you in a week's time.</i>

97
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,985
Actually, you tried to put a banger
in my mouth this morning.

98
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,462
Oh, was it this morn-
Well, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,331
- I'm just so exhausted.
- So I'm just gonna talk to my son.

100
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,496
I'm gonna tell him that I'm against this.
I don't like her.

101
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,574
You know, maybe if you
stop judging her, he'd trust you.

102
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,611
Look, if you say no,
you're just gonna drive him right to her.

103
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,943
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>
<i>Can you drive me to Ann's?</i>

104
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,346
N-N-N-

105
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,046
- Y-Yes.
- Great. I'll wait in the car.

106
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,452
I don't think that worked.

107
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,688
<i>Meanwhile, Gob went to check on</i>
<i>the one friend who didn't mind having him around.</i>

108
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,628
<i>Get your loser hand out of my ass.</i>

109
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,360
- Hello, Son.
- Oh, Dad. I thought- Dad?

110
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,494
This is where you've been hi- Michael.

111
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,572
I just came back
because of your mother.

112
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,198
She's with my brother
on my anniversary.

113
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,209
But I got an idea
from George Michael.

114
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,245
I need to recommit myself
to your mother.

115
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,247
- Her?
- But you gotta get me into that party.

116
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,283
Then you gotta
take me to this church.

117
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,512
I found this brochure
that Ann left behind.

118
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,088
That's gonna be tough.
I'm not really all that invited.

119
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,623
I got it all worked out,
but I need a limousine.

120
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,250
L- I can do this, Dad.
I'm gonna make you proud.

121
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,727
Never too late to start.

122
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,063
<i>And Michael drove to Ann's house,</i>
<i>where he finally got to meet Ann's parents.</i>

123
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,797
This is my father,
Pastor Terry Veal.

124
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,397
- Hello.
- Oh, Pastor. I didn't know. You didn't tell me.

125
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,409
- I told you.
- No, you didn't.

126
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,105
People treat you so differently
when they find out you're a man of God.

127
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,774
- Oh, believe me, I know.
- Oh, are you a churchgoing man?

128
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,613
I am.

129
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,654
Sometimes. Yes.
I don't go religiously.

130
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,780
I mean,
I'm not a nut about it.

131
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,191
Because there is no such thing
as a nut when it comes to religion, Pastor.

132
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,627
I've met a few.

133
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,529
I'm sure if you look a bit closer
you'll find some very earnest people...

134
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,534
that are just
doing their best.

135
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,536
<i>- What are you doin', Dad?</i>
- I'm not sure.

136
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,506
Why don't you kids run along and let us
get to know each other a bit better? Thank you.

137
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,099
- Maybe I should get my wife. Honey.
- Okay.

138
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,111
<i>This is George Michael's father.</i>

139
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,444
<i>This is your wife.</i>
<i>Didn't</i>- <i>Didn't realize you could remarry.</i>

140
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,678
- What?
- Is this Ann's mother?

141
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,947
- I'm Mrs. Veal.
- I'm sorry. I just-

142
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,387
I did not expect
somebody so young.

143
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,119
Next you're gonna say
how Ann and I can be sisters.

144
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,491
No, I'd never say that.

145
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,291
Listen, I'm here because...

146
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,061
I think my son might be planning on
asking your daughter to get pre-engaged.

147
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,329
- <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

148
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,962
Well, that is something
to celebrate.

149
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,564
Can we open up
some sparkling apple cider?

150
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,645
- No.
- Oh, did you want us to
go down to the liquor store...

151
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,645
and get you some liquor?

152
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,806
No. Don't you think
they're a bit too young?

153
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,645
Oh, we got serious
around his age.

154
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,844
Who can blame you?
You gotta lock that down.

155
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,149
But I'm not quite sure
that they're ready.

156
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,225
Michael, in my experience,
there is no recipe for a perfect match.

157
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,590
<i>It takes the love</i>
<i>of two families.</i>

158
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,856
Well, you haven't met
my family.

159
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,866
<i>And that's when Michael devised</i>
<i>a new plan to win the Veals'disapproval.</i>

160
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,402
You haven't met my family.

161
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,529
You should meet my family.

162
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,732
We're gonna be having
an anniversary party.

163
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,866
What a wonderful surprise.

164
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,912
We would love to witness
a celebration of their love.

165
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,981
That would be
a wonderful surprise.

166
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,277
<i>But he did want a little bit of insurance.</i>

167
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:43,083
Hey, Gob.
Mom wants Franklin at the party.

168
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,623
Yeah. What?

169
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,058
No, no, no. I don't want to talk-
Hey, Franklin.

170
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,465
<i>Lucille was setting up for the anniversary party...</i>

171
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,731
<i>that she didn't expect</i>
<i>her husband to attend.</i>

172
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,535
- <i>Where's the food?</i>
- Sorry. Just stuffing the mushroom.

173
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,975
<i>You realize that's Tobias,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

174
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,478
If he's gonna raid my closet,
he's gonna work for it.

175
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,210
- What happened to his ankle?
- <i>Tobias had attempted an entrance...</i>

176
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,218
<i>that he hoped</i>
<i>would enchant his daughter.</i>

177
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,381
Ohhhh!

178
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,825
We shan't be telling
your mother this, shan't we?

179
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,127
Maybe you can point out to your mother
that your father hasn't arrived yet.

180
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,263
Hmm. So, my father's
not here.

181
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,135
Maybe he is.

182
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,002
Ann just called. They had a predawn mass,
and then they're gonna go to mass, so-

183
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,083
Well, Ann's got
a great deal of mass.

184
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,153
Anyway, I hope
that the Veals like us.

185
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,313
Why don't you go top off
your Gangy? Thanks.

186
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,448
Wait a minute.
You invited the Veals?

187
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,788
Only so that they'll
disapprove of us.

188
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,089
I gotta kill this
pre-engagement somehow.

189
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,756
And after Mom's second vodka,
and after Buster's second juice box...

190
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,095
they're gonna forbid Ann
from even seeing my son...

191
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,170
much less taking his ring,
and I'm still the good guy.

192
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,332
So the devout religious family-
they're the bad guys?

193
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,501
You'll understand when Maeby
starts getting proposals.

194
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,171
<i>Actually, Maeby had given two that day.</i>

195
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,612
<i>I'm sorry. I can't read</i>
<i>what you wrote on this buck slip.</i>

196
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,877
You've got the handwriting
of a 15-year-old.

197
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,283
Fifteen-year-old.
Marry me!

198
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,391
Hey, I'm almost done with that coverage.
I can bring it to you tonight.

199
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,392
Are you still
at the Balboa Towers?

200
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,122
<i>Maeby had used her grandmother's address...</i>

201
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,130
<i>so as not to arouse</i>
<i>suspicion at home.</i>

202
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,497
<i>This required convincing the guard</i>
<i>she was several years younger than her age.</i>

203
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,503
Boy, you get a lot of mail
from that movie studio.

204
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,039
I write a lot of letters
to movie stars.

205
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,974
- You seem a little old for that.
- Babysit me.

206
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,705
<i>That place seems</i>
<i>so old for you.</i>

207
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,747
I'll send Dr. Epstein
your compliments.

208
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,340
- And may I add, marry me.
- Okay.

209
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:56,080
<i>And Maeby realized</i>
<i>she might be in need of a new deflection.</i>

210
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,713
<i>Hi, Mrs. Veal. Welcome.</i>

211
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,849
Mom, this is Ann's mother.

212
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,860
Are you sure
this isn't her sister?

213
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,557
- What a lovely thing to say.
- That's an awful thing to say, Mom. Please.

214
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,566
I'm so eager
to meet your husband.

215
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,502
Yeah. Dad escaped from prison.
Did you not know that?

216
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,166
<i>In fact, George Sr. Had</i>
<i>just been picked up by his son.</i>

217
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:20,006
Oh, great. It's stuck. All right.
Just stay down and let me handle this.

218
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,080
Is that Mr. Bluth there?

219
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,207
He's got us, Dad.
Come on out.

220
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,911
<i>He's talking to you,</i>
<i>you idiot. Cover.</i>

221
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,011
I ain't your daddy!

222
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,216
How's it goin', brother?

223
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,556
You want to pop the trunk
and roll the windows down, please?

224
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,628
I'm just messin' with you. Hey, Franklin.
How you doin', little man?

225
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,267
So I'm afraid Ann's
with my husband.

226
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,435
He had a last-minute
vow renewal at the chapel.

227
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,480
<i>A call that was made by George Sr.</i>

228
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,209
How do we get her to the church?
Tell her you're in here?

229
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,911
No. Cover her eyes
and take her to the limo.

230
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,786
No. Bring her in here, knock her out with this
ether, and you stuff her into this garment bag.

231
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,121
Anyone sees, you do the same.
Oh, hi, Tobias.

232
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,127
Oh.

233
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,721
Whenever I get a wee bit scared
I hum a little tune

234
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,733
Hum diddle diddly
Hum di-do

235
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,497
You put a handkerchief over her mouth
for a couple of seconds.

236
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,629
No more than two though.
'Cause you could kill her.

237
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,298
- I don't have a handkerchief.
- Fine.

238
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,809
Put the ether on the puppet's lips.
Have the puppet kiss her.

239
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,902
I ain't kissin'
that old bitch.

240
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,072
That's my wife, you bastard!

241
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,173
Dad, that's my wrist!

242
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,583
Hey, man! That's his neck!

243
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,851
Hey, Gob. Mrs. Veal,
this is my brother Gob.

244
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,449
- Where's your pal Franklin?
- Throat's a little sore.

245
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,028
And wrist.
Nice to meet you.

246
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,155
What a lovely family.

247
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,699
Does it seem that way?
Where's Buster?

248
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,769
Should help.

249
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,839
It's really great you did this.
I thought you didn't even like Ann.

250
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,669
But since you do, I thought maybe
I could get your opinion.

251
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,040
I was thinking of giving her, like,
a pre-engagement-

252
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,477
- Ring?
- Ah.

253
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,447
Wow. That catches me off guard,
George Michael. I'm not sure about that.

254
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,848
I don't know if it's-

255
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,886
I think it's gonna
backfire on you.

256
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,082
I think it could backfire on you
because it's gonna seem...

257
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,716
like you're taking marriage,
uh, lightly, you know.

258
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,352
And you can't.
It's very sacred.

259
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,261
- Sacred.
- Yeah. That's it.

260
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,266
All right.
Well, yeah.

261
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,268
You know, it did kind of
feel right to me.

262
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,032
- But, yeah. I've gotta trust you, right?
- Thank you. Thank you.

263
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,369
Damn. Maybe I should-

264
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,809
Maybe I should ask if she wants to get
pre-pre-engaged. Add another-

265
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,881
The mere fact that you're
laughing about marriage...

266
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,245
- means that you're not ready, okay?
- Wha-

267
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,875
<i>And Lucille was asked to the kitchen.</i>

268
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,979
What's so important that you're dragging me
away from this miserable party?

269
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,821
Well, I just had an old friend
who wanted to tell you...

270
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,556
how much I miss you!

271
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,156
Oh, who let this little black-

272
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,030
Hey, Brother.

273
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,832
- Who you callin' brother, you hook-ass-
- Mother!

274
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,173
What the hell kind of puppet
does Buster have on his hand?

275
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,269
Just let me think.

276
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,348
God, Franklin.
Your breath- Oh, God.

277
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,747
<i>So I'm really getting excited</i>
<i>about your proposal.</i>

278
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,717
Oh, yeah.
I'm not gonna do it now.

279
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,118
Because Ann's mom doesn't approve
of our family? Come on.

280
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,691
It's just some stupid plan
your father was trying.

281
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,919
Plan?

282
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,358
What plan?

283
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,430
Well, it's off. Sorry.

284
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,522
I know that you were
excited about it.

285
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,363
But, uh, you know,
in the secular world...

286
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,369
I feel like
they're a bit young.

287
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,703
You know, l- I didn't want to say anything
in front ofTerry, but I agree.

288
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,176
I mean, perhaps there's someone else
they're meant to meet.

289
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,907
Well, let's- let's just say
that in the secular world...

290
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,109
one finds oneself
with their fair share of temptations.

291
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,652
Not that anyone
would ever act-

292
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,551
Take me.

293
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,556
- Mrs. Veal.
- Take me to your secular world.

294
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,558
<i>Hey. Hey, listen.</i>

295
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,720
I can't believe my dad. First he's saying
I need to respect the sanctity of marriage...

296
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,730
then he's making out with her
on the balcony.

297
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,562
- I thought he didn't even like Ann.
- No, no. Mrs. Veal.

298
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,761
Know what else he's not gonna like?
I'm getting pre-engaged.

299
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,498
- God, that's so romantic.
- The hell with him.

300
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,972
Take it.
Take the sacred ring.

301
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,137
Not the snake.
That doesn't come off.

302
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,085
<i>Michael hadjust been kissed</i>
<i>by the mother ofhis son's girlfriend.</i>

303
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,156
- Oh, my golly!
- Listen.

304
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,590
- Don't do this. Don't do this.
- I can't believe we're making love.

305
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,653
- What are you talking about?
We're not making love.
- I want to please you secularly.

306
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,428
- We're not gonna do this.
- But you kept telling me how beautiful I was.

307
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,969
I was surprised
because of Ann.

308
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,595
- Well-
- Why because of Ann?

309
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,800
Because of
<i>an</i> old wives' tale.

310
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,934
- Oh, I'm so ashamed.
- All right. No-

311
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,979
Mrs. Veal.

312
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,948
Jolly news, governor.
Young master's proposing.

313
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,020
George Michael?
I told him not to. He said he wouldn't.

314
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,352
Well, this was before he saw you
pounding that sweet piece of veal.

315
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,451
- He saw that? Where is he?
- Oh, he left with Lady Lindsay-

316
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,861
- Tobias, where are they?
- It is me. It's Tobias.

317
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,001
- What happened?
- <i>What's going on?</i>

318
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,469
<i>Gob made me kiss Franklin.</i>
<i>I think my father was here.</i>

319
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,699
Maybe he still is.

320
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,708
Shut up. What do you mean
he was here?

321
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,210
I think he was
dragging my mother out with Gob.

322
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,610
- Oh, you shut up.
- What's goin' on?

323
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,309
<i>We're tryin'to figure that out.</i>
<i>Apparently Pop-Pop kidnapped Gangy...</i>

324
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,715
and I have no idea where George Michael is-
or Lindsay.

325
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,812
I just saw them drive off.
They're gonna go look for Bland.

326
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,084
- Who's the hottie?
- This is Ann's mother.

327
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,318
Her?

328
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,088
Does she look old enough
to play Topher Grace's mom?

329
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,494
- Where did you say Ann was?
- At the chapel.

330
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,500
Yeah, we gotta get down there.
My son's gonna pre-propose to your daughter.

331
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,368
<i>Fortunately,</i>
<i>Tobias had rented a car to maintain his ruse.</i>

332
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,373
I had this shipped over
from "Blackstool."

333
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,444
It's what I used to drive
the Roger Moores about in.

334
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,012
<i>And Lucille awoke, half in the bag.</i>

335
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,412
What am I doing
in a Nordstrom bag?

336
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,680
It's me. I'm taking you
to renew our vows.

337
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,755
- But first-
- Uh, Dad-

338
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,689
- <i>we make love.</i>
- The partition doesn't go
all the way up, remember?

339
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,818
No. No. After your vows.

340
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,692
I want to know you won't
run out on me again.

341
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,427
- I need to know you're in it for keeps.
- Just let me see 'em.

342
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,232
- Seriously, Dad. The radio doesn't work either.
<i>- George!</i>

343
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,637
<i>Gob raced his parents to the church...</i>

344
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,902
<i>passing George Michael</i>
<i>and Lindsay...</i>

345
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,638
<i>who were soon followed</i>
<i>by Mrs. Featherbottom.</i>

346
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,839
Oh, mercy me!

347
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,212
I keep forgetting
I'm in the colonies.

348
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,775
<i>Buster was talking to</i>
<i>the police when Oscar found a clue.</i>

349
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,913
They must be going
to this church.

350
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,548
He's going to renew
his vows.

351
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,890
He's my twin brother.
I know how he thinks.

352
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,055
They're at
the Church of the Good Shepherd.

353
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,532
<i>And at the chapel, Pastor Veal was officiating.</i>

354
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,001
"...to love and honor
your spirit and flesh.

355
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,937
"First the flesh.
I will caress and tweak.

356
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,769
"I will nibble and bite.

357
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,641
<i>I will blow alternatingly</i>
<i>hot and cool."</i>

358
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,943
Oh, man.
I can't wait to get married.

359
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,745
<i>Ann went to cool down,</i>
<i>where George Michael found her.</i>

360
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,752
<i>Ann, I have something</i>
<i>to ask you.</i>

361
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,754
Well, l- I really like you.

362
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,950
I guess what l- I want to ask you is,
will you one day...

363
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,754
uh, intend to marry me?

364
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,456
It would be great to hear back on this
before the real hard A.P. Stuff kicks in.

365
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,624
Let's do it. Now.

366
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,201
- Let's actually get married.
- Right now?

367
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,863
My father's in there.
He can do it as soon as he finishes.

368
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:31,204
"I'll always be here for you
to rest your ankles upon my shoulders."

369
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,278
<i>And Michael showed up at the chapel.</i>

370
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,278
Uh, listen, buddy. Dad?

371
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,314
Uh, faster, Pastor.

372
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,011
<i>Stop this!</i>
<i>Stop this now!</i>

373
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,715
<i>Oscar charged at George Sr.,</i>
<i>finally willing to fight for Lucille.</i>

374
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,815
<i>But they did think alike...</i>

375
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,292
<i>and neither could</i>
<i>land a blow.</i>

376
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,222
Dad, do us.
We're ready to get married.

377
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,597
George Michael,
don't do this just to get back at me.

378
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,365
What you saw on the balcony-
Uh, Mrs. Veal started kissing me.

379
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,702
<i>This part of it was news to George Michael.</i>

380
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,777
<i>Unfortunately, it was</i>
<i>also news to Pastor Veal.</i>

381
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,403
- You kissed my wife?
- No. She started kissing me.

382
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,414
You really should
lock that down.

383
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>And Pastor Veal, too,</i>
<i>was ready to fight for the woman he loved.</i>

384
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,250
Ah. Finally.
Where have you been?

385
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,851
<i>The police had been delayed when they</i>
<i>thought they'd cornered a kidnapping suspect.</i>

386
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,227
Put your hands up, or we'll take that
as a sign of aggression against us.

387
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,732
They're not up!
He's aggressive!

388
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,702
- <i>Got a little hot out there.</i>
- Well, it's getting pretty hot in here.

389
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,069
<i>- She's mine!</i>
- No. She's mine.

390
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,541
<i>Oscar, I don't want her.</i>
<i>I don't want either of them.</i>

391
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,839
Oh. Sorry.
Where's my brother?

392
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,005
Look at all the bobbies.

393
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,175
<i>Oh, no. My wig</i>
<i>seems to have run off.</i>

394
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,446
<i>On George Sr., as it turned out.</i>

395
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,225
- Who is this guy?
- This guy is my husband.

396
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,022
<i>Terry, I don't know what happened.</i>

397
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,122
I fell under the spell
of that horrible secular family.

398
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,201
Forgive me.

399
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,533
<i>Could've used that horrible</i>
<i>family stuff about a halfhour ago.</i>

400
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,766
I hope you notice
I didn't run.

401
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,311
- You fought for me.
- What I meant to say is l- I think I broke my ankle.

402
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,576
Let's alternate
hot and cool on that.

403
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,214
- Guess the wedding's off?
- Yeah. That's okay, Dad.

404
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,484
We were talking, and we think that
we were doin' it for the wrong reasons.

405
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,459
Yeah? You have so much to experience before
you make a commitment you're not ready for.

406
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,392
You need to get to
know each other better...

407
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,556
and then you can be comfortable
going all the way with it.

408
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,067
- Do you mean it?
- Yes. This time I'm being honest with you.

409
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,900
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

410
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,739
It sounds like your father just
gave us permission to start doing it.

411
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,005
You must teach me,
George Michael.

412
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,412
You must teach me
the ways of the secular flesh.

413
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,916
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

414
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,923
That doesn't bother you.

415
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,256
<i>Buster finds someone else</i>
<i>interested in kissing his hook.</i>

416
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,297
- Oh, God!
- Drug dog's got something. Get him, Bennett!

417
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,662
<i>So Buster gets a hook replacement.</i>

418
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,258
They're not gonna let you in
at the country club with that.

419
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,998
I don't want no part
of your tight-ass country club...

420
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,199
you freak bitch!

1
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,693
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:09,795
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,973
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:23,083
<i>Michael Bluth</i>
<i>was visiting his father in prison...</i>

6
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:25,882
<i>anxious to get to the bottom</i>
<i>of some mysterious bookkeeping.</i>

7
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,923
It just doesn't make
any sense, Dad.

8
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:31,084
Where did this money come from? Why did
it end up in the international accounts file?

9
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:34,493
<i>George Sr. was also anxious,</i>
<i>but less about the bookkeeping.</i>

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:37,624
This game is never gonna happen.
Half of these guys are still in their cuffs.

11
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,895
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but I'm trying to get you out of here.

12
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,666
Well, I'm trying to get us out of last place,
Michael. We're playing Rahway next week.

13
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,674
Word has it that
they're getting Jose Canseco.

14
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:49,574
I'm starting to wonder
why I even bother coming.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,408
- <i>Bluth! Right field!</i>
- That is ridiculous.

16
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:54,814
- You won't even talk to me!
- I'm catcher, or I'm nothing!

17
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,278
<i>Michael returned to work...</i>

18
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:01,585
<i>where his assistant, Kitty,</i>
<i>greeted him with some startling news.</i>

19
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:03,488
Your wife's on line one.

20
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:06,494
<i>Michael's wife</i>
<i>had been dead for two years.</i>
- My what?

21
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:09,497
- <i>Kitty realized her mistake.</i>
- I said, your wife is on line one.

22
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,760
<i>But not immediately.</i>

23
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,802
Oh! Oh, God.

24
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:17,101
I'm sorry.
George's wife. Your mother.

25
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,108
I'm so used to being
George's assistant.

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,270
<i>Kitty had been George Sr. 's</i>
<i>fiercely loyal assistant for years.</i>

27
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:31,619
<i>And Michael suspected that</i>
<i>she had the information he needed.</i>

28
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:34,781
Hey, Kitty, listen,
you wouldn't know...

29
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,621
if we had any documentation on
these international accounts, would you?

30
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:40,992
That's actually not
any of your business.

31
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:44,191
<i>My</i> business.
That's not any of <i>my</i> business.

32
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:48,468
Hey, Mom.

33
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:51,473
Are you aware we've been downgraded
to being just pool members at the club now?

34
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,305
Yeah, it's a real shame
what's going on with this family.

35
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:57,869
You're stuck by the pool,
and Dad's getting picked last for softball.

36
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,473
Nonetheless, you can free up a little company
money to get back our golf privileges.

37
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,849
No, I can't.
Mom, you don't even play golf.

38
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:07,355
No, but I use the clubhouse dining room...
until I was turned away today.

39
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,857
It's embarrassing... Take it back!

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,124
If I wanted something your thumb touched,
I'd eat the inside of your ear!

41
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,165
You should see
the looks I'm getting.

42
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:21,669
If you can't free up the cash,
have your father call the club president.

43
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:25,172
I've got news for you, Mom...
I'm not visiting Dad in jail anymore.

44
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,334
No, I've had it.

45
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:30,709
I'm down there every single day trying to do
what I can to get this company back on track...

46
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:33,112
and he barely even acknowledges me.

47
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,116
That is disgusting!

48
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:39,177
Talk to your father.
I will not stand for this!

49
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:43,550
Gob!

50
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,255
Can I, uh... get you
to stop doing that?

51
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,264
I'm just setting up an office.

52
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,598
Gotta write a strongly worded letter
to one Warden James Buck.

53
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:56,604
<i>In order to restore</i>
<i>his career as an escape artist...</i>

54
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:59,800
<i>Gob had recently checked into prison</i>
<i>as a publicity stunt.</i>

55
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,709
- You really think you can
break out of my prison?
- You won't even know I was here.

56
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,781
<i>But after a shiv to his side...</i>

57
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,112
<i>Gob was rushed</i>
<i>to a local hospital...</i>

58
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:12,154
- <i>thus fulfilling, in Gob's mind,</i>
<i>his contract with the public.</i>
-? Ta-dah?

59
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:16,055
<i>And yet the warden had refused to</i>
<i>acknowledge the legitimacy of the escape.</i>

60
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,118
So I am going after this guy
with everything I've got...

61
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,130
art.

62
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,757
Now we are writing a letter.

63
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:27,302
<i>Gob?</i>

64
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:31,272
<i>I wish I would've known</i>
<i>you were coming. I am a mess.</i>

65
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,342
Don't know if a call from me
would've changed that.

66
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,775
Do you like my outfit?

67
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,473
Not as much as I like
what's underneath it.

68
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,481
Gob!

69
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,019
No, I need your chair. Get up.
I've got a letter to write.

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,020
Whoo!
You're all business.

71
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,590
just like your dad.

72
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,559
My God, she's repulsive.

73
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:55,290
<i>Michael realized</i>
<i>that Kitty's obvious attraction to Gob...</i>

74
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,298
<i>could perhaps be of use to him.</i>

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,265
How would you like
a touch lamp?

76
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,269
You're the one
who needs therapy!

77
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:04,636
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias prepared</i>
<i>for their first session with a therapist.</i>

78
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,141
Yes, Tobias,
I want the marriage to work.

79
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:09,643
I just don't know
if therapy is the answer.

80
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:12,772
Because you didn't respect my old career,
and you certainly don't respect my new one!

81
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,782
You don't <i>have</i> a new one!

82
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:18,479
<i>Things had been tense</i>
<i>since Tobias left his psychiatry practice...</i>

83
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:20,818
<i>to pursue an acting career.</i>

84
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,761
- I have needs, you know.
- And how I am not addressing your needs?

85
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:29,958
- How can you even ask that? What is this?
- Oh! Go right to that!

86
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,126
Good. Go right there.
Real mature. Really great.

87
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:37,969
Okay, kids, Mommy and Daddy
are going out for ice cream.

88
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:42,033
- Can we come?
- Sorry. It's not for kids.

89
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:47,311
- Now we <i>have</i> to follow them.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,147
What?

91
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:53,416
Okay, so, why are we doing this?

92
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:56,390
'Cause it's obvious they're lying.
Come on, drive!

93
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:59,485
- Well, what if they see us?
- How are they gonna see us?

94
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,860
It says "Bluth Company"
right on the side.

95
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:05,332
Plus, it's a stairway.
That's gonna catch the eye.

96
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,733
<i>The airport stairway vehicle...</i>

97
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,000
<i>was the last vestige</i>
<i>of the Bluths'former wealth.</i>

98
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:14,770
<i>Also, that House of Pies</i>
<i>that went out ofbusiness.</i>

99
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,176
You are scared. I knew it.

100
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,681
No, I'm not scared.
It's just that... I have plans later.

101
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,684
l-I'm visiting Pop-Pop.

102
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,845
You visit Pop-Pop?

103
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:28,014
<i>In fact, he'd been terrified</i>
<i>of the very notion of prison...</i>

104
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:31,150
<i>since, as a young boy,</i>
<i>he accidentally watched HBO's</i> Oz...

105
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,991
<i>mistaking it for the classic</i>
<i>Judy Garland musical.</i>

106
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:36,395
- <i>I'm an innocent man!</i>
- <i>Eat it, bitch!</i>

107
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:39,024
- Lots of times.
- What's it like?

108
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,434
You know what you should do?
You should go get your mom's date book.

109
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,440
Oh, yeah. She must have written down
where they're going.

110
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,739
- I still wanna hear about prison, okay?
- If you can handle it.

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,246
<i>Michael arrived home in a good mood.</i>

112
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,749
<i>With Gob getting</i>
<i>the information from Kitty...</i>

113
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:58,685
<i>he would no longer have to visit prison</i>
<i>and deal with his father.</i>

114
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,313
<i>Hey, buddy!</i>
<i>Came home early.</i>

115
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,892
Wanna do somethin'?
Anything. Anything at all.

116
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:06,826
I wanna visit Pop-Pop in prison.

117
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,733
<i>Back at the office, Gob was</i>
<i>making progress with Michael's assistant.</i>

118
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:18,001
Here's where we keep all of our...
heavyweight paper.

119
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,837
Bet you can show me
where a lot of things are.

120
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:26,280
What kind of things
are you... looking for?

121
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:29,112
What, uh...
What are you hiding?

122
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,744
Nothing you can't find.

123
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,347
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.
Take off your glasses.

124
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,427
Oh.

125
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,828
Wait, wait.
Let down your hair.

126
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:51,197
No. Glasses on. Hair back up.
Let's just get that hair right back up.

127
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:54,208
- Do you want me to turn all the lights off?
- Yes, yes, please.

128
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,278
How's that? Is that better?

129
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,939
There's still light coming in
from under the door.

130
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:01,278
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>were, for the first time...</i>

131
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:02,783
<i>addressing</i>
<i>their marital problems.</i>

132
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:05,116
It's like we're face to face now...

133
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:08,850
<i>like we're really</i>
<i>seeing this marriage and...</i>

134
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,256
I'm afraid it's a lie.

135
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:19,802
Bravo. If I gave a performance that good,
I'd have my own <i>Alias</i> type show.

136
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:24,465
Stop it. I am so sick of hearing
about acting, acting, acting!

137
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:27,372
Okay, okay, look,
maybe we need a new approach.

138
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:31,311
Um... let's try
some role playing.

139
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,814
Yes! All right.

140
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,518
<i>Michael headed back to the prison...</i>

141
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,020
<i>despite his earlier vow</i>
<i>never to return.</i>

142
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:43,149
<i>You always say family first.</i>
<i>I should see my grandpa, right?</i>

143
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,820
I'm not stopping you.
It's just, after this I'm not going back there.

144
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,830
Why? Is it scary?

145
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,832
Scary? No. No.

146
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:54,165
It's the opposite of scary.
It's like a carnival.

147
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,900
Without the half-person on the skateboard
that grabbed your knee to steady himself.

148
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:03,206
<i>It's like a country club. All the guy does</i>
<i>is eat ice cream and play softball all day.</i>

149
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:08,080
<i>In fact, George Sr. 's</i>
<i>softball game had taken most of the day.</i>

150
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:11,085
<i>It was the 14th inning,</i>
<i>and tensions were running a little high.</i>

151
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:16,215
I'll give you a thousand bucks, you call
the next one a strike. My knees are killing me.

152
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,794
<i>No batter! No batter here!</i>

153
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:22,524
- Strike three!
- Strike three, my ass!

154
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,759
Ohh!

155
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,358
Down in the yard!

156
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,961
No batter.
No... No batter.

157
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:32,041
No... Shh.

158
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:36,677
<i>Okay, there he is.</i>
<i>Go on in there and surprise him.</i>

159
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,179
I'm gonna go get us
a few ice cream sandwiches.

160
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:41,273
Go on. Go on.

161
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,111
Hey, Pop-Pop.

162
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:49,885
- How's prison?
- I'm gonna die in here.

163
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:52,086
What?

164
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:54,095
They're gonna kill Grandpa.

165
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:57,098
I gotta... I gotta get outta here.
I'm an innocent man.

166
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,658
You gotta help Pop-Pop get outta here.
Give me your hair.

167
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,635
- My hair?
- Give Pop-Pop your hair!

168
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:06,641
- No touching! No touching! No touching!
- Give me the hair!

169
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:10,907
One of these got smooshed,
but don't let that ruin prison for you.

170
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:14,506
No batter.
No batter. No batter.

171
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:22,155
<i>Come on, baby!</i>
<i>Throw the ball!</i>

172
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:25,159
I'm sure your grandfather was just kidding
around. You know his sense of humor.

173
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,161
I know, I know. Yeah.

174
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:30,721
I don't... I don't totally get the hair joke,
but I'm fine, Dad.

175
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,824
Are you sure?

176
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:37,167
I am gonna head back in, though. I'm gonna
see if Pop-Pop's got any more zingers.

177
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:40,174
Just stay out here and relax, pal.

178
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:43,245
Watch the softball game.
I'll be right back.

179
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,749
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

180
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,922
Dad?

181
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,927
just don't like prison anymore.

182
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,930
That's why I'm trying
to get you out of here.

183
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:06,126
Maybe I've been in denial,
but this place is breaking me, Mikey...

184
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,430
and I'm alone here, but for you.

185
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,938
Come on.
You got me, you got Mom.

186
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,531
Your mother's never shown her face.

187
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:15,543
Whoa.
She's never been here?

188
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,614
You should've heard the grief she gave me
when I said I'd never show up again.

189
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:20,944
You said... You said what?

190
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,542
Dad, you don't need me.
You're playing softball all the time.

191
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,952
I <i>do</i> need you, Michael!

192
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:28,956
- No more softball.
- This is nuts.

193
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,959
You're her husband. The least she could do
is come out and visit you.

194
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,724
God, you know your mom. This isn't her crowd.
She's very easily threatened.

195
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,732
You remember the carjacker?

196
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,738
- Aaah!
- Well, she's certainly toughened up since then.

197
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,741
She's eating lunch by the pool now.

198
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:49,676
There's a big difference between
the country club pool and the conjugal trailer.

199
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,009
That's not what I meant
when I said "visit."

200
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,515
It's too bad.
I really miss that personal contact.

201
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:57,518
It was the one thing
that calmed me when I got stressed.

202
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,987
It just felt... humanizing.

203
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,990
<i>Michael, for the first time...</i>

204
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:06,061
<i>saw his father</i>
<i>as a vulnerable human being.</i>

205
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,925
Daddy horny, Michael.

206
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:14,431
I just haven't had sex in a month.

207
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:17,796
You've been here <i>two</i> months.

208
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:20,307
It's hard to gauge time.

209
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:22,206
Yeah, I'll bet.

210
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,711
Hey, Mom. I went to visit Dad today.

211
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,715
Quick question. How long
does it take you to get out there?

212
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,375
Oh, I've never been.

213
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,783
Then why does he tell me
that you've never been?

214
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,947
Ooh. Sorry, Michael.

215
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:37,184
Pool food. My system's
not used to curly fries.

216
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,628
How can you ignore that man?

217
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,221
He's having a hard time in there.
He's lonely.

218
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,232
That's what his children are for.

219
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,303
Yeah, well, you know...

220
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,565
there are certain things that...

221
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,971
he can't get from his children.

222
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:56,169
If you're going to say "pride," you're wrong.
He is proud of his children.

223
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,474
Wasn't gonna say pride, Mom.

224
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:02,483
Uh, listen, l-l-I think that, um...

225
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:05,145
I think that you should...

226
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,654
Oh, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

227
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,657
I think that you should...

228
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,659
visit him...

229
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,821
in an... intimate...

230
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:18,332
marital... trailer.

231
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:22,694
Are you mad?

232
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:26,571
You think I'm comfortable asking you
to do this? He needs you, Mom.

233
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:28,644
Did he say that?

234
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,812
Did he say that he misses me?

235
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,848
Does he need his wife's embrace?

236
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,850
Daddy horny, Michael.

237
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:38,216
He said some wonderful things.

238
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,415
You really want this for him,
don't you?

239
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:42,957
I do.

240
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,857
"Golf membership" want it?

241
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,198
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>were getting to the heart...</i>

242
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,859
<i>of each other's vulnerabilities</i>
<i>with a role-reversal exercise.</i>

243
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:54,766
- Because I'm a woman!
- Good.

244
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,770
- With a woman's needs.
- Louder.

245
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:59,534
<i>And a woman's urges!</i>
<i>And these, Tobias.</i>

246
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:03,043
When was the last time
you looked at these?

247
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:05,045
Yeah, okay.
How long is this session?

248
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:08,048
See, she's breaking in and out of character
and making it difficult...

249
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,050
'Cause I don't wanna be in a character.

250
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:13,883
Okay, let me stop you guys.
All right? Please. Let me get in here.

251
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,322
Thank you.
God.

252
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:22,727
- You've never been a real wife to me, Lindsay.
- That's not true!

253
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,598
A man is looking back at you.
A man with dreams and aspirations!

254
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:30,160
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby found an</i>
<i>address in her mother's appointment book...</i>

255
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:33,902
<i>and was getting closer to learning</i>
<i>what her parents were up to.</i>

256
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,642
Right! If I'm no Schwimmer,
you're noJennifer Aniston!

257
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:43,276
<i>Maybe I'm not even Lisa Kudrow.</i>

258
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,752
l-I have dreams, Lindsay.

259
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,323
Dreams, Lindsay.

260
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,526
Well, then, Tobias...

261
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,765
follow those dreams.

262
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,767
Make those dreams happen.

263
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,599
Yes. I will.

264
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,263
And scene!

265
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,203
- Wow!
- Okay.

266
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:12,611
- I'm sorry I stepped on your line.
- No, not at all.

267
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:16,116
- Did that answer some questions for you?
- Yeah, I think it did.

268
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,618
Now there are two men
I wanna leave.

269
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:23,957
<i>Michael arrived home, happy</i>
<i>to have a brother to share his burden with.</i>

270
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,223
- <i>Great news.</i>
- Oh, good. I could use it.

271
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,992
I just came from convincing Mom
to have sex with Dad.

272
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,626
God! What is wrong with you?
That is disgusting!

273
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:35,863
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:39,600
But just the thought
of Mom and Dad together...

275
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,870
I have a sense of propriety.
All right?

276
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:43,877
Fine.
What's your great news?

277
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:45,537
I Kitty.

278
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:48,879
Oh, Gob, I just wanted you
to get the information.

279
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:51,851
Oh, I got the information.

280
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:55,014
You did, huh?
About the international accounts?

281
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:59,760
I see what you're getting at.
No, I didn't get any information.

282
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:02,990
That's great. Good, good, good, Gob.
You just lost the touch lamp.

283
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,999
- What? No!
- The deal's off.

284
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:08,502
I'm gonna use the touch lamp to
set the mood in the conjugal trailer
when Dad's nailing Mom!

285
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,401
No! Don't... Michael!

286
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,337
<i>You are filthy!</i>

287
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:16,308
<i>The two cousins reunited...</i>

288
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:19,677
<i>each a little shaken by what they</i>
<i>had pretended to be fearless about.</i>

289
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:22,046
- You think they'll get divorced?
- <i>I don't care.</i>

290
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:25,552
I'm not saying "I don't care" like kids who say
they don't when they do... 'cause I don't.

291
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,622
Right. I know.
Who cares, right?

292
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,657
- I mean, I <i>care.</i>
- How could you not?

293
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,820
You know, our family's
really messed up.

294
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,056
I know.
We're the only normal ones.

295
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,998
At least we got
each other. Right?

296
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,601
George Michael?

297
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,612
Sorry.

298
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:55,616
Sometimes I don't know if it's gonna be
a long or short hug or a middle-medium hug.

299
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,618
It's hard to tell sometimes.

300
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,984
That was a good hug.
That's plenty for now.

301
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,989
Hug's gotta end sometime, obviously.

302
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:05,288
<i>Soon, Michael</i>
<i>was driving Lucille to prison...</i>

303
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:08,090
<i>and she seemed to be</i>
<i>looking forward to it.</i>

304
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:10,165
Where are we going after?

305
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,437
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Michael!</i>

306
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,803
What are you doing here?

307
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:22,435
You needed my help, and it was hard for you
to ask, so I took it upon myself to bring her.

308
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:25,981
- That doesn't make you uncomfortable?
- The drive <i>was</i> a little awkward.

309
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:29,642
Not every son
would do this for his father.

310
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:31,720
Thank you for this.

311
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,425
<i>Hello, George.</i>

312
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,620
What the hell's
your mother doing in here?

313
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:43,562
- Who were you expecting?
- Oh, I've done a bad thing.

314
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,327
I've done a terrible thing.

315
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:48,335
- There's someone else in
that trailer, isn't there?
- I've done a repulsive thing.

316
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:49,802
Wait... Whoa. It's Kitty?

317
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,867
- Shh!
- How long?

318
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,409
- When did this start?
- Oh, come on! This is the first time.

319
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,572
Every Friday for the last eight years.

320
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,481
- Daddy...
- Horny. I got that.

321
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,487
Hey, wait a minute.
This is easy. This is an easy one.

322
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,183
I'll go in there with Kitty,
I'll do my thing...

323
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,988
and th-th-then I'll go and see your moth...
This is a hard one.

324
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,063
- She's your secretary.
- You're right.

325
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:17,189
Family first.

326
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,529
Take care of Kitty.
Michael.

327
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,603
I need you now.

328
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:25,071
"International accounts" need me?

329
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,074
<i>And so an agreement was made.</i>

330
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:28,871
<i>George Sr.</i>
<i>would reveal the truth...</i>

331
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:32,345
<i>and Michael would make sure</i>
<i>Kitty didn't come out of the trailer.</i>

332
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,678
Yeah?

333
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:36,876
I need you to come to the prison.

334
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:39,420
- I'm at the prison.
- You're here?

335
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:43,253
I'm delivering
this strongly worded letter I wrote...

336
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,520
lit by nothing but natural light.

337
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:48,722
Well, how would you like
that touch lamp <i>and</i> the office...

338
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:53,359
<i>and</i>... what the hell...
full use of the secretary?

339
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:59,233
Thank you for doing this.
It means a... It means a lot.

340
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,572
I, uh... Okay,
I'll get down on the couch.

341
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:06,045
I'm not going to have sex
with you, George.

342
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,447
I came to tell you how much I hate you
for what you've done to this family.

343
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:11,884
- You're angry.
- You've ruined us.

344
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:15,889
<i>I've ruined us?</i>
<i>You got a lot of nerve, honey.</i>

345
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:19,449
The millions you pissed away on clothing
and jewelry and spa treatments...

346
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:23,157
Yes, to keep you interested in the only thing
you ever appreciated... my body.

347
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,392
Can I help it
if you've got a fantastic body?

348
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:29,335
And you're as powerful as a bear.

349
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,565
My husband the bear.

350
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:36,008
This bear needs
some honey, wife.

351
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:39,239
Oh, God, I missed you!

352
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:42,579
<i>Gob, meanwhile, stalled</i>
<i>to keep Kitty in the other trailer.</i>

353
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,084
Glasses off.

354
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,483
Glasses on.

355
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:47,419
Hair up.

356
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,423
Glasses off.

357
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,517
Down, on.
Have we done up, off?

358
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,823
- Oh, Gob, this is so wrong.
- <i>And bright.</i>

359
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,831
Wrong a-and bright.

360
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,924
This...

361
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,435
That's be... brighter!

362
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:04,438
God! Damn.

363
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm just gonna wash up
real quick.

364
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,969
Uh, I think I'm gonna go with...
with down and off.

365
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,047
<i>Gob had to do the right thing.</i>

366
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:19,277
<i>But as he headed to his car,</i>
<i>he ran into the warden...</i>

367
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,481
<i>who hadjust read</i>
<i>his strongly worded letter.</i>

368
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,048
Well, if it isn't
"Sincerely Yours."

369
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:29,890
<i>And so Gob was detained against</i>
<i>the window of the trailer...</i>

370
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,864
<i>his parents were becoming intimate in.</i>

371
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh, God, Mommy! What did you do?

372
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:42,702
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, where were you?

373
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,336
I had to help out your grandfather...

374
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,348
and then I had to vow that I would
never help your grandfather again.

375
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,350
Pretty much a normal day for me.

376
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:52,386
How are you doing?

377
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,979
I'm fine, I guess. It's just...

378
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,993
You think of prison as this place full of guilty
people and it doesn't bother you that much.

379
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,996
But if Pop-Pop could be there,
then anybody could be there.

380
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:06,090
And I don't wanna go to prison, Dad.
I don't think I could take it.

381
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,101
I know I act tough, but l...

382
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:09,864
Is this what you're worried about?

383
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,574
'Cause I got news...

384
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,906
he's, uh... he's guilty.

385
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:18,206
He is?

386
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:19,780
Oh, yeah.

387
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,908
Incredibly guilty.

388
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:32,023
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

389
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,857
<i>Tobias talks Lindsay</i>
<i>into another session.</i>

390
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:37,625
I've decided that...

391
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:41,533
I want to become an actor too.

392
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,497
<i>And George Sr. makes good...</i>

393
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,736
<i>on his promise to come clean</i>
<i>on the international accounts.</i>

394
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:54,145
There's a good chance that l...
that I may...

395
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:56,376
have committed some,
um...

396
00:20:56,485 --> 00:21:01,047
light...
treason.

<i>arrived home to find the rental car...</i>

<i>his sister, Lindsay,</i>
<i>had promised to return.</i>

3
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:15,470
<i>Lindsay, you have to cut back on everything.</i>
<i>I'm even selling the corporatejet.</i>

4
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:18,275
Great. So now we don't have
a car <i>or</i> a jet?

5
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,111
Why don't we just take an ad out
in <i>I'm Poor</i> magazine?

6
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:24,153
I'm trying to get development started.
All right?

7
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:27,121
- I've got six bulldozers
waiting to get underway.
- Bulldozing?

8
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:31,217
- What about the trees?
- We're just gonna cover them up with blankets.

9
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:34,525
- I'm ripping them out.
- Anything for a buck, right?

10
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,963
You are so materialistic.

11
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:40,730
- Don't suddenly turn this
into one of your causes.
- It's not sudden, Michael.

12
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:44,568
I've always been deeply passionate about
nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest?

13
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:46,471
I'll never forget your wedding.

14
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,567
I care deeply for nature.

15
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:52,580
- You're wearing ostrich skin boots.
- I don't care about ostriches.

16
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:54,775
You're looking at
a desperate man, Michael.

17
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:57,513
- Do you need money?
- What I need is freedom.

18
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,990
Marta is being
interviewed today on TV...

19
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:05,528
about her show,
<i>El Amor Prohibido.</i>

20
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,530
It's bad enough that I gotta go to
the awards show tomorrow night.

21
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:11,795
Today I gotta stand next to her
like I'm Rita Wilson.

22

<i>[Narrator] Gob's girlfriend Marta</i>
<i>had been nominated for a daytime Desi...</i>

<i>the award given for excellence</i>
<i>in Spanish daytime television.</i>

24
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,809
You found a woman
who believes in you.

25
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:24,676
You should make a commitment to her,
'cause life is short.

26
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,181
I would give anything
to be able to have that again.

27
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:30,151
You know? A family?
Nothing else matters.

28

- <i>[Lucille] Michael!</i>
- That's Mom. Hide.

29

[Whispering]
You brought up money earlier.

30
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,355
I actually would like
to borrow some.

31

- No.
- <i>[Lucille] Michael?</i>

32

- He's in here, Mom!
- Come on.

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,631
No way. That's mine.
Give it to me!

34
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,998
- Gob, wait! I need those tickets!
- [Sighs]

35
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:50,004
He promised me tickets
to his girlfriend's awards show.

36

You're going to that thing?

37
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:54,106
Well, my dear friend
Lucille Austero...

38
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,474
is part owner
of a television station...

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,981
and I want to show up
and hold my head high.

40
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,018
I may not have her money anymore,
but at least I have a live husband.

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,020
Ah, she's lucky to have you
as a friend.

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,819
- Buster.
- <i>Hey, brother.</i>

43
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,826
Uh, Mom said you could
tie this for me.

44
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:16,194
Make it long so Buster
doesn't seem so... round.

45
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,199
- Come here, pal.
- Thank you.

46

- Do you guys got a big date?
- Well, we're not dating. [Chuckles]

Nonetheless...
Come here...

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,940
shouldn't Buster
be spending his evenings...

49
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:29,034
with women that aren't so much...
his mother?

50
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:32,342
He's a beautiful boy.
They don't appreciate him.

51
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:35,680
It's his glasses.
They make him look like a lizard.

52
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:40,020
- Plus, he's self-conscious.
- Gee, I wonder why.

53
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:42,387
When's the last time
<i>you</i> went on a date?

54
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:46,895
I just haven't met anybody
who's not self-absorbed and impossible
to have a conversation with.

55
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:49,397
If that's a veiled criticism
about me...

56
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,059
I won't hear it
and I won't respond to it.

57
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:54,136
Hmm.
Maybe I'm wrong.

Well, we sold the jet, and they didn't
want this. What am I gonna do?

63
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,082
Besides, Lindsay, it's not

<i>Well, then, it's all yours.</i>

<i>We go to Trisha Thoon for more.</i>

An activist known as Johnny Bark
has taken residence in this beloved tree...

72

low-quality mini-mansions...

for you to neuter thousands of animals.

83

You can make dogs and cats a complete

<i>And</i> we will have enough money...

85

for me to replace the stair car
with a normal car.

86

I just told him that

but family is forever.

91

I, too, have an announcement to make.

92
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:36,270
To prove that no prison can hold me...

93
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,899
I will incarcerate myself in the penitentiary
that holds my own father...

94
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,910
only to escape 24 hours later.

95

You're going <i>into</i> prison? I thought
there was something wrong with Dad.

99
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:58,823
What? No, Dad's fine. Just saw him in there
throwing the ball around with a couple guys.

100
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,795
Which, of course,
he never did with me.

- How did you get them to agree to this?
- Oh, the warden's a fan.

- Well, any press is good press, huh?
- <i>[Gob Chuckling]</i>

Right.

Of course, that is gonna conflict
with my going to the Desis with Marta.

Well, life's a compromise.

Gob has been

- You're in the hospital.

Oh, Miss Austero.
Wh-What are you doing here?

342
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,852
- A touch of the dizzies.
- Oh. Oh.

343
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:17,085
So, listen, Buster, have you given
any, uh, thought to my offer?

344
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:19,422
[Stammers]
I'm sorry. What?

345
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,259
Well, my phone
hasn't made a peep.

346
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,969
Ha... Has your hair...

Miss Austero?

348
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,437
- It's Lucille.
- Right. Right.

349
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:36,443
That's my mom's name.

350

Yes!

Uh, you know, there isn't
a hospital bar, Mother.

357

Well, this is why

You were right, Michael.
Life <i>is</i> too short.

Mine almost ended today.

361
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,414
So I think I'm gonna
work things out with Marta.

362
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:22,422
- You are, huh?
- Yeah.

363

Boy, that's, uh...

364

that's great.

00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,831
- Hmm. You know what's funny?
- Mmm.

366
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:37,838
I was gonna walk out of that prison
last night and break up with her.

367
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,000
Good thing you didn't
bring the stairs, huh?

368
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,841
Mmm. Very funny. Yeah.
It's hysterical.

369
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,608
I'm lucky.

370
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:52,849
- Can I come in now?
- Yeah, sure. He's fine.

That's the stupid thing that I believe.

374
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,893
You two keep talking out there,
I'm gonna start getting jealous.

I was really worried about you.

You've got nothing to worry about.

378
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,911
We're gonna be together

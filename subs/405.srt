2
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:12,117
MAN (over radio):
Keep your eyes open.

3
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,580
All right, guys, what do we got?

4
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:17,914
It's quiet out there.

5
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:19,458
(over radio):
Stand by.

6
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:20,667
(indistinct radio transmission)

7
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,545
Yeah, we, uh,
we better be ready.

8
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:25,004
Yeah, I'm a man.

9
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:27,299
Don't make it look like makeup.

10
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:30,099
- (vehicle approaching)
- Car.

11
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:31,726
Car.

12
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:34,312
Is that guy one of ours?

13
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:37,148
Look at the license plate.

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,026
Looks like we got ourselves
an anus tart.

15
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,780
NARRATOR: Tobias Funke
was on his way to reconnect

16
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,699
with a daughter
he'd lost touch with.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,700
Hey, there.

18
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,326
It's Big Daddy.

19
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:51,454
I thought I'd try to call you
before I surprised you.

20
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,749
Things are...
really looking up, and...

21
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,667
(phone beeps)

22
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:57,168
Hello? Oh, damn it.

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,253
What Sudden Valley does
to these cell phones.

24
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:00,380
Oops.

25
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,215
Unbeknownst to Tobias, however,

26
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:05,009
the Sudden Valley home
he was on his way to visit...

27
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,927
Anus tart is turning
on Tracey Lane.

28
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,389
...had been rented out
to a television crew.

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,473
He's creeping up George Michael.

30
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:11,891
All right, guys, let's entrap

31
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:13,309
a local predator.

32
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:14,728
Come on. Lowlife.

33
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,813
We got to put
this piece of (bleep)...

34
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:18,255
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

35
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:19,607
Who, what, where, when,
why and how.

36
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,276
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

37
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:25,946
MAN (over radio): Anus tart is
approaching the portico.

38
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:28,742
NARRATOR: Yes, Tobias was
finally about to get

39
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:31,745
a starring role
on a hit TV show.

40
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:35,122
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

41
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:37,124
BEARD: And now the story
of the awful people

42
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,544
who are about to lose
everything, and the one newsman

43
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:42,088
who had no choice but to
entrap them all together.

44
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:46,092
It's John Beard's To Entrap
a Local Predator, "Supercreeps."

45
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,177
NARRATOR:
Now the story of a family

46
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:51,431
whose future
was abruptly cancelled,

47
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:53,391
and the one son-in-law
who had no choice

48
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,934
but to keep himself together.

49
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:01,315
It's Tobias's
Arrested Development.

50
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:09,407
Five years before Tobias was to
appear on John Beard's TV show,

51
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,743
his acting career
was as washed up...

52
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,745
- None taken.
- ...as his family...

53
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:15,455
You are soaked to the bone.

54
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,957
...and those men he was
touching for some reason.

55
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:19,834
And his wife challenged him

56
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:22,420
to reexamine the other parts
of his life as well.

57
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:24,130
There's nothing
keeping us together.

58
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,091
It's time to give up our dreams
if they're not working.

59
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,885
You know, your acting career,

60
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:31,512
this marriage
that everyone thinks is a sham

61
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:32,639
because you're gay.

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,307
I-I'm sorry.

63
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:37,518
Everyone thinks I'm gay?

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,940
Well, I mean, it's kind of
a running joke in the family.

65
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,776
I mean, y-you know that, right?

66
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,069
'Cause of the misleading way
you talk sometimes.

67
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:50,364
Oh, you're saying the way I talk
makes me sound gay?

68
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:51,658
(chuckles)
When in the last year

69
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,243
have I said anything
remotely mis...

70
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,995
♪ It's just a fallacy! ♪

71
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:59,874
...leading? Is this because
I want to be an actor,

72
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,584
and all the leading men
in Hollywood are gay?

73
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:03,419
I don't think
that all the leading men

74
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,504
in Hollywood are gay.

75
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,046
- Oh, honey.
- (sighs)

76
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,758
Look, we're chasing things
that aren't real.

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,511
Maybe we need to go out there
and find out

78
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,095
what we're meant to do.

79
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:16,599
His wife was giving him
the cold shoulder.

80
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,225
And after kissing it good-bye,

81
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:22,146
he sat with her family,
feeling lost...

82
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:25,023
Well, you look like I feel.

83
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,943
...and very misunderstood.

84
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:28,361
Gay?

85
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,446
No, I...

86
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:31,865
No.

87
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:34,492
Tobias knew
it was time to find out

88
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,734
what he was truly meant to do.

89
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,829
So when he came across a book

90
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,080
the universe
had placed in his path,

91
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:41,415
he was open to its inspiration.

92
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,543
Oh, they're still reading,
but...

93
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,795
well, I guess I can
leave them some love.

94
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,839
So he just took
"eat" and "pray."

95
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,425
"Eat" was easy,

96
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,804
although it provided
no cosmic answers for him.

97
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:58,016
But it was the part about India
that really got to him.

98
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,518
And so, like the heroine
of Eat, Pray,

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,436
- Tobias decided
- Wait a minute.

100
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:05,565
to get as far away
from his wife as possible.

101
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:12,196
And so Tobias found himself
booking passage to India.

102
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,991
And soon, he discovered
his wife was also

103
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,951
preparing to go somewhere...

104
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,912
- I think you have my suitcase.
- ...far away.

105
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,914
(sighs)
I'm so sorry, Tobias.

106
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:22,248
Look, I've already packed.

107
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,249
Can I just use this one?

108
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,084
Oh, what the heck.

109
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,379
I guess having matching luggage
isn't so romantic anymore.

110
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,048
And these romantic gestures are

111
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,717
possibly why people think
I'm a homosexual.

112
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,512
Well, it's time to correct
old misconceptions.

113
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:38,932
And that is why
I'm making a new start.

114
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:41,350
Oh, a new start.

115
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:43,895
Filled with compassion and love.

116
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,271
I like that.

117
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:46,689
Well, I've already got
the license plate,

118
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:47,815
so go cry in your pie!

119
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:50,026
And so Tobias, hoping to

120
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:54,154
"straighten out" his image,
set out on a new start,

121
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:57,491
beginning with a trip
to the airport in an outfit

122
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,786
he pretty much put together
himself.

123
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:01,495
Well, I guess this is why

124
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:02,956
you never see them
driving convertibles.

125
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:04,457
I'll have to check on that one.

126
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:06,542
But it certainly
wasn't embraced...

127
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,919
Stay in your lane, anus tart!

128
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,295
(bleep) anus tart!

129
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:10,713
...by the local
Indian community.

130
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,131
You have the true sense
of the oneness of all.

131
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:14,759
And his quest
hit a bump early on,

132
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:18,012
as he struggled to learn
the customs and gestures of

133
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,014
- the culture he hoped to adopt.
- Oh, goddamn it!

134
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:23,101
Am I the only one
who still dresses to fly?

135
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:25,352
Well, there we go.

136
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,729
India clean.

137
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,147
(chuckles)

138
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:29,774
Now, how did I...

139
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:31,067
No. No.

140
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,402
Unfortunately,
recreating the look

141
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,237
- of the traditional Indian garb
- Are you finished? Oh.

142
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,906
turned out to be more
difficult...

143
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:38,828
I look like one of those
hot guys from Spartacus.

144
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:42,036
...without the aid of Pradeep,
the helpful Indian salesman...

145
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,246
I feel like there was
less up top.

146
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:47,207
...at Bed, Bath & Beyond, who
helped him learn how to tie it.

147
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:48,709
Ah, got it, okay.

148
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,128
(choking)

149
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:53,589
Yes, I actually
like this better.

150
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:55,091
- (knocking)
- Yes?

151
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,886
Canadian?

152
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,554
No, I'm American.

153
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:02,682
Oh, yeah. I'm Canadian.

154
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:04,058
Oh. Sorry.

155
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,977
But because it was
a long flight,

156
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,688
he figured he'd wait a beat
on finding his true calling

157
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:10,648
and watch something to
take his mind off Lindsay...

158
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,067
How could they not have
Failure to Launch?

159
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,193
...who he knew was far away
at the time.

160
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:16,696
(groans)
Goddamn it.

161
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:19,365
And after taking

162
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,950
the wrong bag at the airport...

163
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:22,576
WOMAN (over P.A.): Do not leave
any goats unattended.

164
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,997
All unattended goats
will be confiscated.

165
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,374
...Tobias finally arrived...

166
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:31,002
And so Tobias Funke
embarked on a--

167
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:34,714
Oh, dear, Lord, it's... hot!

168
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:37,633
...in India, yes, where he was
very uncomfortable.

169
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,927
Not only because
the wind whipped up

170
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,138
his queen-sized
fitted mini-sarong,

171
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,974
but because he looked
the wrong direction

172
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:46,216
when stepping into the street.

173
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:47,434
(tires screeching)

174
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,520
And so Tobias experienced India

175
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,522
from the inside
of a hospital room,

176
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:53,024
where the staff
was being trained...

177
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,984
This man here broke his skull
in two places.

178
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:57,277
...by the same doctor
he'd had in America.

179
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,446
Once outside the airport
and once in the elevator

180
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:02,240
when his sheet got caught and
he was pulled off his gurney.

181
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:03,409
Literally.

182
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,730
- (laughter)
- Two places indeed.

183
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,328
This is very funny.

184
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,122
It's like that new show
we just caught, Laugh-In.

185
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:09,456
My name is...

186
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,084
Oh!

187
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,420
Now I've broken my skull
in a third place!

188
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:17,090
On this elephant guy statue!

189
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,800
Tobias had wanted the universe
to provide him a sign.

190
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,552
You should be a comedy actor.

191
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:23,721
And finally it had.

192
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,765
This is the sign I've been...
(groans)

193
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:27,975
Looking for.

194
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,894
And after two more weeks
in the hospital,

195
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,105
it was time
for his flight home.

196
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,023
And that's when he got
another sign.

197
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,983
(cell phone ringing)

198
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,569
A call from Lindsay.

199
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,362
Although he wouldn't be able
to reach the phone for hours...

200
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:42,073
I'm ready to make this work.

201
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:44,408
...due to his already
weakened spine.

202
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,743
(bell chimes)

203
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,622
NARRATOR:
Tobias and Lindsay

204
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,498
shared the news
of their new start

205
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,917
at a family gathering.

206
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,585
I got the part.

207
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,796
You know, it's funny,
for I, too, find that

208
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,214
I am on a journey.

209
00:07:58,256 --> 00:07:59,548
Although, as we discovered

210
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,467
when our MasterCard bill
came back,

211
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,052
it was the same one she took.

212
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,887
But mine has confirmed
that I should

213
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,306
redouble my efforts to achieve

214
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:11,269
the unachievable dream
of being an actor.

215
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,105
A journey
that has left me eager

216
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:17,775
to connect with my true love.

217
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,027
Particularly if she finds her...

218
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,780
way clear to covering
a 2, 000-rupee

219
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:25,950
City of Hopelessness
hospital debt.

220
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:28,119
The trick is going to be
getting anyone to believe

221
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,411
that her husband
is straight enough

222
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,330
to have a true love
that's a woman.

223
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,082
What are you implying?

224
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:35,126
Oh, I don't think there was
any implying going on at all.

225
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,335
Didn't hear any implying.

226
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:37,544
I wasn't implying.

227
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:38,921
I'm sorry, Mother.

228
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,506
It's just, I've got
a bit of a stick

229
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,008
up my "bunghole"
about what I've now found

230
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,467
is a running joke about me.

231
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,303
But let's be honest.

232
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:48,931
For 2, 000 rupees, we'd both
go down on Matthew McConaughey.

233
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,808
(chuckles):
Yes, Michael?

234
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,852
At the time of this
family meeting,

235
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,061
2, 000 rupees was $36.

236
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,022
I wouldn't.

237
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,107
GEORGE SR.:
Of course you wouldn't, Michael.

238
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,109
You never accept help
from anyone.

239
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,402
And hoping to do things
differently this time,

240
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:05,281
Lindsay immediately started
spending money she didn't have.

241
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:06,907
JAMES:
Are you ready to make a move?

242
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:11,537
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

243
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,039
Oh, good heavens.

244
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,041
While Tobias pursued

245
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:17,043
the life of
a professional actor.

246
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,086
Listen, I'm an actor,
you're an agent.

247
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:20,213
You do the math.

248
00:09:20,254 --> 00:09:21,714
I want you to represent me.

249
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:23,924
In other words,
you do the math--

250
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,343
the money, the negotiating.

251
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:27,427
You know I'm not
that kind of agent, right?

252
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,055
I'm a real estate agent.

253
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,807
I'm a predator; I sell
giant houses to very poor people

254
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,559
who can't afford them
with predatory loans.

255
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,519
No, see, that's the money stuff
I don't understand.

256
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,437
All you need to do
is tell people

257
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,523
what a terrific actor I am,
'cause I can't do it believably.

258
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:40,900
What do you say?

259
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:42,651
Sounds like it shouldn't be
too much work.

260
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:43,819
(laughs):
Huzzah!

261
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,071
Okay, here's the number

262
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,114
of my current agent
Mike Matthews.

263
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:50,201
He's at Allstate. Fire him.

264
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:54,205
Tobias started seeing positive
career signs everywhere...

265
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:55,622
...decorating my quarters.

266
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:59,085
...he chose to put them.

267
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:00,920
And at his new agent's
suggestion...

268
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,838
Hi. I'm after pending.

269
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,465
...he even snuck on to a studio
lot to hand out head shots

270
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:08,719
to extras and other
show business insiders.

271
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:10,388
Taft-Hartley pending.

272
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:12,139
Things were
looking up for the Funkes.

273
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,516
They even celebrated
their first

274
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:16,769
- home-cooked Thanksgiving.
- Including duck l'orange.

275
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,062
- (duck quacking)
- Oh!

276
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:19,980
- Oh, no!
- (Lindsay screams)

277
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:22,316
Lindsay!
Lindsay, get the scooper!

278
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,692
Throw oranges at it.

279
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,652
- Hot orange! Hot orange.
- (duck quacking)

280
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:26,946
All right...

281
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:28,572
It's throwing its voice!

282
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,157
- MAEBY: Oh!
- TOBIAS: Lindsay!

283
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,411
And so they went

284
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:36,163
to the Fountain Valley
China Garden instead.

285
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,375
And if the collapse
of the housing market,

286
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,835
- his lack of auditions...
- Tobias Funke.

287
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:43,796
or even the writers' strike

288
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,881
couldn't deter Tobias
from his dream,

289
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:47,841
the suicide of his ruined

290
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:49,843
and despondent agent
certainly could.

291
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:54,140
I believe he died as a warning,
in a way, his message perhaps

292
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:56,183
to live within our means

293
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:59,019
and be realistic
about our lives.

294
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,604
And yet it didn't.

295
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:03,065
Well, then I shall
redouble my efforts

296
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:05,943
- so that he died in vain.
- (others gasp)

297
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:08,279
(stammers)

298
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,030
Meaning he will have led
a pointless life,

299
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,157
is what I mean.

300
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,450
Yes, carry on. Thank you.

301
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,867
And he soon found himself

302
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:17,288
bringing his wife
to an acting class

303
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,915
in an effort to jump-start
his career and marriage.

304
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:21,792
If everyone's good,
you'll get your juice.

305
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,337
What did you say the name
of this acting class was again?

306
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:25,838
Method One Clinic.

307
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,399
LINDSAY:
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

308
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:30,550
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

309
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:32,428
And Tobias found himself
captivated

310
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,096
by one of the monologues.

311
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:36,807
And I made it in that movie,
the Fantastic Four,

312
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,685
uh, but it wasn't fantastic
for me.

313
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:41,645
Uh, I got carried away.

314
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:44,231
And I'm like,
"This (bleep) is (bleep) up,

315
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,692
"and I've got to get
my (bleep) together

316
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,819
or I'm gonna be (bleep), too."

317
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:51,322
Anyways, now I'm sober,
and I'm trying.

318
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:53,199
It's... super hard.

319
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,700
- (groans)
- (applause)

320
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,243
Thank you. Thank you.

321
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:58,536
It was a devastating
and personal story.

322
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:00,247
Okay, notes:

323
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,416
um, first of all, it seemed
you were slurring a bit there,

324
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,918
and I just think
you'd have so much more fun

325
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,420
punching those... those words.

326
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:07,838
Get it out there.

327
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,548
"This (bleep)
is (bleep) up, sir."

328
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,550
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm not familiar
with the piece, so...

329
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:14,470
No, no, that's it.

330
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:18,224
But I am familiar with your work
in the Fantastic Four, however.

331
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:20,142
- You've seen that?
- Of course I have.

332
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:22,269
20 years earlier,
DeBrie Bardeaux

333
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:24,480
had played Sue Storm
in the low-budget version

334
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:27,525
of the Fantastic Four, produced
by Imagine Entertainment,

335
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,527
when, during Imagine's
Christmas party,

336
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,488
a drunk lawyer reminded them
they'd lose the rights

337
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,741
if they didn't make the film
in the next six days.

338
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:40,413
After a two-hour search,
they found their entire cast.

339
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:43,541
They also proved useful six
days later at the wrap party.

340
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,584
I almost never get recognized
as the Invisible Girl.

341
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,254
I can't believe you saw me.

342
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:51,048
Well, I-I thought it was
"fantastic."

343
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,133
Actually, most
of the performance

344
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:54,718
that had so captivated
Tobias...

345
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,512
Hey, maybe she came into
this Light Bulbs Unlimited.

346
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,180
She was here a minute ago.

347
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,266
...was performed
by a fishing line.

348
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,518
This is the gayest
Starbucks ever!

349
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,562
Did his fishing line break, too?

350
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:07,022
DeBRIE:
Well, my acting career is over.

351
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:10,317
Oh, don't say that. You've got
to say, "Keep the dream alive."

352
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,735
That's what helps me.

353
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,611
Well, this is what's helping me.

354
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:15,739
- Oh.
- It's really good.

355
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,783
Carl Weathers used to give us
grape juice.

356
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,244
But then he'd add five dollars
to our credit card.

357
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:22,620
Well, here is to
our acting addiction.

358
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:23,621
Yep.

359
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,665
May we never be cured.

360
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,960
Are you crying? Oh, I'm crying.

361
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,670
Oh, it's a nosebleed.

362
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,214
(DeBrie gasping)

363
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:34,467
Oh, thank you so much.

364
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:36,594
Tobias had found a friend.

365
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,137
- You're neat!
- You're neat.

366
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,555
(laughing):
You're neat.

367
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:41,056
You're neat.

368
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,727
NARRATOR: And after a
not-very-cute meet-cute,

369
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,272
Tobias continued to find
DeBrie's behavior delightful,

370
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:50,274
even when the methadone
made her think

371
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:53,277
she was a piece of toast.

372
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,279
There, now I can see

373
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:58,240
a pretty face under all that
butter substitute.

374
00:13:58,282 --> 00:14:00,326
And I recognize you
from somewhere,

375
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:04,037
but it's not the Fantastic Four;
it's from somewhere else.

376
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,499
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

377
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,083
Episodics? Been there.

378
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,044
It wasn't episodic.

379
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,588
She had been in a series

380
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,047
of soft-core porn movies
about women

381
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,882
leading straight men
into gay sex,

382
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,135
- called Straight Bait.
- This is my brother. He's gay.

383
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:19,719
If you want to have sex with me,

384
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,763
then you've got to have sex
with him first.

385
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:25,142
And if you don't want to have
sex with her, you must be gay.

386
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,353
I'll show you how not gay I am.

387
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:32,316
She did six of these movies,

388
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:35,277
and after lunch,
did three more.

389
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,029
It's nice to be
recognized though.

390
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,822
Marky Bark--
sometimes he doesn't know

391
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,907
when I'm in the same room.

392
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:42,284
And sometimes it feels like

393
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:43,846
it's not the face blindness,
you know?

394
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:45,829
It's the same
with me and Lindsay.

395
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,207
I know she's trying,
but she doesn't believe

396
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:50,209
in my acting career.

397
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,961
Maybe she's right. I've yet
to make more money as an actor

398
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:55,005
than I ever did as a doctor.

399
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,840
And that's with
Country-Wide behind me.

400
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:59,051
You're... wait, you're a doctor?
You can write scripts?

401
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,011
Well, I like to think so.

402
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:04,390
You should never give up a dream
if you can write scripts.

403
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,393
You seem like you'd be
a good doctor/actor.

404
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,728
It was the first
positive reinforcement

405
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,855
Tobias had had since India.

406
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:15,484
You remind me of
Billy Crystal... Mmm, mmm!

407
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:18,195
It would have broken
Tobias's heart if he knew

408
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:20,364
she was about to say
"Billy Crystal Meth,"

409
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:21,823
a funny drug dealer.

410
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:25,369
Uh, I... got a bit carried away

411
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:27,663
when you compared me
to Billy Crystal.

412
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:30,207
You remind me
of Billy Crystal...

413
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:33,793
Once again, she was going
to say "Billy Crystal Meth."

414
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:36,547
I'm sorry, but, DeBrie,
I-I've never met anyone

415
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,424
who understands me like you do.

416
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,634
- Or at all.
- Maybe, with someone like you,

417
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,302
I could have a new start.

418
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:45,764
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

419
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:49,476
Did you see my license plate--
"A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T"?

420
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:52,062
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

421
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:55,815
Did you see my Straight Bait
movie of the same name?

422
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:58,193
(singsong):
Coincidence.

423
00:15:58,235 --> 00:15:59,737
We should be together.

424
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:01,154
We should run away.

425
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:02,573
(stammering)

426
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:03,865
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:05,534
Well, this is happening so fast.

428
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,119
Well, what do I do
about Lindsay?

429
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,913
I mean, can I just improv my way
out of a marriage?

430
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:14,501
Yes, and... let's do this.

431
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:15,586
Blackout.

432
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:17,254
Unaware that a similar

433
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:19,798
off-menu swap had just occurred
at Swappigans,

434
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,383
Tobias broke the news

435
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,761
that he was leaving Lindsay
in a phone call.

436
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,262
...for I have met someone.

437
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:26,888
It's not important who it is.

438
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,474
(laughs):
It's Sue Storm.

439
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,643
I'm so sorry,
but DeBrie believes in me,

440
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,603
and she stopped my heart, too.

441
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:35,689
If you're wondering what "too"
referred to, it was this:

442
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:37,023
Let's do this.

443
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,525
Blackout.

444
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,736
And scene, as they say.

445
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:42,139
Her heart stopped!
She-She's dying!

446
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:44,615
Please, someone!
She had too much butter!

447
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,116
- She's a very famous actress!
- Someone say "butter" out here?

448
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,867
Oh, my God,
that's a butter face.

449
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:50,162
- How much butter did the patient have?
- I don't know.

450
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:51,997
- A Star Trek chess set's worth.
- Damn it, that Swappigans

451
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,458
puts more people in
this hospital. Make way, people!

452
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,709
We got a 61-year-old male

453
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,169
in full cardiac arrest
coming through.

454
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,420
You have to wait outside, sir.

455
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,713
Be careful of her face!

456
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,507
She's an actress!

457
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,258
(loud sobbing)

458
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,843
It's worth noting that Tobias

459
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,179
had heard this hospital
in Orange County

460
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,765
was a favorite
of show business big shots

461
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,266
seeking plastic surgery.

462
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:13,393
We're both actors!

463
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,479
(loud, exaggerated sobbing)

464
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:20,526
NARRATOR:
On the day of Lucille's trial,

465
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,820
Tobias was in a hospital
with a woman

466
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:25,531
he'd both fallen for
and had rushed into an ICU.

467
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,283
See? Makeup makes everyone
feel a little better.

468
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:29,785
You didn't leave me.

469
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,704
Everybody leaves me.

470
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:35,499
I've been left in Dumpsters
and on a curb and...

471
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,042
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

472
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,461
Excuse me. Could you, uh,
leave us alone for...

473
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,213
- Yeah, absolutely, yes.
- Thank you.

474
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:43,507
Oh, no, I-I'd like him
to-to stay.

475
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:44,591
- Really?
- Yeah.

476
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:45,592
Okay.

477
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:46,885
I'm afraid that you have

478
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,804
tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

479
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,263
gonorrhea, hepatitis,
pancreatitis,

480
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:53,600
trichomonitis,
nongonococcal urethritis.

481
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:56,562
All the itises, really,
and there's also

482
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,813
a host of osises.

483
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,565
Now, what this means
in nonmedical terms

484
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:02,526
is that you have landed, uh,
a real party girl.

485
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,444
TOBIAS:
Well, will she be okay?

486
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,154
Well, we can treat
all of these things,

487
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,823
but if she's really
gonna be okay,

488
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:09,825
uh, she's gonna have to tackle
this drug problem.

489
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:12,077
You didn't tell me
you had a drug problem.

490
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:14,287
We met at a methadone clinic.

491
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,288
Are you high?

492
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,749
We met at an acting class.

493
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,500
The Method One...

494
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:21,211
There it is. I'm gonna let
you guys, uh, hash this out.

495
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,296
I guess I shouldn't have
lied about being clean

496
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,550
when I took that methadone,
but I'll do better this time.

497
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:27,885
Or are you gonna leave me

498
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:30,095
now that you know
that I'm a druggie?

499
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:33,432
DeBrie, look, some people
struggle with addiction,

500
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:36,059
other people are incapable
of ever being nude.

501
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:37,603
Everybody has something.

502
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:40,647
And it's my professional opinion
that your drug use

503
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,610
is a direct result of your
abandoning your dream of acting.

504
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,403
You are a gifted actress.

505
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,405
When I first saw Straight Bait,

506
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,740
there were two men making love,

507
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:51,784
but I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

508
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,535
You watched Straight Bait?

509
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,078
Oh, just2, 4and9.

510
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,497
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you.

511
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,751
But stick with me,
and I'll make you famous.

512
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:04,504
By cashing in
on your most celebrated role.

513
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:05,672
Come one, come all!

514
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,133
Get your photo taken
with Sue Storm

515
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:09,635
from the Fantastic Four!

516
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,261
Hey, is that Jessica Alba?

517
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:14,180
No, this is the original
Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux!

518
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,099
- Who?
- The original Sue Storm,

519
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:17,726
DeBrie Bardeaux. She--
No, no!

520
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:18,727
No free pictures, kids!

521
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:19,728
No, no, scram!

522
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,771
Get out of here! Go!

523
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:22,105
Go, get out of here.

524
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:23,649
I don't think this is working.

525
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,025
Maybe I need to get
a regular job.

526
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,194
I do have a law degree.

527
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,071
I know, I know,
and I'm a doctor.

528
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:32,031
But no, let's not settle.

529
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,033
Look, it's the Fantastic Four.

530
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,578
No one recognizes one alone.

531
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,955
I've got an idea.

532
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,081
Ten dollars gets you
a picture with

533
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,333
real Hollywood characters!

534
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:42,542
What do you say? Ten dollars.

535
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:43,543
That's certainly cheap.

536
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,796
Oh! Hello, young man,

537
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:48,089
and his... uncle? Neighbor?

538
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:49,382
Father.

539
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:50,676
Oh! That's terrific.

540
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:52,093
(laughs)
Well, how would you like

541
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:53,470
to have your picture taken

542
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:56,348
with real Hollywood
movie land characters?

543
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:57,766
Are you the Smurfs?

544
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,351
No, no, no.

545
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:00,936
They're the Ambiguously Gay Duo.

546
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:02,270
Oh, I assure you,

547
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:04,105
there's nothing ambiguous
about me.

548
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:06,399
I'm Johnny Storm,
the human flamer.

549
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:10,236
And this is Sue Storm, my sister
and fellow fighter-in-law.

550
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:12,405
Now watch as I get--
no, I have special effects!

551
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,282
Look, children love fire.

552
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,325
Oh.

553
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,326
This isn't working either.

554
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:17,995
(sighs)
You're right.

555
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:20,455
Two people in blue
doesn't say Fantastic Four.

556
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:22,165
You know what though?

557
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,250
I think I may have
just the thing.

558
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,460
Oh?

559
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:27,546
Just "the thing."

560
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:29,006
Cut to...

561
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,591
Now that I'm the iconic
rock man The Thing,

562
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,218
no one will misunderstand.

563
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,971
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

564
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,848
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm
and The Thing?

565
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,683
Oh, who's smart now?

566
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,393
Indeed we are.

567
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,520
In fact, they were orthodox
members of the law firm

568
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:46,231
Feinberg, Feinberg, Feinberg
& Feinberg.

569
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,984
We represent Stan Lee
and Marvel Enterprises.

570
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:50,652
This is a cease and desist

571
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:52,445
ordering you
to stop impersonating

572
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,113
any of our trademark characters.

573
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:55,615
Oh, let me take a look at that.

574
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:56,700
I have a law degree.

575
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:57,910
No, DeBrie, I've got this.

576
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:00,119
Mr. Feinberg?

577
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,788
Uh, would it change your mind

578
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,876
if I offered you
a free Sue Storm armband?

579
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:07,794
It did not change his mind.

580
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:10,547
And although the hate crime
charges were dismissed,

581
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,298
they were told
they could not continue

582
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,800
to pose as the Fantastic Four.

583
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:16,553
Can they really make us leave
Hollywood Boulevard?

584
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:19,681
Well, apparently in
this instance, paper beats rock.

585
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:20,682
You have a rock?

586
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,018
No, I am your rock now.

587
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,061
Oh.

588
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,228
So what are we gonna do

589
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,939
now that we don't
have the rights?

590
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,732
Well, we just go off-brand.

591
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:32,318
Uh, we'll just change the names
and do a cheap generic knockoff.

592
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,112
Kids don't care.

593
00:21:34,153 --> 00:21:35,864
Tobias took them down
to a street

594
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:38,575
near Harbor Boulevard,
where his friend Gary Goose

595
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:40,159
told him
they didn't police very much.

596
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,081
Rock Monster and Ability
to Be Invisible Person.

597
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,705
Hello, young man.
What brings you

598
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:46,666
to at least 500 feet
past the entrance of Disneyland?

599
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,834
Dad, can I get my picture taken

600
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,002
with The Thing
and Invisible Girl?

601
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:50,545
They're the Fantastic Four.

602
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:52,547
Well, actually, technically,
I'm Rock Monster,

603
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,883
and this is
Ability to Be Invisible Person.

604
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:56,802
- Hey, you guys want the ten dollars or not?
- Yeah.

605
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:58,344
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah.

606
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,055
Yes. Okay.

607
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:02,641
We're The Thing
and the Invisible Girl.

608
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:03,767
- You're under arrest.
- What?

609
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,310
Boom. Turn around.

610
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,686
- Let's go.
- I didn't...

611
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,105
- Let's go. Get up there.
- Oh! Oh!

612
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:09,898
Come on.

613
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,900
- Oh, come on, now.
- (chuckles): No, no, no.

614
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:14,319
We're not gonna kill him,
we're just gonna handcuff him.

615
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,946
You can't shoot us
'cause it's not a felony.

616
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:18,073
Keep your eyes on her.
I'll be right back.

617
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:20,075
Okay.

618
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:23,787
DeBRIE:
If it happens again,

619
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:25,914
you know, it will be
a third strike.

620
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,624
Three-strikes law's up for
review in the appellate courts,

621
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,959
but we really
shouldn't be charging.

622
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,710
I know of a street
in Garden Grove

623
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:32,712
- where they don't police very much.
- Okay.

624
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:34,255
NARRATOR:
Things were looking down.

625
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,925
And over the following weeks,

626
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,760
their financial situation
grew dire enough

627
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:40,053
for this to happen.

628
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,972
We're broke.

629
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:43,932
But you can't sell
your Fantastic Four costume.

630
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:45,308
I mean, that would be
like a fisherman

631
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,352
selling his fishing costume.

632
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:49,604
No, I was gonna
have sex with him.

633
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,188
For money.

634
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,899
What? No. Put that back on.

635
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,901
You don't have to
degrade yourself this way.

636
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:57,070
Hey, I'm not a thing.

637
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:59,322
Hey, I am a Thing.

638
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:01,908
And so, with no other options,
Tobias returned

639
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,409
to his in-laws' penthouse,

640
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:06,371
desperate enough
to ransack the place,

641
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:09,332
when it appeared
someone had beaten him to it.

642
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:11,168
Michael.

643
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,878
No, George Michael.

644
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,796
LUCILLE 2:
Somebody, help!

645
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:16,715
And that's when he heard
what sounded like two ostriches

646
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,842
making love to a pop hit.

647
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:20,552
But was actually this.

648
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:24,097
♪ Why don't you
go away, go away ♪

649
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:25,640
♪ Get away, get away ♪

650
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,600
♪ Stay away ♪

651
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:30,187
♪ You're hopelessly
hopeless... ♪

652
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:32,605
(screams)
Good bird.

653
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,191
- (screams)
- (ostrich squawking)

654
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:35,650
Stop it, chicken!

655
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:37,861
Somebody help!

656
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:39,071
Lucille 2!

657
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,906
Help! Help!
Kevin, give me a hand!

658
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:42,448
Get Dr. Bowman or Alicia.

659
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,825
Either one.

660
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,994
This woman's been
attacked by an ostrich!

661
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:47,954
Ah, Tobias got a new girlfriend.

662
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,246
(laughs)

663
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,460
NARRATOR: Tobias had acted like
an actual superhero

664
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:55,587
- and saved Lucille 2.
- There's my hero.

665
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:57,089
You know, the doctor said

666
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,381
if that bird had gotten through

667
00:23:58,423 --> 00:24:00,341
my second layer of makeup,
it could've done

668
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:01,593
permanent damage to my skin.

669
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,344
And I want to repay you.

670
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:06,014
You're a doctor,
and you're out of work.

671
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,933
- Well...
- How would you like to come work for me,

672
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:09,392
at Austerity?

673
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:11,436
The rehab center? That's yours?

674
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,479
Well, my brother Argyle
runs it day to day.

675
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:14,689
But we are so understaffed.

676
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,191
You'd be such a gift.

677
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:19,276
It would only pay
120 grand a year to start.

678
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:21,529
Tobias, whose girlfriend
had nearly

679
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:23,949
sold her body for money
in front of him,

680
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,202
knew that everyone at some time
has to face reality.

681
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,328
(sustained groaning)

682
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:33,374
- But that this wasn't the time.
- No.

683
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,127
- You turned it down?!
- Uh-huh.

684
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:38,004
I almost (bleep) a guy
for a hamburger,

685
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:40,924
and you turned down
$120, 000 a year?

686
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:43,384
To keep our dream alive,
yes, I did.

687
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,137
I thought you'd be proud of me.

688
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,055
After all, a doctor in India

689
00:24:47,097 --> 00:24:49,641
told me that I have the gift
to make people laugh.

690
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,308
- (sobbing)
- Why are you crying?

691
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,394
(sobbing):
You're worse than Marky.

692
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:57,398
He couldn't see me,
but you can't hear me.

693
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,400
(sobbing)

694
00:24:59,442 --> 00:25:01,903
The setback sent
an emotionally fragile DeBrie

695
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:04,614
back to her old ways.

696
00:25:04,656 --> 00:25:07,200
And before long,
she was picked up by a limo

697
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:08,952
for a night of
being passed around

698
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:11,412
amongst Hollywood creeps.

699
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:15,458
For three weeks, Tobias waited,
hoping DeBrie would return.

700
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,670
Perhaps it was
the morning he awoke to find

701
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:20,255
two bums using him as a pillow

702
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:22,465
that he realized
she wasn't coming back.

703
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:24,050
Who are you supposed to be?

704
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,552
Oh, I'm The Thing
from Fantastic Four.

705
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:29,555
You've been served, (bleep).

706
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,142
Oh, (bleep) me.

707
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:33,977
Are you undercover as well?

708
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,937
I'm CIA.
Not here for you though.

709
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,315
Scoping out
Imagine Entertainment.

710
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:40,733
So, with nowhere to go...

711
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,443
Thought I'd try you again.

712
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:44,154
...and no one to help him
out of his rock suit...

713
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:46,281
Honey, you read
comic books, yes?

714
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:47,824
...he went to see
if his daughter

715
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:50,327
would give him a place to stay.

716
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,495
(indistinct radio transmission)

717
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:54,873
(singing quietly)

718
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:57,667
Now the fun begins,
right, Officer Three?

719
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,544
I'll say.

720
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:02,130
...and why and how. Who, what,
when, where, why and how.

721
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:06,301
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

722
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:08,636
And perhaps it was this
that would finally

723
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:11,223
get him to admit
that he sometimes did speak

724
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:12,932
in a misleading way.

725
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:15,768
Daddy needs to get
his rocks off.

726
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,235
BEARD: On the next
To Entrap a Local Predator...

727
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,237
(high-pitched):
I'll be down in a minute.

728
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,030
Have some lemonade.

729
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,823
TV NARRATOR: Predator gets
its first rock-solid case.

730
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:31,534
(normal voice):
Pretty good lemonade, huh?

731
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:32,827
It is.

732
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,537
Is there alcohol in here--
John Beard!

733
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:35,538
Please, have a seat.

734
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,539
Okay.

735
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:37,707
Why are you here?

736
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:39,125
I'm here to see my little girl.

737
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,378
I wanted to show her
Daddy's Thing.

738
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:42,712
What are you doing here?

739
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:45,506
I'm doing a, um,
a local interest piece.

740
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:46,507
Mm.

741
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:47,592
Okay, get in there, boys.

742
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,302
Oh, really local.

743
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:50,345
That's right, yeah.

744
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,428
Is this about my daughter?

745
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,597
Oh, so it's your daughter

746
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:54,307
- you're here to see?
- Yes.

747
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:56,433
Maeby.

748
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:58,311
If he's got a daughter,
then how old is she?

749
00:26:58,353 --> 00:26:59,436
BEARD:
Let me ask you this.

750
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:00,437
How old is she?

751
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,481
(chuckles):
Oh.

752
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,359
Why do you put me on the spot?

753
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:07,279
Um, I want to say 19?

754
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,864
But I like
to think of her as 15.

755
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:10,907
Well, you're free to go.

756
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,533
She's not here.

757
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:14,255
TV NARRATOR:
But this creep won't take "go"

758
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,703
- for an answer.
- Oh, that's all right.

759
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,289
I'll stay, I'll wait.

760
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,291
And this creep makes himself
right at home.

761
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:21,293
- Give me just a minute.
- He's not leaving.

762
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:23,253
- He's not leaving.
- He's not leaving.

763
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,171
Tell him there's a raccoon
in the backyard.

764
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:26,756
Hey, guess what.

765
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,549
There's a raccoon
out on the patio!

766
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:29,617
Bull (bleep).

767
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:30,907
Where is that little guy?

768
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:33,805
And this guy turns out to be
a real comedian.

769
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:34,635
(groans loudly)

770
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,530
I just broke my skull
in a fourth place:

771
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,134
the patio!

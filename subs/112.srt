00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,590
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786

<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:25,610
- <i>[Man Narrating] It was</i>
<i>Michael's sister's anniversary.</i>
- Hi.

6
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:28,375
<i>He'd convinced his mother</i>
<i>to throw a party for her.</i>

7
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,347
Lindsay, how's this for
an anniversary cake?

8
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:34,387
Anniversary? You asked me
to throw a Valentine's Day party.

9
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,718
- Did I?
- You tricked me.

10
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:39,987
<i>I deceived you, Mom. Tricked makes</i>
<i>it sound like we have a playful relationship.</i>

11
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:43,461
Touché. Lupe, untie the balloons!

12
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:48,593
<i>Michael, all alone</i>
<i>on Valentine's Day?</i>

13
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:50,671
How's that possible?

14
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:52,671
You seem like such a romantic to me.

15
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:56,869
<i>l- l-I can just see you showing up</i>
<i>on some lucky girl's porch...</i>

16
00:00:56,978 --> 00:01:00,072
in a tuxedo
with a bottle of champagne.

17
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,149
Yeah. Well, if I show up
with all that stuff...

18
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,410
I could probably just get away
with shorts and a T-shirt, right?

19
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:06,486
Which is good
'cause I don't even have a tuxedo.

20
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:09,522
So you're saying there's no one
you're even interested in?

21
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:11,956
<i>[Narrator] In fact,</i>
<i>Michael had become enamored of Marta...</i>

22
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:15,119
<i>when Gob was having second thoughts</i>
<i>about the relationship.</i>

23
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,289
- I've made a huge mistake.
- <i>But when Gob recommitted to her</i>...

24
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:22,028
- I've made a huge mistake.
- <i>Michael decided to do the</i>
<i>noble thing and let her go.</i>

25
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:26,539
There was somebody for a while,
but it was too much of a brother... bother.

26
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:35,973
<i>That can't feel good.</i>

27
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,449
It's fine. I'm over it.
I'm okay by myself, you know?

28
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:41,453
I really just want to focus
on my family's happiness.

29
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:44,456
That's why I threw this party.
I mean, 14 years, huh?

30
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:46,458
You've got to be doing
somethin' right.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,188
Well, if you call not filing
for divorce "something right."

32
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:51,355
- But I guess we keep it interesting.
- Where's Tobias?

33
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,899
He's on the balcony having margaritas
with Carl Weathers.

34
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,960
<i>[Narrator] Tobias had recently</i>
<i>hired actor Carl Weathers as a drama coach.</i>

35
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:00,336
Do you see me more as
the respected dramatic actor...

36
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,534
or more the beloved comic actor?

37
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:05,476
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's still plenty of meat on that bone.

38
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,776
You take this home, throw it in a pot.
Add some broth, a potato...

39
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:11,408
Baby, you got a stew goin'.

40
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,545
Yes, that's fine. But I would like to focus
on my acting, Mr. Weathers.

41
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,987
I did give you my last $1,100.

42
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:20,026
Let me tell you a little story
about acting.

43
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:23,494
I was doing this Showtime movie,
<i>Hot Ice,</i> with Anne Archer.

44
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:26,088
Never once touched my per diem.

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,692
I go to craft service, get some raw veggies,
bacon, cup of soup...

46
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:32,329
[Chuckles]
Baby, I had a stew goin'.

47
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,672
I think I'd like my money back.

48
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:45,013
<i>[Narrator] Like his father, George Michael</i>
<i>had been nursing an impossible crush.</i>

49
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,019
<i>It was on his cousin, Maeby.</i>

50
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:51,057
<i>And with no one to talk to,</i>
<i>he was looking for some kind of direction.</i>

51
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:53,752
just give me a sign.

52
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:59,260
[Chuckles]
First one's obvious. Okay.

53
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,969
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>He continued to look for a sign.</i>

54
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,937
- <i>Until finally</i>...
- "Maybe tonight."

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,031
[Chuckling]
What are the chances?

56
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:11,270
<i>[Narrator] Actually, "Maybe Tonight"</i>
<i>was a very popular candy slogan...</i>

57
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,278
<i>and the chances were one in eight.</i>

58
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,315
- What are you doin'?
- Just tryin' to throw stuff at my dad's head...

59
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,681
- but the wind keeps taking it.
- Oh, cool.

60
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,686
So, I, uh... I found this.

61
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:23,848
I thought it was like a one-in-a-million thing.
It just made me think of you.

62
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:28,054
- Oh, perfect.
- Trying to make my relation...

63
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:30,323
- I saw that.
- <i>[Narrator] And Lucille...</i>

64
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,127
<i>found a way to force a wedge</i>
<i>into her son's relationship.</i>

65
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:36,328
Lucille, guess who's coming to dinner?

66
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:39,929
I've invited Carl
to dine with us next Tuesday.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,235
Mother, you know
I have class on Tuesday.

68
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:46,143
Oh, how silly of me.

69
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:49,546
Well, then perhaps the two of you
can have dinner alone.

70
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,279
Oh, well, I never say no to dinner,
with a beautiful lady that is.

71
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:56,584
- Do you like ham?
- No. I love it.

72
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,488
[Laughing]

73
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,586
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And the family gathered to watch a videotape...</i>

74
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>George Sr. had sent Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>for their anniversary.</i>

75
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:10,036
Hello, I'm George Bluth...

76
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,628
and for the next 45 minutes...

77
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,106
let me take you on a journey...

78
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,372
Good grief. He sent us
one of his idiot videotapes.

79
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,414
- <i>[George] First this</i>...
- [Announcer] You've seen
George Bluth on videotape.

80
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:24,507
You have got to learn
to be alone.

81
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:28,110
I cheated and I lied.
And I whored around.

82
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:31,350
Caged Wisdom <i>changed my life.</i>

83
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,655
[Announcer] Now is your chance to own
the entire George Bluth <i>Caged Wisdom</i> library...

84
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:36,662
for only four payments of 19.95.

85
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:39,289
- This was supposed to be my anniversary toast.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,494
And this was supposed to be
my Valentine's Day party.

87
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,503
Speaking of which...

88
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,630
Lupe, where are those balloons?

89
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,799
<i>[Lupe]</i>
<i>You want balloons?</i>

90

93
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,181
- Come on, speech.
- Speech, speech, speech, speech...

94
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,726
<i>[Narrator] The family continued</i>
<i>to chant, "Speech, speech, speech'...</i>

95
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,159
<i>for no one in particular.</i>

96
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,527
- Speech, speech...
- All right.

97
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,532
Speech.

98
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,570
After all that, I was kinda hoping
somebody would make a speech.

99
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:21,664
- Speech, speech, speech...
- All right, all right, all right. I'll say something.

100
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,369
- Typical.
- <i>We've all had a tough couple of months.</i>

101
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,038
I think we're all really
figuring out who we are...

102
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,047
and what we really need in life.

103
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:31,845
<i>And that can be painful.</i>

104
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:35,683
However, you can't really heal yourself
until you stop living a lie, you know.

105
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,691
<i>But, uh, l-I promise that we're all</i>
<i>gonna be a lot happier in the long run.</i>

106
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:41,988
So, on a very unusual
Valentine's Day...

107
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:46,556
cheers to Mom and Dad,
to Buster and Lucille...

108
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,569
- [Chuckling] Don't forget my girlfriend.
- That's who I meant.

109
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,900
- [Chuckling] Don't forget my girlfriend.
- That's who I meant.

110
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:53,565
To Lindsay and Tobias,
to George Michael and...

111
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:56,438
I almost said George Michael and Maeby.
[Chuckles]

112
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:59,774
- Oh. [Laughing]
- Um, to Gob and Marta.

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,041
- Mmm.
- <i>To love and happiness.</i>

114
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,947
I love you all, Marta.

115
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,612
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Marta realized it was Michael, not Gob...</i>

116
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:10,781
<i>who had everything</i>
<i>she had been looking for in a man.</i>

117
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:13,553
I made a huge mistake.

118
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:22,132
<i>I was thinking about that toast</i>
<i>you gave at my anniversary party.</i>

119
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,262
- So, I want to get a divorce.
- What?

120
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:28,603
Do you think I should use our attorney, Barry,
or just kind of bolt in the night?

121
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,609
I'm leaning toward bolt
in the night, but...

122
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,441
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lindsay,
I wasn't talking about getting a divorce.

123
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:36,141
<i>Oh, Michael.</i>
<i>[Sighs] It's time.</i>

124
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,378
The man's psychologically incapable
of taking all of his clothes off.

125
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:42,887
<i>[Narrator] In fact,</i>
<i>Tobias was a never-nude.</i>

126
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,255
<i>As of yet, the D.S.M. -IV</i>
<i>has not acknowledged the affliction.</i>

127
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,454
I don't know, Lindsay.
I mean, who am I to judge?

128
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:51,497
On the other hand,
I am doing it anyway...

129
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,591
so let me suggest before you talk divorce,
at least consider a separation.

130
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,603
- You know, you do have a kid.
- I know.

131
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,299
I was gonna take her with me in the night.
She's part of the bolt.

132
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:02,307
Lindsay.

133
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,570
- All right. I'll think about it.
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>

134
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,949
- Hello?
- [Buster] Hey, brother.

135
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:12,109
I just want to tell you how much
I enjoyed your speech yesterday.

136
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,279
You know, about family and...
and being true to ourselves.

137
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,789
Oh, well, I'm...
I'm glad it made an impact.

138
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:21,088
Yeah. I never want
to look at Mom again.

139
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:23,129
[Sighs]
What happened?

140
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,927
Well, I can't really talk.
She might be listening in.

141
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:30,128
Do you know she tried to set up
my girlfriend with a <i>man?</i>

142
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:32,762
[Buster]
This has to stop.

143
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,773
You know, that's not really
what I was going for.

144
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,606
I'm a man, Mike!
I'm a man.

145
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:40,612
Can I throw out this yogurt?

146
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:42,614
Buster, two things.

147
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:45,184
First of all, I think it might be time
for you to move out, you know?

148
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,948
Secondly, you don't want to take any chances
with yogurt, Mom. Just let her throw it out.

149
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:52,116
- He-Hello? Who's on this phone?
- Hey. Huh?

150
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,727
- <i>[Gob] Michael?</i>
- Hey.

151
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:59,356
- Great speech last night.
- <i>Oh, really? What did it inspire</i>
<i>you to do, kill somebody?</i>

152
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,366
<i>Getting there.</i>
<i>Marta's cheating on me.</i>

153
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:03,698
- What?
- Yeah, can you believe that?

154
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:08,503
That's crazy, Gob. She's not a cheater.
If she were to cheat, I'd like to think she'd cheat...

155
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,907
- You're the cheater.
- That's how I know all the signs.

156
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,241
Last night she was all distant and weird.

157
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,406
Wouldn't let me make love to her
on Mom's bed.

158
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,974
I don't even want to tell you
what she wouldn't let me do to her in the car.

159
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:22,214
And then today, I overhear her talking on
the phone about somebody all super silently.

160
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,222
All in Spanish.

161
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:27,487
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Marta was on the phone</i>
<i>with her mother talking about Michael.</i>

- <i>[Whirring]</i>

[Marta]
<i>Hermano.</i>

165
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:38,327
She kept using this guy's name,
like, "Hermano."

166
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:42,170
Let me tell you something. We're gonna track
this "Hermano" down, and we're gonna nail him.

167
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:44,836
'Cause if anyone's gonna go out with that girl,
it's gonna be one of us.

168
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:48,506
- Right. Me.
- And I'm okay with that.

169
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:52,107
I don't get it.
Why do we have to change rooms?

170
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:55,211
Cousins of the opposite gender
shouldn't be sharing a room.

171
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:58,883
But that's just the point. I mean, we're cousins.
Gender has nothing to do with it.

172
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,859
I mean, cousins can bunk together.
That's why they call it "bunkin' cousins."

173
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:05,363
- "Kissin' cousins."
- We're not kissing! That's the point!

Besides, I don't even care. You said share
a room with her, I shared a room with her.

177
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,572
Now you're saying don't share a room
with her. Fine. I'm just doing whatever you say.

178
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,910
You know, the adults making all the decisions
around here. Why am I in trouble?

179
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,917
You're not in trouble. We're all just gonna have
a more normal arrangement.

180
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,388
I'm gonna sleep with my daughter,
and you're gonna sleep with my husband.

- Come on now. Wait a minute.

196
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:32,483
This is purely a social call. You know,
just two adults gettin' a stew on, man.

197
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:35,783
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds disgusting.

Gee, I thought you had class.

Wait a minute. Are you sure you're doing this
because you want to be with me...

203
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:56,536
- and not because you want
to get even with your mother?
- This isn't about my mother.

204
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:59,407
Besides, it's the only way
I'm ever gonna get her to respect me.

205
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:03,313
Buster, this is exactly why
our relationship does not work.

206
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:07,319
- Our relationship doesn't work?
- Not as long as you keep getting
me mixed up with your mother.

207
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:09,616
It is exactly the opposite.

For some reason
women feel safe around you.

285
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,902
Maybe because you've only
had sex four times.

286

Four women! Not four times!
And they talk to me because I talk to them.

00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:54,199
Yes, I'm the doctor.
The perfect husband.

316
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:57,395
The big manly man.
The big strong daddy.

317
00:16:57,504 --> 00:17:00,496
Do you know the last time
that I made love to my wife?

318
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,404
- No.
- I'll tell you when.

319
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,875
- No, don't.
- See, nothing has ever been easy for us.

320
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:08,106
<i>I mean, the only reason she went out with me</i>
<i>was to piss offher boyfriend.</i>

321
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:11,513
The only reason she ever married me
was to piss off her mother.

322
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:14,917
And then, of course, we couldn't conceive.
So there was that famous ordeal.

323
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:18,752
- Wh-What do you mean you couldn't
conceive? Was Maeby adopted?
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

324
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,986
What? Is she not really related to me?
Is she just some girl I know?

325
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:25,758
Ah, it's Carl Weathers.
Yes, Carl Weathers.

326
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,596
I did? That's... That's wonderful.

327
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:31,864

328
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:34,600
Huh! I booked it!
I booked the acting job!

329
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:39,042
Did you hear that, Lindsay? You could have been
sleeping with "Frightened Inmate #2."

330
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:46,015
<i>[Narrator] And Lucille was experiencing</i>

<i>Unable to sleep,</i>

332
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:53,851
[George]
You have got to learn to be alone.

<i>the answers he was looking for.</i>

341
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:26,214
So, um, about Gob.
How's that goin'?

342
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:28,988
Well, as you said...

343
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,825
finding out who you really are,
it can be painful.

344
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:34,764
- But you can't live a lie.
- No, I can't.

345
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:37,268
But some people find a way
to make that work.

346
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,533
Yes, but sometimes
working at something...

347
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,131
it's a way to not deal
with some other thing.

348
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:47,236
But he who often suggests...

349
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,247
uh, working on another thing...

350
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:52,113
- which when the first thing is not...
- Will you excuse me for a moment?

351
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,778
Yes. Sure.

352
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:58,289
- What the hell is he talking about?
- What is she talking about?

353
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,417
- Can I have a piece of cake?
- <i>[Narrator] And Michael saw an opportunity...</i>

354
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:04,861
<i>to get the information</i>
<i>he wasn't getting from Marta from her son.</i>

355
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:07,762
I'll tell you what.
I got... I got a deal for you, partner.

356
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:12,003
I'll give you what you want...

357
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:14,096
if you give me what I want.

358
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:18,769
Tell me everything
you know about... "Hermano."

359
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:21,608
-<i>? Hermano?</i>
- Does your mother love "Hermano?"

360
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:24,149
<i>Si, mi hermano.</i>

361
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,378
- He's here?
- Shh. He's sleeping.

362
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:33,522
- Don't go in there.
- Why? Is there something
you don't want me to see?

363
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:36,288
- What are you talking about?
- We can keep going around in circles...

364
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,956
but maybe one of us should just come out
and say what it is we want to say.

365
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,033
You're right.

366
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:44,626
- It's not working with Gob.
- Why doesn't he know that?

367
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:46,797
You know you could have
just come out and told him...

368
00:19:46,906 --> 00:19:49,875
you know, instead of lying and sneaking
around, moving on to the next guy.

369
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:53,742
I didn't think you were that kind of a person.
I thought you and I shared the same values.

370
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,247
I thought you and I
could've been, uh...

371
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:02,254
No, forget it. Eh... I don't know
how I had you so wrong.

372
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,880
You're right.

373
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,357
I should have told him
before I invited you here.

374
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:12,060
This can never be.

375
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:17,828

- What does "te amo" mean?
- I love you.

378
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:37,288
Hmm.

379
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,915
And who's in there?

380

Brother.

382
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:51,199

1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,965
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,443
<i>Michael Bluth and</i>
<i>his family had gathered at the courthouse...</i>

6
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:28,379
<i>to discuss George Sr. 's upcoming trial.</i>

7
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,609
Do not ask me how I did it...

8
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:33,118
they offered us a plea bargain.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,950
Really? There's a chance
we don't have to go to trial?

10
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,718
Absolutely, and I say we take it...

11
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:39,793
because we will never
get an offer this good again.

12
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:42,795
- Wow.
- Great. What's the offer?

13
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:46,458
Well, I didn't read it. I just got it yesterday.

14
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,263
F.Y.I., I'm trying to get back
into the dating world.

15
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:57,507
Hey, you're not one of those silly men
that's dressed like a woman, are you?

16
00:00:57,612 --> 00:00:59,876
No, baby. I'm the real thing.

17
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,682
I don't understand how a person
can put their sex life in front of their work.

18
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:08,221
He's a man, Michael. He needs a woman.

19
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,984
Can we get back to work, folks?

20
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:13,060
We've only got 24 hours to respond...

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,027
and no matter what this is,
it is better than going to trial.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,156
<i>Your father's not here. I'll speak for him.</i>

23
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,461
He loves it. He's crazy about the plea.

24
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,732
<i>He's dying to get out of that prison</i>
<i>and be with a woman again.</i>

25
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,864
<i>In fact, George Sr. had a woman in his life</i>...

26
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:30,375
<i>Cindi Lightballoon,</i>
<i>a fan ofhis</i> Caged Wisdom <i>video series...</i>

27
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,106
<i>with whom he'd had fleeting physical contact.</i>

28
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:36,377
<i>That morning however,</i>
<i>she had some startling news for him.</i>

29
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,543
I'm a mole.

30
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:42,214
Well, you know,
God doesn't care how big your teeth are.

31
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:44,484
Yes, you could go to a dentist.
You could... Whoo.

32
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:49,552
You could grind off about... I don't know...
30%, maybe more. Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

33
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:53,031
No, no, no.
I mean, I'm an undercover government agent.

34
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:55,602
I was sent here to investigate you.

35
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:59,400
Up until last week,
my being in love with you was just an act.

36
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:02,374
- Hmm.
- But now I want to be with you.

37
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:05,468
And I know you can beat this case
they have against you.

38
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,308
I know this for a fact.

39
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,577
I want to fight this thing.
I can beat it. I know it for a fact.

40
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,655
- We're taking the plea.
- Lucille, we're not taking a plea.

41
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:16,655
We don't even know what the plea is yet.

42
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:19,089
Is that a shot at me?
'Cause that makes me want to read it less.

43
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:21,024
- <i>You have another one of these?</i>
- Yes, I do.

44
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:23,323
- <i>We'll both read it.</i>
- You're going to read that?

45
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,762
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's pretty thick.

46
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:27,595
He thinks he's a lawyer
'cause he played one in 10th grade.

47
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:30,034
<i>In order to satisfy an English requirement...</i>

48
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,037
<i>Michael appeared</i>
<i>in the drama club's production...</i>

49
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,403
<i>of an original play,</i>
The Trial of Captain Hook.

50
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,215
- I don't remember that.
- Well, you left during my solo.

51
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,219
And I'm surprised my twin sister
can remember that...

52
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,154
considering she was repeating
the ninth grade at the time.

53
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,158
- I don't remember that.
- <i>Big surprise, Mom.</i>

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,160
It's not like you ever took an interest
in our lives.

55
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,924
Honestly, if I ever did to Maeby what you-

56
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:00,159
<i>Lindsay recalled that earlier that day...</i>

57
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:03,293
<i>she had received a letter from the high school</i>
<i>about her own daughter.</i>

58
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:11,772
<i>And so later, Lindsay and Tobias tried</i>
<i>a more hands-on approach to parenting.</i>

59
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,347
We would like you to tutor our daughter.

60
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:17,611
Now, of course,
we're having a bit of a cash-flow problem...

61
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,618
but I assure you...

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,620
if you bring our little girl's grades up...

63
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:25,283
I will pack your sweet pink mouth
with so much ice cream...

64
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:27,986
you'll be the envy
of everyJerry and Jane on the block.

65
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,495
We're the only house on the block.

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,698
Perhaps we should get somebody else.

67
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:38,636
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had gone to the bar</i>
<i>across the street from the courthouse...</i>

68
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,832
<i>to read the plea offer.</i>

69
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,273
"Not to exceed five years, but no less than three."

70
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:45,106
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

71
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:48,477
I'm so mad at Barry I can't even focus.
That guy's out dating?

72
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:51,346
- I mean, I'd love to be dating, but l...
- Can't relax?

73
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,819
No. I don't have time for a relationship.
This is important.

74
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,186
No one said anything about a relationship,
Michael.

75
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,191
If you'd slept with more than four women,
you'd know that.

76
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:02,353
- I have, Gob.
- More than five?

77
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:07,695
Let's say "five".
This is a courthouse bar, Michael.

78
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:09,770
These are professional, aggressive women...

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,464
who are looking for nothing more
than a one-night stand.

80
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:16,270
No real names, no promises.

81
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:19,540
I'm not a one-night stand kind of guy.
I don't like lying to women.

82
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:22,309
These are lawyers...
that's Latin for "liar."

83
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,350
I can't believe
I'm still reading the same sentence.

84
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:26,976
How can something be
"no less than three" if it exceeds six?

85
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:28,987
I mean, six is still more than three, right?

86
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:31,649
Yeah, and it's still more than five.

87
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,689
- Oh! Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

88
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,697
- I'm falling all over you.
- Let me move down.

89
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,790
I'm just working on this plea.

90
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:45,235
If you're pleading with me
to have a drink with you, you can stop begging.

91
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,933
No, no. It's a...

92
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:51,068
It's a plea for this case that I'm...
I'm sorry... you want a drink.

93
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:54,375
Well, I didn't come here for the view.

94
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:57,507
- I'll have a vodka martini.
- I'll tell him.

95
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:00,382
- So, another lawyer, huh?
- Vodka martini!

96
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:03,752
I'm Maggie Lizer,
as in "Maggie lies her ass off."

97
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:11,258
One person laughed at that once,
and I don't know why I keep trying it.

98
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:14,300
- No, it's good. Yeah.
- What kind of law do you practice?

99
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:21,608
Maritime. Maritime law.
Lawyers of the sea.

100
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,109
Oh. Submarine chaser.

101
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,406
What's your name?

102
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:28,481
- Chareth.
- Chareth.

103
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,447
Oh. So then what's your last name?

104
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:33,019
- Cute story...
- Cutestory?

105
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,580
Yes. Chareth Cutestory.

106
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,126
- That's an interesting name.
- Is it?

107
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:43,287
So here's the test that I failed.

108
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,991
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I see the problem right away.

109
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,000
You, uh...
You got all the answers wrong.

110
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:51,902
You know you, you even got your name
wrong here. It says, "S. Fünke."

111
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,099
Yeah, well, see, what they want you to do...

112
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,199
is put an "S" if you're single,
an "M" if you're married.

113
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,973
I mean, most of us are all single,
but it's a whole government thing, so...

114
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,106
Yeah. Okay. The first thing you want to do
when you're dealing with fractions...

115
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:04,485
<i>Yeah. So I'm gonna go, okay?</i>

116
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:05,383
<i>Yeah. So I'm gonna go, okay?</i>

117
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:09,547
So just fill in all the right answers here,
and I'll see where I went wrong.

118
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:11,557
And you're getting paid for this right?

119
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,526
There was talk of ice cream,
but not exactly on my terms.

120
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,392
Wow! Where did you get all that?
Do you have a job or something?

121
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:20,490
No, but you do.

122
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,831
Now, look. Don't feel guilty.

123
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:25,371
I don't really need tutoring anyways, okay?

124
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:28,532
- Enjoy the 200 bucks.
- Oh, there... there's six 20s here.

125
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:32,169
- That's right.
- Right.

126
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,214
<i>After an evening of drinking,</i>
<i>Michael, being the sensible one...</i>

127
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,216
<i>offered to give Maggie a ride home.</i>

128
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:40,378
Oh-ho!

129
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,326
<i>The next morning, Michael was wondering...</i>

130
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,828
<i>how to end his first one-night stand.</i>

131
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:54,526
- <i>Coffee?</i>
- Hi. Yes, please. Thank you. That's great.

132
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:59,663
But you know what? I am going to have to
read that plea soon, okay? 'Cause it's a big case.

133
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:01,832
But I promise later I will call...

134
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:05,207
<i>Michael struggled to follow Gob's</i>
<i>instruction tojust walk away.</i>

135
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,213
I'll... I'll... I'll call, okay?
All right?

136
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:10,840
- Hey. Who's this?
- Oh, that's Justice.

137
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:15,320
- Hi, Justice.
- Hi, Justice. Is he as handsome as he smells?

138
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:17,822
I didn't... I didn't know that you had a dog.

139
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:21,520
- How else am I gonna get to work?
- You ride a dog to work?

140
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:25,758
You are funny. Let me see that smile.

141
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:29,563
Well, it's tough with your hands in the way.

142
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,070
- Say when.
- Okay.

143
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:38,537
<i>And suddenly, Michael recalled</i>
<i>some non sequiturs from the night before.</i>

144
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,875
So, tell me something personal
about yourself.

145
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:45,213
Uh, well, I have an irreversible case
of ocular retinoblastoma.

146
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,446
Hey. I thought we said no more law talk.

147
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,545
I really can't see anybody right now.

148
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:52,250
Oh, well, I can't see anybody ever.

149
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:56,261
- I'm blind.
- I'm wasted.

150
00:07:56,363 --> 00:08:00,891
<i>Michael realized that the woman</i>
<i>he was attempting to never see again was blind...</i>

151
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,128
<i>and he was overcome with guilt.</i>

152
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:05,797
- When... can we go out again?
- Really?

153
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:09,034
I thought you were, like,
just into this one-night stand kind of thing.

154
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:12,635
Come on. I took a blind woman
home with no intention of dating her again?

155
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:14,771
Please!

156
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:24,089
<i>George Sr. was continuing</i>
<i>to exploit his relationship with Cindi.</i>

157
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:27,592
What... What evidence
does the government have...

158
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:29,992
on old wise George, by the way?

159
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:33,032
Oh, I hate it when you call yourself old!

160
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,931
- You're new to me!
- Oh, that's... that's nice.

161
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:39,528
Do they have a... a file or tapes?

162
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,938
Oh, what's the use?
You're married.

163
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,942
- Yeah. Let me ask you...
- We'll never be together.

164
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,842
- Let me ask you a question.
- Let's just go back to what we do best.

165
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,108
- Okay.
- Tweak me.

166
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,650
- George!
- Lucille!

167
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,652
Hi. Uh, this is not what it looks like.

168
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,723
It looks like you're tweaking her nipples
through a chain-link fence.

169
00:08:56,824 --> 00:09:00,555
- Yep. Yeah, that's it.
- Is this why you wanted to fight this thing?

170
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,630
So you could run off
with this great redwood of a whore?

171
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,790
Listen to me. She is a fan of mine.

172
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,132
She has seen everything I've done.
You understand? Everything.

173
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,229
Well, so have I...

174
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,570
and I'm not going to put up with it anymore.

175
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,974
- Okay.
- You'll be hearing from Barry.

176
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,013
All right. Hon?
Honey? Hon?

177
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,149
- Oh, God. I'm a home-wrecker.
- Oh, no.

178
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,310
- I never wanted to be that person.
- No, no.

179
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,820
No. No, Cindi, it's... Cindi?

180
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:33,325
<i>Michael came home upset that</i>
<i>his one-night stand wasn't over.</i>

181
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,327
You should have stayed with me last night.

182
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:39,832
You could have seen me
get some major action from a major blonde...

183
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,367
who just majored in marine biology,
if you know what I mean.

184
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:45,267
I don't know what you mean.
I can't imagine what that means.

185
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:48,205
- I actually had a pretty interesting night myself.
- Really?

186
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:52,176
- What'd you do, read the plea?
- No, I didn't have a chance to.
I went home with someone.

187
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,510
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her.

188
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:01,049
- She's blind.
- Are you serious?

189
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:05,956
I didn't know at the time. And now
I've got to take her and her dog to the park.

190
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,027
You've got work to do.
You've got to read that plea.

191
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:11,359
I know. That's what I was trying to do last night
when you put me up to all this.

192
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,365
- <i>No, I didn't.</i>
- Yes, you did.

193
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,368
I told you to walk away.
I told you to give a fake name.

194
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,372
I did. Thanks very much.
I'm Chareth Cutestory, a pirate lawyer.

195
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:24,376
- It was airtight.
- Boy, you had to work hard
to bag this blind girl, huh?

196
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:27,208
- I certainly can't take advantage of her now,
knowing what I know.
- What? No.

197
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,544
Michael, you can! Don't you...

198
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,642
You've just won the gold medal
at the sexual Special Olympics!

199
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:36,814
She can't ever find you again.
Don't you see that you're so lucky?

200
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:40,087
- God! How do you not s...
- What's the matter with you?

201
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:44,130
- Didn't you "bag" some woman
you're never going to see again?
- Well, I screwed up.

202
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,563
I broke a couple of my own rules last night.

203
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,601
She knows that I'm Gob Bluth...

204
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:51,569
and we got married and I just...

205
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:54,539
- What?
- Well, she was a darer.

206
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:57,439
She's one of those girls
who just dares you to do things.

207
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:00,138
- You married her?
- I needed a dare!

208
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,511
<i>What had started as an innocent flirtation...</i>

209
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,176
<i>had turned into a series</i>
<i>of escalating challenges.</i>

210
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:08,584
<i>Unfortunately, the evening was draining...</i>

211
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:11,590
<i>and the one thing they never dared each other</i>
<i>to do was consummate the marriage.</i>

212
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,092
Well, guess it's time to seal the deal.

213
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,992
Oh, wait! What time is it?
Oh, God! "Seal the deal."

214
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:19,588
My seal deal! I gotta get to Sea Land.

215
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,635
I'm selling five of their sickest seals
to a third-world zoo.

216
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:26,536
- Did you say seals?
- Yes! I told you four hours ago, I sell seals!

217
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,540
God! Do you ever listen to what I say?

218
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:31,110
I'm sorry I don't memorize every word
that comes out of your mouth.

219
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,305
Sometimes I just like to think...
think my thoughts.

220
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,882
We'll talk about this when I get home.

221
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:39,111
It was hot.

222
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:41,779
Boy, the lengths you'll go
to sleep with a woman.

223
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:44,789
Believe me, we didn't do any sleeping.
I had sex last night.

224
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:47,485
- <i>But he really didn't.</i>
- Yes, I did.

225
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:49,789
<i>And later, Michael arrived for his date.</i>

226
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,830
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry that I'm late.

227
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:55,129
- I thought I smelled you coming.
- Mm. Yeah, here I am.

228
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,135
I thought so. Did you smell him?

229
00:11:57,237 --> 00:12:00,206
- Did you smell the handsome man, Justice?
- "Handsome."

230
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,969
- You don't have any evidence of handsome.
- Well, that's true.

231
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:05,374
But I can feel handsome.

232
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,480
- Mmm.
- That feels handsomey.

233
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,710
- Mmm.
- That feels handsomey.

234
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:12,649
So you didn't get a case of"I just had
a one-night stand with a blind girl"-itus?

235
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,983
No, of course not.
One-night stand? Please!

236
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,988
This is our second date now.
And I wanna see...

237
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,854
And I wanna see you again tonight, so, um...

238
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,656
if it's a one-night stand, I'm not very good at it.

239
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:25,994
But now, listen, aren't you busy with the trial?

240
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:29,694
Um, yes, of course. I'm very, very busy.
But not too busy for you.

241
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,703
Not too busy for a little walk right now maybe.

242
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,705
I'll be your Seeing Eye dog.
What do you think?

243
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:36,275
- Okay?
- Oh. Should we leaveJustice here?

244
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,903
Um, yes. He'll be fine, won't you, boy? Huh?

245
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:43,676
<i>Justice, stay! Stay!</i>

246
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:46,344
Describe this to me, Chareth.

247
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,853
Describe to me how beautiful the park is.

248
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,015
Oh, I wish you could see it. It's just beautiful.

249
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,458
There's an elderly couple walking hand in hand.

250
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,860
- They're having a wonderful time.
- Yeah?

251
00:12:57,964 --> 00:13:02,765
"Already served, not to exceed six years
but no less than three..."

252
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:06,737
Uh, three years is what I give them...

253
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,071
and then one of them dies
and the other one is not too far behind.

254
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:13,476
I can smell right through you, Chareth.
You're reading.

255
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,741
Leash your dog,
you...

256
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,249
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

257
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:21,048
<i>And George Sr. was working</i>
<i>on a roadside beautification effort...</i>

258
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:22,883
<i>brokered by Warden Stefan Gentles.</i>

259
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:25,321
- Inmate Bluth.
- Yes, sir?

260
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,325
I want you to know that last night...

261
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:31,056
I watched a very impressive videotape
of the title <i>Caged Wisdom.</i>

262
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:34,998
I was struck by the dual life
of the spiritual man.

263
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:40,005
And I did very much enjoy the blooper bonus
footage at the end.

264
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:42,905
Well, you know, I almost did strangle myself
on my own prayer shawl.

265
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,068
A self-choking for the ages.

266
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:48,306
- There's a Shasta can there
you seemed to have missed.
- Okay.

267
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,315
- <i>Moments later, Cindi arrived.</i>
- Thank you, Warden.

268
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,749
George! I had to see you.

269
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:56,448
I'm sorry I left before. I just felt so awful.

270
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:58,786
But I kept thinking about us.

271
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,792
- Yes.
- About our future.

272
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:03,260
- Yes, l...
- And I know for a fact we can have one.

273
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:05,524
Okay. What evidence do they have on me?

274
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:08,931
You keep talking about a fact?
You keep saying, "I know for a fact."

275
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,503
- What fact?
- Faith.

276
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:15,837
I have faith my prayers will free you.

277
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,934
- Faith is not a fact!
- Oh, yes, it is.

278
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,707
You said so yourself in <i>Caged Wisdom.</i>

279
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:24,511
<i>George Sr. had said "Faith is a fact."</i>

280
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:28,145
<i>Unfortunately, it was in the</i> Caged Wisdom
<i>blooper bonus footage.</i>

281
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:31,622
Faith is a fact.
No. Faith is a facet.

282
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:34,888
I almost said faith is a fact.

283
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:40,797
I am going to trial because you don't
understand what a blooper reel is? Guard!

284
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:47,704
<i>Back at the high school,</i>
<i>George Michael ran into Maeby.</i>

285
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,708
I got an "A."
Check it out.

286
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,675
Great job. Take some more money.

287
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:54,804
Look. I gotta go.
I'm going to this fund-raiser for a sick girl, okay?

288
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,974
<i>This rang false to George Michael...</i>

289
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,847
<i>who knew that fund-raisers,</i>
<i>a passion ofher mother's...</i>

290
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:02,183
<i>were something that Maeby would avoid.</i>

291
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,280
<i>And later, at the courthouse</i>...

292
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:07,155
- Good afternoon.
- Thank God.

293
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,320
So did you read the plea?
We've got minutes here, not hours.

294
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,024
I did read it. Most of it. Um, I definitely...

295
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:17,001
definitely read this, uh...
the first part of this first, uh, section.

296
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,628
- Uh, no. Did not read it.
- <i>Oh, come on, Michael.</i>

297
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,639
<i>How many times are you going to screw up...</i>

298
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:24,539
before the rest of this family
sees you for the screwup you are?

299
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,544
I'm not the lawyer. All right?
Why didn't you read it?

300
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,637
Excuse me.
I got busy with my other clients.

301
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:30,716
- What other clients?
- He doesn't know about the divorce?

302
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,308
- It's an annulment.
- Oh, I looked into that too.

303
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,981
<i>You can only get an annulment</i>
<i>if you haven't consummated the marriage first.</i>

304
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,150
Well, I guess I'll just stay married then...

305
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,959
because we all know
that I closed that deal, right?

306
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,965
<i>But he really didn't.</i>

307
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,194
- He was talking about my divorce.
- Your what?

308
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:51,202
You and Dad are getting divorced?

309
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,704
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.
No one is fighting over you.

310
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:56,367
And don't worry about Barry reading the plea.

311
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,444
We'll let your father rot in prison.

312
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,513
Take the plea. We're taking the plea!

313
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:03,845
<i>We're going to trial, you're going to lose,</i>
<i>and you're going to stay in there.</i>

314
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,386
- That's enough, Mom.
- For him? Nothing's enough.

315
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:11,048
You'd think a man locked up in prison
would be able to abstain.

316
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:15,389
Your father, with his disgusting tweaking!

317
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:17,895
I couldn't breast-feed any of you kids
because of that man!

318
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,022
- Aww!
- Shh.

319
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,123
They still look fabulous.

320
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:24,067
Lucille, for God's sakes. She was an informant.
She was working for the government.

321
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,071
<i>The only thing I was pumping her</i>
<i>for was information, honey.</i>

322
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:30,336
<i>An informant. Dad, are you crazy?</i>
<i>You're gonna blow this whole case.</i>

323
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:34,539
It's blown. It's over. It's dead.
Take the plea. Get me out there.

324
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:37,378
Lets take the plea, okay?
Look. It's so nice and thick.

325
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:41,079
<i>Oh, George, I should have never doubted you.</i>

326
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:44,156
Even when you slept with my sister,
it was for a good reason.

327
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:46,054
Got her to stop drinking, didn't it?

328
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,423
<i>All right, listen.</i>
<i>This is all getting a little crazy.</i>

329
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:51,463
We cannot accept their conditions
if we don't know what their conditions are.

330
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:53,829
Do you wanna read it?

331
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,562
Uh, no. It is thick. Why don't we just take it?

332
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,400
- I could kiss you on the...
- Well, let's... What?

333
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,440
<i>And so the family gathered in the courtroom...</i>

334
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,441
<i>to announce their decision.</i>

335
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:06,410
<i>All rise. The court is now in session.</i>

336
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:08,344
The Honorable Lionel Ping presiding.

337
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:10,348
Oh, we've got Ping again.

338
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,748
<i>Please be seated.</i>

339
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,787
The prosecution has offered a plea?

340
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:20,292
- We have, Your Honor.
- We've got Lizer.

341
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:24,591
<i>Yes, Maggie was the most feared</i>
<i>prosecutor in all of Orange County.</i>

342
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:29,635
And, therefore, I would like to
bring your attention to Exhibit A.

343
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:32,466
<i>Not because she was</i>
<i>a particularly adept lawyer...</i>

344
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,973
<i>but because she won the sympathy</i>
<i>not only of thejury and thejudge...</i>

345
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:41,639
And was that man in the room, not you, Doctor?

346
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:44,478
<i>but often times, the defendants themselves.</i>

347
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:47,109
l... I was in that room.

348
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,347
Is the defense ready to respond?

349
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:52,118
- What are you hiding from?
- You've got to call this off.

350
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,989
<i>You gotta get more time.</i>
<i>Get more time. She can smell me.</i>

351
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,063
She smells everything.

352
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,836
- Objection!
- What?

353
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:06,337
We haven't read it.

354
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,669
- It's very long, Your Honor.
- Sit down!

355
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:11,903
We haven't read it. We're gonna get to it.
I'm gonna start right now.

356
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,482
That's the blind chick you slept with?

357
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:16,380
That's the blind chick you slept with?

358
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,508
Michael, you're in bed with the prosecution?

359
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:21,678
It's genius.
You can get all the information we need.

360
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,518
Wait a minute. How do we know it's not a trap?
Maybe she's setting you up.

361
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:28,025
It's not a setup, okay? She gave me her real name.
She said that she was a lawyer.

362
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:30,221
I'm the one that lied to her.
I gotta go talk to her.

363
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,730
- No!
- No, Michael! You can save this family.

364
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:35,699
Please! Do the right thing here.

365
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:39,670
String this blind girl along so that
Dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society.

366
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:43,766
The solution to all our problems is staring you
right in the face and it can't even see you.

367
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:46,209
I gotta go talk to her.

368
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:48,940
Yeah, I better get back to the wife.

369
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:53,748
I think I'm going to take a scenic drive down
to the City of Industry.

370
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,753
<i>And George Michael went to the fund-raiser...</i>

371
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:57,755
<i>for the sick student Maeby had mentioned...</i>

372
00:18:57,857 --> 00:18:59,757
<i>but was surprised not to see Maeby there.</i>

373
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,853
We have been blessed to have in our midst a
child who has shown us the meaning of courage.

374
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:08,422
Now let's show her the meaning of charity.

375
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,368
Please welcome...
Surely Fünke!

376
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,564
<i>And that's when George Michael realized...</i>

377
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:17,871
<i>Maeby had been making money</i>
<i>by pretending to be two twin girls</i>...

378
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:19,376
Maeby?

379
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:22,744
<i>one of whom was ill.</i>

380
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,578
Somebody get her a cupcake!

381
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:28,245
<i>And Michael went to Maggie's</i>
<i>determined to tell the truth.</i>

382
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:31,323
What a surprise. Come on in.

383
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,922
- Hey, I'm in. Hello. Sorry.
- Oh. Hey.

384
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:38,122
- I thought you were going to be my reader.
- Yeah? Oh, you're working?

385
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:41,962
Yeah, I got a break.
I wasn't prepared, thanks to you.

386
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,127
Mm.

387
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:48,105
What about you? Don't tell me
another pirate is still roaming the high seas.

388
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:54,442
Uh, hey. You know, let's make a deal.

389
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:57,072
You don't have to do this anymore,
cause I'm gonna start laughing out loud.

390
00:19:57,183 --> 00:20:01,085
- Okay. That's gonna help me so much.
- All right. Let's go sit down.

391
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,280
- So, uh, Maggie.
- Yeah?

392
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:07,155
I am not trying a case.

393
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,354
- That's fantastic! They settled. Great.
- Well...

394
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:13,955
Listen, I know I shouldn't do this, but...

395
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:18,766
but I am so behind,
and I really do feel as if I can trust you.

396
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,635
Yeah? What is this?

397
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,208
Well, you ought to know. You can see.

398
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,869
Maggie!

399
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:28,106
- What is it? Seriously.
- Well, basically...

400
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:31,650
it's an overview of the government's case
against the Bluth family.

401
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:34,652
It's a summary of absolutely everything we've got.

402
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:36,654
And you're just going to give it to me?

403
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,815
You're a lawyer. What do you think?

404
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,825
Do we have a case?

405
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:46,192
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

406
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,460
<i>Maeby attempts</i>
<i>to deposit her check.</i>

407
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,899
- <i>Gob adapts to married life.</i>
- Unbelievable!

408
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:56,100
The seal deal fell through. Three
of the seals died on their way to Chad.

409
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,177
How am I ever gonna find
a maritime lawyer?

410
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,212
- I'm sorry, did you say "seals"?
- Yes!

411
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:02,281
I trade trained
seals for a living.

412
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:04,646
- Do you ever listen?
- Do you ever stop talking?

413
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:08,551
<i>Tobias is sent to break into</i>
<i>Maggie's house to steal evidence.</i>

414
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:19,664
<i>Only to discover</i>
<i>that she's not blind.</i>

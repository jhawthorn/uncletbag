1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,510
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>was getting ready for school...</i>

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,681
<i>when he came across a box</i>
<i>oflove letters he'd written...</i>

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,352
<i>but never sent</i>
<i>to his cousin Maeby.</i>

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,191
<i>One letter titled "If You Weren't My Cousin,"</i>

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,197
<i>was particularly incriminating.</i>

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,267
Hey, pal, you want a ride to school?

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,768
Um, no. Actually, I'm-

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,032
I'm riding with the Veals, Ann's parents.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,667
You don't need to be penned up with them.
I'll drive you both. We'll take the stairs.

14
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,473
<i>Right. Here's the thing though.</i>
<i>It's kind of cramped in there.</i>

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,946
<i>Plus, a lot ofkids are still talking about when</i>
<i>you took down that homecoming banner.</i>

16
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,119
Listen, are you embarrassed
to be seen in that car?

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,381
It's not a car. But- But, no.

18
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,918
I've got to get a new car.

19
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,928
<i>George Michael decided</i>
<i>to hide the love letters in the attic...</i>

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,930
<i>although Maeby</i>
<i>had her own problems.</i>

21
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,932
<i>After lying about her age...</i>

22
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,868
<i>she had conned her way into a job</i>
<i>as a movie studio executive.</i>

23
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,236
Did you get the stack of scripts that I sent you?
'Cause you certainly look well-rested.

24
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,401
- Marry me.
- Ha! I need your notes on those tomorrow.

25
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,139
- Wanna have a drink?
- Yeah. Why don't we ask your wife
to come with us?

26
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,408
Okay, then.
I'll see you tomorrow.

27
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,280
<i>And downstairs, Buster paid a visit.</i>

28
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,651
- Hey, Brother. I need a favor.
- Of course you do.

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,247
I'm on furlough this week, and
everybody's out dancing with their girl...

30
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,259
- and I'm home sitting with Mom.
- Mom doesn't wanna go dancing?

31
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,262
I think the age difference
is really starting to catch up to us.

32
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,924
Maybe it's time you got out there
and started meeting people, you know?

33
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,333
Meetin' women. Meetin' women
who didn't give birth to you.

34
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,931
- Maybe you could go with me.
- Not really what I meant-
I have a very busy schedule now.

35
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:53,706
<i>My schedule, however, is as open</i>
<i>as my relationship with my wife.</i>

36
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,475
So why don't we pair up?

37
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,448
<i>And-And hit the town together.</i>

38
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,542
- Oh.
- I'll be your wingman.

39
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,953
Even if it means
me taking a chubby, I will suck it up.

40
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,253
Boy, that's enough
family stuff for today.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,386
<i>That's right, Michael.</i>
<i>Guess whojust got fired.</i>

42
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,728
<i>Gob was recently hired</i>
<i>by the Bluth Company's rival...</i>

43
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,733
<i>Sitwell Enterprises.</i>

44
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,828
- <i>Although he started off well</i>-
- Fifty-two percent of the country is single.

45
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,635
That's a market that's been
dominated by apartment rentals.

46
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,406
<i>Let's take some of that market.</i>
<i>I call it Single City.</i>

47
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,641
<i>His ideas failed to evolve.</i>

48
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,650
It's like, "Hey, you wanna
go down to the whirlpool?"

49
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,312
"Yeah. I don't have a husband."
I call it Swing City.

50
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,083
Let's get into some new
areas, if you don't mind.

51
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,490
<i>But Gob continued</i>
<i>to fine-tune his first one.</i>

52
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,494
How do we filter out the teases?

53
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,587
We don't let them in.

54
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,598
This goes for the guys too...

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,725
because sometimes the guys
are tapped out.

56
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,432
But check your lease, man,
because you're livin' in- City.

57
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,509
- You're fired.
- <i>So get this.</i>

58
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,304
I took his dress eyebrows.

59
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,676
<i>Sitwell suffered from a disease</i>
<i>that rendered him completely hairless.</i>

60
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,011
He's not gonna be happy about that.

61
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,052
No, especially when he goes to the opera
with two mustaches on his forehead.

62
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,179
Oh, but the good news is:
I'm coming back to the Bluth Company.

63
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,851
Gob, we're gettin' all jammed up here, okay?

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,554
The only reason that you were president
was to appease the board.

65
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,563
They've been appeased.
I got the job.

66
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,931
No, I don't need to be president.
I just liked having an office, a title.

67
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,799
- Sure.
- Paycheck.

68
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,362
Also I need a company car.
You do have to match Sitwell there.

69
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,237
Hang on. He gave you
a company car?

70
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,039
Yeah. And it was way better than any
of the company cars Dad ever gave me.

71
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,614
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, the Camaro was okay.

72
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,213
Are you serious?
Dad gave you the Camaro?

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,255
I thought you won that
on <i>Card Sharks.</i>

74
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,952
Michael, I was never on <i>Card Sharks.</i>
Dad told us not to tell you.

75
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,495
<i>Michael decided to confront his father...</i>

76
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,589
<i>who'd been living in the attic</i>
<i>since he'd escaped from prison.</i>

77
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,260
- Dad?
- Oh, thank God you're here.

78
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,837
I'm going crazy
with the boredom, Michael.

79
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,998
At least in prison, we had knife fights,
and we had movie night.

80
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,772
And once both. Those men did not enjoy <i>Soapdish.</i>
I think you have to know that world.

81
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,815
Yeah, listen, did you buy a company car
for everyone in the family except me?

82
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,078
Well, according to the books,
I gave you four.

83
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,848
I'm serious. I'm driving
a staircase, for God's sake.

84
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,946
It smells like gas.
I get hop-ons.

85
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,992
- Well, of course you're gonna get hop-ons.
- I pull down banners, all right?

86
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,291
And most importantly, Dad,
my son does not like to be seen in it.

87
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,627
But he likes being seen with that girl.

88
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,099
- It makes no sense, I know.
- It doesn't.

89
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,602
I never gave you a-a company car.

90
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,138
No, I gave you something
far more important.

91
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,970
I gave you company, which, apparently,
you don't want to give to me.

92
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,239
- You're not listening to me.
I'd love to sit and chat, but...
- I'm lonely up here.

93
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,247
I've got to get an early start.
I'm expecting headwinds on the stair car.

94
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,217
You see anybody here? You could bring me
a book. Pop-Pop gets a Grisham?

95
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,380
So you take your mom to work
every day? Bummer.

96
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,017
Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh?
It's like "Die already!"

97
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,493
- I love my mother.
- Huh?

98
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,292
She's one of the two most
important people in my life.

99
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,299
You know, she and Quincy.

100
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,632
<i>A spokesman</i>
<i>for Mr. Jones denies they've ever met...</i>

101
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,697
<i>although he could not explain the six</i>
<i>signed gold records in Starla's apartment.</i>

102
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,835
I could never be with a man
who doesn't love his mother.

103
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,810
- Oh.
- Wow.

104
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,680
So, Michael, listen. I'm here
to convince you to hire me back.

105
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think
I proved that with- Mountain.

106
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,388
Listen, I want this, Michael.

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,685
I'm gonna prove to you that
I'm worthy of rehiring...

108
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,762
if it takes every ounce of
determination that I've got.

109
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,164
Where are you going?

110
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,826
Did you want me
to stay and do that?

111
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,168
- Barry.
- Good news and even better news.

112
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,175
Your company's stock is unfrozen...

113
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,177
and my lawsuit against
the L.A. Kings is moving forward.

114
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,180
- How did that happen?
- Maybe a puck hit me. It could happen.

115
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:54,276
No, the stock. Now, that means we can sell,
right? We can do whatever we want with it?

116
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,356
I'll tell you one thing you don't want to do
is buy stock in the L.A. Kings.

117
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,584
Do you think I could sell
enough to buy a car?

118
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,559
I thought you had four.
Oh, you mean a real one. Yeah, sure.

119
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,392
You can get one, as long as everyone
doesn't sell the company stock at once.

120
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,365
<i>You don't want someone else</i>
<i>to get control of the company.</i>

121
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,029
Right. Gotta keep the company intact, right?
The other people shouldn't risk selling their-

122
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,971
Maybe you can draft up
a letter to the investors:

123
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,907
<i>"Yes, the stock is unfrozen.</i>
<i>We urge you not to sell."</i>

124
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,537
Uh, yeah. Wh-What you just said was
perfect. Why do you want me to write it?

125
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,583
Just send it out on your stationery.
And do it quickly. I have a car to buy.

126
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,917
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby snuck</i>
<i>upstairs to secretly read her scripts.</i>

127
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,482
Ow! Back to film school-

<i>to have something to read.</i>

130
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,565
That's a bad title.

131
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,402
<i>Meanwhile, Michael went to get</i>
<i>a good deal on a modest company car.</i>

132
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,637
Oh, something like this?
We have, like, 400 of these.

133
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,940
L- I don't need
anything too popular.

134
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,981
Oh, they're not popular.
We have 400 of them.

135
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,983
Sold.

136
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,488
Although, uh, I'm wondering if maybe
it should just be a little bit nicer.

137
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,956
I got a kid, and safety's kind of
a factor. But nothing too flashy.

138
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,995
This is it, isn't it?
I can tell. You're excited.

139
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,065
- I am.
- I'll draw up the papers.

140
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,329
Unless you think it's too drab.

141
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,336
And it gets very good mileage.

142
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,339
Yeah, well, it, uh- it looks light.

143
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,534
You know, I'm not
so concerned about mileage.

144
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,135
I spent the last 10 years on a bike,
with the exception of the stair car.

145
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,874
Oh, you're the stair car guy.
You took down our banner.

146
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,008
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a hop-on.

147
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,451
I got distracted.
I hate this.

148
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,649
I like these sunglasses.
They come with any car?

149
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,558
Just this one. They throw these extras
at you because it's so impractical.

150
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,857
No back seat.
It attracts so many tickets...

151
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,626
the insurance alone costs as much
as the last three cars we saw.

152
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,633
The windbreaker?
Windbreaker comes with it too?

153
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,363
I guess. I don't know. I've never
sold one of these before, so-

154
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,202
I'll take it.

155
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,637
<i>Michael hadjust indulged</i>
<i>himself with an expensive sports car</i>-

156
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,648
And here again, please.

157
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,981
<i>While Buster indulged</i>
<i>in a night out with Tobias.</i>

158
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,317
This place is exactly
what I had hoped for.

159
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,483
- All ladies.
- Mmm.

160
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,153
Well, I've heard that this uniform
is the best way to meet-

161
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,231
- Lucille 2!
- Buster!

162
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,733
- So you're back.
- Oh, I'm back, Buster!

163
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,396
- Yeah?
- And I am rock steady! No more dizzies.

164
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,872
<i>Lucille Austero hadjust returned...</i>

165
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:33,912
<i>from a month-long stay at a facility that</i>
<i>specialized in the treatment of vertigo.</i>

166
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,210
Ah. Ah, just a minute. You're okay.

167
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,716
You're okay. You're okay.
We're okay. We're okay!

168
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,118
Somebody'll be here in a second.
We're okay. We're okay.

169
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,190
I am stable as a table.

170
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,455
So, is there a-
a girl in your life?

171
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,123
Well, I would hardly
call my mother a girl.

172
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,462
But, yeah, she's still
very much a part of my life.

173
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:59,595
No, I mean, uh, someone
who makes you hear music.

174
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,674
Oh. Well, she mostly
likes talk radio.

175
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,474
I mean, a girl who
makes you feel romantic...

176
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,913
and also who makes you
hear beautiful music.

177
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,076
Oh. No.

178
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:17,087
I guess what I'm trying to say is-

179
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,391
Everybody thinks
they're Frank Sinatra.

180
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,829
- Maybe we could start anew.

181
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,167
<i>And later, Michael got</i>
<i>an urgent call from his mother.</i>

182
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,436
He's with her again.
Buster's taken up with that Lucille 2.

183
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,443
That's why you called me here?

184
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,207
I've got my secretary bringing over
a bunch of important papers.

185
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,749
- I thought this was urgent.
- Well, it's all your fault.

186
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,751
You're the one who insisted
he get away from Mother.

187
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,754
Well, I wasn't trying to send him
to a new one. Where is he?

188
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,756
He's on the balcony.

189
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,554
Buster?

190
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,856
Mom's becoming a little controlling.

191
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,432
<i>What tripped you off? When she</i>
<i>locked you out on the balcony again?</i>

192
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,526
That was half my fault. I thought
I saw a graham cracker out there.

193
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,800
- <i>You baited the balcony?</i>
- Prove it.

194
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,239
<i>So I don't typically</i>
<i>take sides with Mother...</i>

195
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,073
but l-l-I do agree that Lucille 2...

196
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,307
might not be
the best choice for you.

197
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,111
I wouldn't even have been there
if Mom wanted to go bowling.

198
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,618
How am I gonna meet someone
who has my interests?

199
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,279
- Hi, Michael.
- Hey. Great.

200
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,289
- I have those papers for you to sign.
- Perfect.

201
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,552
<i>By the way, I love your mother.</i>

202
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,026
- Oh, yeah, I do too.
- Oh.

203
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,267
I think I may have found
a new girl for Buster.

204
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,270
Good. That Lucille isn't really
interested in Buster anyway.

205
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,808
- She's just trying to get even with me.
- Get even with you for what?

206
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,503
She wanted me to let in her remodeling
crew while she was out of town.

207
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,843
Wait a minute. This tub's
a little bigger than it used to be.

208
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,510
<i>It was.</i>
<i>Instead ofletting the construction crew...</i>

209
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,519
- <i>into Lucille Austero's penthouse</i>-
- Come right in.

210
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,351
<i>Lucille had put them to work</i>
<i>on a project ofher own.</i>

211
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,661
- What'd you do?
- Well, I sat on one of these jets.

212
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,290
<i>- But I think we can fix it.</i>
- Don't give me that look.

213
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,166
I moved the wall a couple
of inches into her penthouse.

214
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,865
Don't think she's not over there
right now, plotting her revenge.

215
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,769
God, the new equilibrium
really does-

216
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,678
It makes the room seem tighter.

217
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,384
<i>She's always a step ahead of me.</i>

218
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,545
That's what makes her
such a worthy opponent.

219
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,318
- How'd you pay for it?
- I cashed in some stock. You knew it was unfrozen.

220
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,192
I know. I sent you that letter. It says
not to sell, or we're gonna lose control.

221
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,857
<i>It does? I stopped at "unfrozen."</i>

222
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,197
<i>Lindsay, you didn't cash in your stock,</i>
<i>did you? Tell me you didn't.</i>

223
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,203
- I didn't.
- <i>Yet.</i>

224
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,933
There's a pretty long wait list
for membership right now.

225
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,373
Gob, you didn't sell, did you?

226
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:56,073
What? No. I'm trying to get
a job from you, Mikey. Come on.

227
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,878
Okay. As long as you two didn't sell,
I think we should be okay.

228
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,214
- I was afraid that l-
- I just bought the Queen Mary.

229
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,050
<i>You're kidding.</i>
<i>I was just gonna get a yacht.</i>

230
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:08,058
No, no, no. The club. I was dancing with
what turned out to be the club's owner...

231
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,152
and he was looking to sell.

232
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,823
Oh, he really, really
did look like a woman.

233
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,232
But anyhoo, can you believe that
the only reason the club is going under...

234
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,395
is because it's
in a terrifying neighborhood?

235
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,167
- This is unbelievable.
- Tobias, I promised that money
to the country club.

236
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,732
- Country club?
- It's in such a good neighborhood.

237
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,006
I don't believe this.
Did you guys not read the letter?

238
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,413
<i>None of them</i>
<i>had read past the word "unfrozen."</i>

239
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,508
I hope you're all proud of yourselves.

240
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,986
Your careless, selfish spending sprees
may have cost us the Bluth Company.

241
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,989
Hey, Dad, is that
your new car in the driveway?

242
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,026
I can't believe you got a Corvette!

243
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,790
It's a company car.

244
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,259
<i>Michael had bought a car...</i>

245
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,600
<i>and it had helped</i>
<i>put the company in jeopardy.</i>

246
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,472
I'm sorry about the patch. I'm testifying
against the Kings this afternoon.

247
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,976
You can't see it. I just winked.

248
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,209
<i>So basically, you're</i>
<i>about 2,000 shares short...</i>

249
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,784
of being the majority stockholders.

250
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,286
<i>Now unfortunately, it's a private stock...</i>

251
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,119
<i>so you cannotjust buy up the shares</i>
<i>unless someone is willing to sell.</i>

252
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,887
- Are you sure?
- That's what they said on AskJeeves.

253
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,487
- All right, who's the majority shareholder now?
- A company called Standpoor.

254
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,694
- Standpoor?
- As in the opposite of Sitwell...

255
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,203
which is run by a certain
hairless man...

256
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,535
who could be very upset
with you right now.

257
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,836
What would he have to be upset
with me about?

258
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,811
- You're wearing his eyebrows?
- They make me feel dressier.

259
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,950
- Hello?
- Is it true, Michael? Did we lose the company?

260
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,852
Kind of. To something called
Standpoor. Yeah, it's Sitwell.

261
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,392
- It's Lucille Austero.
- Lucille 2?

262
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,020
<i>Standpoor, because she can't</i>
<i>stand up without falling over.</i>

263
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,691
I don't know why she'd have any trouble.
A piano could stand on those legs.

264
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
<i>She's trying to get even</i>
<i>with me for the remodeling.</i>

265
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,905
I think we're gonna need
a new floating thermometer.

266
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,338
Could I have your-
your Blue Cross number?

267
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,936
Well, let's think about this, Mom. I mean,
maybe there's a way that we can reason with her-

268
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,947
- Give her Buster.
- What?

269
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,177
- We need our company back.
- Mom, that's horrible.

270
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,686
I don't suppose <i>you've</i> spent money
on something <i>you</i> can return?

271
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,620
- Sweet ride, dude.
- <i>Let's give her Buster.</i>

272
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,792
Starla, do you know
where my brother is?

273
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,522
<i>Yes, he's on cloud nine.</i>
<i>That was me, Michael.</i>

274
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,757
What's going on?
Where's Starla?

275
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,232
Oh, she's saying good-bye
to someone named Q.

276
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,371
If she can get past his security system,
she's gonna tell him it's over.

277
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,133
If she can get past his security system,
she's gonna tell him it's over.

278
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,230
She's amazing.

279
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:39,141
We completely connected.
And it's all because of you.

280
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,078
You made this happen.

281
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,081
I feel alive!

282
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,311
<i>Indeed,</i>
<i>Starla and Buster did hit it off well</i>-

283
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,549
<i>Buster being a sweeter, more supportive</i>
<i>man than she was used to...</i>

284
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,387
<i>and Starla being a woman</i>
<i>that wasn't 70.</i>

285
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:59,396
<i>I'm just wondering if you</i>
<i>didn't upgrade a little too fast.</i>

286
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,901
You know, you want something sensible, you
end up getting pushed into something flashy.

287
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,766
What does that mean?

288
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,237
Don't you think
you belong in a Lucille?

289
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,071
<i>Maeby, meanwhile,</i>
<i>gave reading her script another shot...</i>

290
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,447
<i>only to discover her work was done.</i>

291
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,918
<i>Her scripts had been noted.</i>

292
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,718
<i>So she went to find the person</i>
<i>she thought was responsible.</i>

293
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,258
George Michael,
I read your notes.

294
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,420
What? You-
Oh, you found the-

295
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,828
- Well, look, I don't-That was a long-
- They were great.

296
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,869
I mean, they said so many things I wanted
to say, but I didn't know how, you know?

297
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,938
Don't tell anyone, okay?

298
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,599
Never.

299
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,338
I guess she didn't see the drawings.

300
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,883
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias prepared</i>
<i>to assume ownership of the Queen Mary.</i>

301
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,283
No, no. It's supposed to say
"Tobias's Queen Mary."

302
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,448
No, that is not what it says.
I distinct- Hello?

303
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,191
Well, I suppose I could just
paint over "Mary."

304
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,786
Don't bother, man.
This is our club now.

305
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,365
<i>Tobias didn't want to sell</i>
<i>his new club, but Lindsay did.</i>

306
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,637
<i>Which is why she hired several members</i>
<i>of a local stripper agency...</i>

307
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,542
<i>called the Hot Cops</i>
<i>to pose as the roughnecks.</i>

308
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,810
All right, fellas, look. I know you know
nothing but a life on the street...

309
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,818
but I'd like to offer you something
that the Queen Mary gave me.

310
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,854
The joy of the stage.

311
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,981
So maybe you could, uh,
start jeté-ing...

312
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,493
and stop "je-terrorizing" me.

313
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,428
- Yeah!
- Absolutely!

314
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,159
- We could do <i>Rent.</i>
- Well, this is joyous news.

315
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,259
<i>And Buster,</i>
<i>now convinced that Lucille 2...</i>

316
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>was the right woman for him,</i>
<i>broke up with Starla.</i>

317
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,442
You okay?

318
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,842
It was for the best anyway.

319
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,883
A girl like that deserves to be taken
care of, and I'm just a poor soldier.

320
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,509
You didn't sell your stock?

321
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,555
What? No. Your letter said not to...

322
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,920
and I would never
want to hurt the family.

323
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,494
<i>And Michael realized his little brother...</i>

324
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,722
<i>deserved happiness more than anyone.</i>

325
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,594
You know, uh, I want you
to forget about what I said.

326
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,600
I was wrong.
You two belong together.

327
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,761
I'll take care of Lucille 2 for you.

328
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,862
- Really?
- Yeah.

329
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,376
Let her down easy. That right knee
could go at any time.

330
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,877
Starla!

331
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,881
<i>And at the "Tobias is Queen Mary"...</i>

332
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,645
<i>Tobias couldn't believe</i>
<i>how quickly he had gotten through...</i>

333
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:38,212
<i>to his ragtag gang of neighborhood toughs.</i>

334
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:42,225
Wow. You really have made
some amazing strides in a half an hour.

335
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,386
<i>We have to take this to the streets.</i>

336
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,896
We have to strut!

337
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,058
<i>Michael knew ifhe had any chance...</i>

338
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,500
<i>of getting control of the company again...</i>

339
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,662
- <i>he would need to charm Lucille 2.</i>
- Lucille 2.

340
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,933
- Your hair!
- Can I take you for a spin?

341
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>But the spin in Michael's</i>
<i>new car retriggered her vertigo.</i>

342
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,242
<i>That night, Tobias's plan</i>
<i>to change the streets with his gang...</i>

343
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,943
<i>also turned out to be ill-conceived.</i>

344
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,283
<i>Hey, "fezellas,"looks like</i>
<i>you guys are up to no good.</i>

345
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,088
Well, this gang used to be
like that too- three, four!

346
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,095
So you think you're tough
Well, we hate rappin'

347
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,665
But don't bust a cap in
'Cause here's what's happenin'

348
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,929
<i>We're breakin'out</i>
<i>some old-fashioned tappin'</i>

349
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,971
Oh, I've been shot!

350
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,440
- We miscalculated! Retreat!
- Quick, switch to <i>Follies</i>!

351
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,875
That's not gonna help!

352
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,313
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and</i>
<i>Lucille 2 arrived to find the club nearly empty.</i>

353
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,476
<i>Although Michael</i>
<i>would have fit in perfectly.</i>

354
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,521
Something? It's probably-
I'll tell you what, Lucille.

355
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,420
- I'm gonna take you dancing, huh?
- No, Michael, please.

356
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,460
You have undone all
of Dr. Sandor Plumb's work.

357
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,964
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, the reason
that I showed up tonight...

358
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,059
was because I don't think that it's right
for you to be dating my brother.

359
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,832
I mean, he's met someone else,
and, frankly...

360
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,032
the only reason that
he asked you out tonight...

361
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,407
was because I wanted him to get
the stock back from you...

362
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,003
so that I could regain
control of the company.

363
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,515
But I would- I'd rather
have my brother back.

364
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,314
So- I'm sorry.

365
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,513
- I understand.
- Thank you.

366
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:22,185
And I do not blame you for
not liking the Bluths anymore.

367
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,092
Like the Bluths?
I love the Bluths.

368
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,997
- Why did you buy up all of our company stock?
- To support you guys.

369
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:34,835
I have always had a standing order
to buy up any available Bluth stock.

370
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,603
You do know that we're about 2,000 shares
short of controlling the company now.

371
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,873
- Well, you could have some of mine.
- Really? Would you do that?

372
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,710
- Yeah, of course.
- Well, that's-Thank you.

373
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,114
- Actually, there is a condition.
- Anything.

374
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,883
- Call me a cab.
- Ah, because of my driving. Yes.

375
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,049
<i>And so the next day...</i>

376
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,923
<i>Michael was thrilled to have</i>
<i>control of the company back.</i>

377
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,997
- I fixed everything.
- <i>Oh?</i>

378
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,089
With the business.
It's all taken care of.

379
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,796
- You didn't think I could, but I did.
- Gob, what'd you do?

380
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:10,034
Hi.
- <i>Gob had run into Lucille 2</i>
<i>after Michael dropped her off.</i>

381
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,201
My mom really took up
a bunch of your space, huh?

382
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,871
- What a bitch.
- What do you mean?

383
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,813
When she expanded her bathroom
and moved your wall over.

384
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,714
That's why all your stuff s
sticking out.

385
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,219
Oh.

386
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:28,726
Your mother really has a way of getting my goat.

387
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,795
<i>So Gob- Lucille 2.</i>

388
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,764
- You what?
- Oh, and she's not gonna give
the shares back now.

389
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,063
- You just said that you fixed everything.
- Oh, I meant <i>my</i> problems.

390
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,730
Yeah, she's gonna make me
the new president.

391
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,506
You don't need to prove
yourself to me, little brother.

392
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,410
You will always have a job here.

393
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,142
But I do need the keys
to the company car.

394
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,513
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development-

395
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,558
<i>Lucille 2 reclaims some space.</i>

396
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,462
<i>The Queen Mary</i>
<i>changes hands once again.</i>

397
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,466
L-I've wanted a small family restaurant
since I got the Kings settlement.

398
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,798
It still has the dungeon area, right?

399
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,235
<i>And Gob gets needy.</i>

400
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,569
- Oh.
- Let's go for it.

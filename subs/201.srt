00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,994
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,164
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,605
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,588
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,887
<i>Right now he's taking his son, George Michael,</i>
<i>to start a new life in Arizona.</i>

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,757
Phoenix, Arizona, huh?
This is it, boy.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,854
We are free.

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,956
We're gonna follow our dreams,
you know?

10
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,968
And the best part of it?
Not workin' for the family anymore.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,369
Yeah, but don't-
don't you always say "family first"?

12
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:45,137
Yes, I do.
But that is not a family, okay?

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,181
They're a bunch of greedy, selfish people
who have our nose.

14
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,683
- And Aunt Lindsay.
- She's not my real aunt?

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,051
Not a real nose. Got a picture of her
when she's 14 in a swimming cap.

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,124
She looks like a falcon.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,320
Spent an entire year living in that
stupid model home with those people...

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,590
and all they did was lie to us.

19
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,565
<i>The most recent lie was Michael's</i>
<i>father had had a heart attack while in prison.</i>

20
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,398
We lost him.

21
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,235
<i>What the doctor meant to say</i>
<i>was that George Sr. Had escaped...</i>

22
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,936
<i>a feat he'd accomplished by using</i>
<i>the family's portable stairway vehicle.</i>

23
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,082
I'd love to see the look on their faces
right now.

24
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,415
- "Where'd he go?"
- Or they- they think we're just headed home.

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,988
Actually, you know,
that's kind of what I thought...

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,285
until I heard about
all that Phoenix stuff.

27
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:36,089
<i>Michael was concerned</i>
<i>that the full impact ofhis departure...</i>

28
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,756
<i>might have been lost on his family.</i>

29
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,527
- Hello. Who is this?
- Yes, this is Dr. Blumen.

30
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,068
I'm calling regarding Michael Bluth.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,106
Michael! Phone!

32
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,474
They think we're still there.
We're goin' back.

33
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,548
Hey, Mom. Any messages?

34
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,173
None.

35
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,218
No, there was a message.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,288
It was about my health,
but it doesn't matter.

37
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,288
My son and l-

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,950
<i>Buster, what are you doing</i>
<i>with Mother's rape horn?</i>

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,123
<i>Yes, I have a rape horn, Michael,</i>
<i>because you took away my mace.</i>

40
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,633
Yeah, like anyone would want to "R" her.

41
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,635
This is what I'm talking about, Michael.

42
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,730
<i>Now that your father has deserted us,</i>
<i>Buster's become impossible to control.</i>

43
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,072
<i>Suddenly he's too much of a big shot</i>
<i>to brush Mother's hair.</i>

44
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,805
Well, I'm not he-

45
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,085
I'm not helping you
with Buster anymore.

46
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,882
I'm not helping anyone with anything.

47
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,856
I came here to tell you
that my son and l-

48
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,558
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was approached by his cousin Maeby.</i>

49
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,760
So, you're really leavin', huh?

50
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,565
Have you told your girlfriend, Bland?
I mean, Ann.

51
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,073
- She's not my girlfriend, and she's not bland.
- Really?

52
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,770
Because, I mean, under her school picture
it said "not pictured."

53
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,403
Okay, they printed a retraction
in the spring supplement.

54
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,745
And, yeah, she was really lookin' forward
to seeing me in my Uncle Sam outfit...

55
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,046
<i>in that Get Out The Vote</i>
<i>assembly tomorrow.</i>

56
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,178
Wasn't that supposed to be
before the election?

57
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,349
They had to postpone it when that foreign
exchange student parked too close to the gym.

58
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,551
I do it. I play Uncle Sam.

59
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,960
Better than part I have now-
guy who orders strike on Pearl Harbor.

60
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,556
<i>I don't know why you're not taking</i>
<i>this "I'm out ofhere"seriously...</i>

61
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,899
but I am out of here, seriously.

62
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,531
- Let's face it, Michael.
You've made this threat before.
- Tell me. When?

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,974
That's it. I'm out of here.

64
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,778
- Ta-da!
- I'm out of here.

65
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,014
<i>We got the attacking animal down.</i>

66
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,716
I'm out of this family, seriously.

67
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,794
This time we're gonna be so far away,
you'll never be able to find us.

68
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,159
- We're goin' to Phoenix.
- Don't tell 'em where.

69
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,289
- L-I just thought-
- It doesn't matter why.

70
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,867
Michael, maybe the reason
why you always come back...

71
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,563
is because you need us
more than we need you.

72
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,798
Oh, that's rich.

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,003
Huh. I need you.
All right, I'll tell you what.

74
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,807
<i>Mom, you're always asking me</i>
<i>to help you look after Buster.</i>

75
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,508
You can find somebody else.
I hope she doesn't kill you.

76
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,915
I'll kill her first.

77
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,682
And good luck trying to find someone else
to run the business, by the way.

78
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,257
Gob, instead of always coming to me
asking me for money...

79
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,350
saying, "I've made a huge mistake"...

80
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,486
you can bail yourself out next time.

81
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,760
I've never admitted to a mistake.
What would I have made a mistake about?

82
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,359
<i>Lindsay, instead of sleeping in twin beds,</i>
<i>you and your husband take the master bedroom.</i>

83
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,440
It's not like you've never come to me
with your marital problems...

84
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,532
saying, "Oh, help me, Michael.
I think my husband might be a"-

85
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,544
Ohh!

86
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:43,980
- Well- It's-
- Here we go.

87
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,019
<i>And so, once again, the guys were</i>
<i>on their way to Phoenix, never to look back.</i>

88
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,021
It's just the lab calling.

89
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,216
We'll give him the bad news in Phoenix.

90
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,793
- They know we're gone.
- Great.

91
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,489
You did say Phoenix again,
but what do we care?

92
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,498
Sorry.

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,560
Now, do you want to steer, or are you
too old to sit on your pop's lap and drive?

94
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,133
I think I might be.

95
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,144
Okay.

96
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,058
Car's registered to George Bluth,
so we had to check.

97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,323
- But he's been caught, so you're free to go.
- He's been caught?

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,898
<i>Michael knew</i>
<i>ifhe went back to see his father...</i>

99
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,866
<i>he would only end up</i>
<i>saying something hurtful.</i>

100
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,266
We're goin' back.

101
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,033
<i>In fact, the police only</i>
<i>thought they'd arrested George Sr.</i>

102
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,837
Do you have any cookies
with no preservatives?

103
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,606
<i>But had gotten</i>
<i>his twin brother, Oscar, instead.</i>

104
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,342
- Oscar! A tall tea for Oscar!
- Yeah!

105
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,850
Oh, good grief. It's Oscar.

106
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,853
Oh, thank God you've come.

107
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,391
<i>Lucille had a relationship</i>
<i>with Oscar years earlier...</i>

108
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,960
- <i>which she was not eager to rekindle.</i>
- What is wrong with you?

109
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,029
- The boy is here.
- Oh.

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,191
- <i>They said my father was here.</i>
- Did they?

111
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,439
- Let's get out of here.
- What-What about Oscar?

112
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,905
Yes. They impounded my, uh-
my humble trailer.

113
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,908
- You'll stay with us.
- No, he won't.

114
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,205
You're the one who says
I need a father figure.

115
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,646
Yes. A father figure.

116
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,381
Fine. But you're not sleeping
in my bed.

117
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,956
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

118
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,149
<i>Soon, Michael arrived to claim his father...</i>

119
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,162
<i>and was met by the family attorney,</i>
<i>Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

120
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,232
- Hmm.
- No, I know, I know, I know.

121
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,893
Everybody says leave it alone,
leave it alone.

122
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,732
Does this look contagious to you?
Hey, kiddo.

123
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,238
All right. It wasn't your father.

124
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,242
It was your uncle.
I ran into them as they were leaving.

125
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,437
There he is! Got ya!

126
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,674
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Yeah!

127
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,082
I only came back to tell him I was leaving,
so I guess it's time to go, Son.

128
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,984
- Where you going?
- We can't tell you.

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,751
No, no. We can tell Barry.
We're going to Phoenix.

130
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,053
Oh, I wish you hadn't have said that.

131
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,130
As your lawyer, I have to inform you
you cannot leave the state.

132
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,425
With your father gone,
they want to hold you.

133
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,763
- M-Me?
- They're going to indict you tomorrow.

134
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,463
All you have to do is come up with the bail.
Take it out of the business.

135
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,598
But l- I can't. I quit. I don't want
to follow in my father's footsteps.

136
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,802
Then you might wind up on his cot.

137
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:31,043
Oh, man, I wish you hadn't
said Phoenix. Wow.

138
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,287
<i>Michael hadjust found out</i>
<i>he couldn't leave the state...</i>

139
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,517
<i>Michael hadjust found out</i>
<i>he couldn't leave the state...</i>

140
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,522
<i>unless he came up with bail.</i>

141
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,889
Okay, listen. I'm gonna get the company
checkbook and don't tell the family.

142
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,122
We can't give them the satisfaction of
telling them that I need money, okay?

143
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,530
- Do you remember what we say about the family?
- It's not Aunt Lindsay's nose.

144
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,192
Yes, but no.

145
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,703
Don't- Don't tell them
that we were goin' to-

146
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,797
- We say we don't need them. Hmm?
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

147
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,342
The new one. I didn't-

148
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,106
<i>It comes</i>
<i>from knowing you're toned and fit.</i>

149
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,478
- What are you doing?
- I'm exercising, Michael.

150
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,848
I see you found an exercise tape
made for people as lazy as you are.

151
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,218
- I do have a love life.
- Tighten, one, two, three.

152
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,223
Okay, this is going off.

153
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,386
<i>One night in the master bedroom,</i>
<i>and you got yourself a love life again?</i>

154
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,691
Well, I'll be honest.
At first, it was awkward.

155
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,564
Together, two, three, four.

156
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,296
- <i>Release, two, three, four.</i>
- Oh, Lindsay.

157
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:30,103
Uh, well, this is exciting.

158
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,007
- Finally we can be a normal couple.
- Nice to be back in a queen.

159
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,282
- It's too much pressure.
- I can't do this.

160
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:41,342
<i>So Lindsay and Tobias finally</i>
<i>took a hard look at their relationship.</i>

161
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,948
You know, Lindsay, as a therapist,
I have advised a number of couples...

162
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,050
<i>to explore an open relationship...</i>

163
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,153
where-where the couple
remains emotionally committed...

164
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:56,065
but free to explore
extramarital encounters.

165
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,194
- Did it work for those people?
- No. It never does.

166
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,765
These people somehow delude themselves
into thinking it might, but-

167
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,346
but it might work for us.

168
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:12,042
- We could give it a shot.
- Great. We'll hammer out the details later.

169
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,915
Right now we've got a daughter to tell.

170
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,785
Maeby, we're having a family meeting!

171
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,223
<i>- On her way to the family meeting...</i>
<i>- Family meeting!</i>

172
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,261
- <i>Lindsay had an unexpected encounter.</i>
- Hello.

173
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,091
Oh, hi. Gob told me to come by.

174
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,892
Well, uh, I don't think he's here.

175
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,991
Well, tell him I like what I see.

176
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,070
And we probably won't even act on it.
We're not gonna get a divorce.

177
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,734
If anything, it'll bring
Mommy and Daddy closer together.

178
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,811
I met someone. I've got a date.

179
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,812
I'm dating someone.

180
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:48,649
Well.
Let the great experiment begin!

181
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,417
- You're not using my master bedroom for that.
- I believe you left.

182
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,652
Or did you realize
how much you need us after all?

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,354
- Actually, I came back because I need something.
- Hmm.

184
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,422
Some things. Like the checkbook.
Where's the corporate checkbook?

185
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,764
Gob must've taken it to the office.

186
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,930
<i>Mom put him in charge.</i>
<i>That's right, Michael. He's got your oldjob.</i>

187
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,498
Well, I better get over there before
he brings the whole company down.

188
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,637
It's only been three hours.
How much damage could he really do?

189
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,647
And release.

190
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:21,618
<i>In three hours,</i>
<i>Gob had done $45,000 in damage.</i>

191
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,689
In there, please.

192
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,120
Hey, where's my desk?

193
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,287
Oh, I think it's the massage table
in the break room now.

194
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,162
- Take the window.
- No, hold it.

195
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,530
Gob, Mom may think
that she's given you my job...

196
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,831
but the board still has to
approve that decision.

197
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,203
- Actually, they already have.
- Why should we believe in you?

198
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,243
For the same reason you should
believe that a hundred-dollar bill...

199
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,507
is no more than a hundred pennies.

200
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,309
<i>They approved me unanimously.</i>

201
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,582
Why wouldn't they?
You've only lost them $99 so far.

202
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,748
I've already been pretty successful.

203
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,986
Showing the model house again.
Sent a Realtor over there yesterday.

204
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,689
<i>It was this Realtor who'd run into</i>
<i>Lindsay, thinking she was looking for a home.</i>

205
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,666
I have an open thing goin' on too.
I'll give you the address, and you can come by.

206
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,738
<i>And I think you'll really</i>
<i>like the neighbors.</i>

207
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,669
Okay.

208
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,868
So what brings you here?
I hope it's not for a handout.

209
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,343
I run a pretty tight ship around here.

210
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,108
- With a pool table?
- It's a gaming ship.

211
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:27,083
<i>I'm here because</i>
<i>I thought you might need me.</i>

212
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,381
- I need you?
- That's right.

213
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,923
Oh, boy, that's good.

214
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,893
Can't wait to call the guys in
to hear this one.

215
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,521
Listen-
How do you intercom on this?

216
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,623
- Star two.
- Yeah. At the same time?

217
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,702
Yeah, just-
No, the star in the corner. The star.

218
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,271
- So if I do it like that-
- No, turn it around the other way. Star.

219
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,840
- Oh, that star.
- Let's just hang it up. There we go.

220
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,138
L-I thought that you might need me
to help you with the books.

221
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,111
You know, the corporate checkbook.
Where is it?

222
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,843
Actually, Mom's got it.
She wasn't comfortable with me-

223
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,419
<i>Michael now had the distasteful choice...</i>

224
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,148
<i>of either asking his mother for money</i>
<i>or going tojail.</i>

225
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,054
Maybe Buster killed her already.

226
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,627
<i>Tobias was also having a bad day.</i>

227
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,130
<i>Lindsay had met someone,</i>
<i>and he hadn't.</i>

228
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,498
<i>And that's when he found what he thought</i>
<i>was a support group for depressed men.</i>

229
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,967
Well, if it isn't the boy
who cried "Phoenix."

230
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,069
Ohh! No, I was just, uh-
just worried about Buster.

231
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,082
<i>I thought maybe I should</i>
<i>give him a little guidance.</i>

232
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,244
Write him a check. Be a role model.
Where's the company checkbook?

233
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,822
I already have a new role model,
Michael.

234
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,791
- His Uncle Oscar is living here now.
- Wow.

235
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,692
You guys have accomplished a lot
in the last three hours.

236
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,698
- Where is he?
- I sent him out for a new air horn.

237
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,439
Yeah!

238
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,874
- We've got it all under control.
- Great.

239
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,474
I'm just worried that it's
only gonna be a matter of time...

240
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,110
before the media starts putting together
all the pieces of this Iraq story.

241
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,882
<i>Michael had recently</i>
<i>found out that the model home...</i>

242
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,550
<i>he and his son currently lived in...</i>

243
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:18,460
<i>was very similar to some his father</i>
<i>may have illegally been building in Iraq.</i>

244
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:23,194
They haven't yet. And frankly,
it's a very difficult charge to prove.

245
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,968
Man, that jury's gonna
fall in love with you.

246
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:36,571
- What do you need, Michael?
- I don't need anything.

247
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,651
I'm great,
'cause everyone else is great.

248
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:43,745
I can't tell you how nice it is
to not be needed anymore.

249
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,416
<i>I want you.</i>

250
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:52,054
Okay, the jury might actually like that.

251
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,260
<i>It was at that moment that Gob</i>
<i>found something thejury might not like.</i>

252
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,531
Hammer. Oops.

253
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,949
<i>And Lindsay arrived</i>
<i>at what she thought was a date.</i>

254
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,951
<i>Hey! You found it.</i>

255
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,544
So, shall we start in the kitchen?

256
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,351
- I thought the bedroom.
- Sure.

257
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,393
I'll meet you up there.
I gotta make this place smell like cookies.

258
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,897
And you should know,
I am anticipating multiples on this.

259
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,696
Well, I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think that was a possibility.

260
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,735
<i>Lindsay was nervous</i>
<i>and took a shower to relax.</i>

261
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,280
I can't do this. I'm not ready for this.

262
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,780
<i>Come on, kids. We'll go downstairs</i>
<i>and have some cookies.</i>

263
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,081
<i>The kids were in for some bad news too.</i>

264
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,919
<i>Tobias, meanwhile, discovered that</i>
<i>what he thought was a support group...</i>

265
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,153
<i>turned out to be a team</i>
<i>ofbald men painted blue.</i>

266
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,357
<i>Even Lucille was about</i>
<i>to find herself in trouble.</i>

267
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,559
Oh, you've done this before.

268
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,136
You know, you should let
your hair grow long.

269
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,434
Yeah? I've thought about it.
I guess I'd look like you.

270
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,566
More than you'll ever know.

271
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,711
Are you living in one
of Saddam's many palaces?

272
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,283
They may have been built
by the same developer.

273
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,515
<i>And a seal attack.</i>
<i>Meet one surprised bather, coming up.</i>

274
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,260
<i>Seven minutes had passed</i>
<i>since Gob had discovered the document.</i>

275
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,126
Gob, your mother on line one.

276
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,097
I'm coming over.
Don't talk to anyone.

277
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,694
<i>It was at that moment that Lucille</i>
<i>was stopped by a documentary filmmaker.</i>

278
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:45,072
Uh, your company's being accused of
profiting off the building of houses in Iraq.

279
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,611
That's crazy.
We're all loyal Americans.

280
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,240
Oh, yeah. Would you enlist
your son or daughter in the army?

281
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,454
Yes.

282
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,616
<i>Michael was out of options...</i>

283
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:07,131
<i>and, knowing that his father had a penchant</i>
<i>for hiding valuable things in walls...</i>

284
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,395
<i>considered one last desperate gambit.</i>

285
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,302
This is crazy. What am I doing?
Using a hammer to try to-

286
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,838
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blue?

287
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,348
Only in color, Michael.
Only in color.

288
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,318
It seems I might have stumbled
upon an acting opportunity.

289
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,650
As a member of the Blue Man Group?

290
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,656
Oh, no, you're thinking
of the support group.

291
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,489
I made that same mistake myself.
They're called the Blue Man Group.

292
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,359
But it's funny. If I hadn't
sought out a support group...

293
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:44,198
I never would've gotten this gig
as an understudy for a performance art group.

294
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,940
You know, the universe works
in mysterious ways, Michael.

295
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,501
You never know where help is going
to come from until you look for it.

296
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,672
Why does everybody think
that I need help?

297
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,751
Michael, look at you.

298
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,221
I mean, you're holding a sledgehammer,
your shirt is cov- Oh, I did that.

299
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,724
Um, here, let me, uh-Well-

300
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,886
<i>And Michael realized</i>
<i>that he, too, had been too proud.</i>

301
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,362
- I need money.
- I can't help you.

302
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,993
I know. It did bother me
that they did so well without me.

303
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,401
But l-I do have to ask them for help.

304
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,770
And I have to ask for an audition.

305
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,241
You haven't auditioned yet?

306
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,676
Oh, no, no.
I'm not in the group yet.

307
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,874
No, I'm afraid I just "blue" myself.

308
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,115
There's gotta be
a better way to say that.

309
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,089
<i>Tobias rushed to the theater,</i>
<i>hoping to be seen.</i>

310
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,455
<i>Unfortunately, it was dusk,</i>
<i>and he couldn't be seen.</i>

311
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,825
What the hell was that?

312
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,230
<i>So, for the second time in two days,</i>
<i>the family gathered at the hospital.</i>

313
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,894
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

314
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,735
I'm so sorry that this happened.
I spoke to him just before he left the house.

315
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,572
- Oh, really? What was the last thing he said?
- I just "blue" myself.

316
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,444
He said some wonderful things...

317
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,916
including the fact
that sometimes people...

318
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,749
are too proud to ask for help
when they need it.

319
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,985
- Oh, God! Fine. I need you!
- I need you, okay, Michael?
- No, l-I didn't mean for-

320
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,857
He was a Realtor, Michael.
Now my husband's in the hospital.

321
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:21,990
Mom volunteered me for the army
just because the fat man dared her to.

322
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,265
- We can't let them take Buster.
- I lost my wig, my Uncle Sam wig.

323
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,363
<i>Michael, I am sitting on</i>
<i>some very hot information here.</i>

324
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,535
I know too much.
I've got the thingy.

325
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,670
Half in English, half in scribbly.

326
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,012
Michael, please, we need you!

327
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,248
Well, I hate to cancel
my medical follow-up in Phoenix...

328
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,347
but you give me the corporate checkbook,
I'll see what I can do.

329
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,688
Excuse me. Mrs. Fünke.

330
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,854
- Oh, this guy again.
- How is he, Doctor?

331
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,330
It, uh, looks like he's dead.

332
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,731
- Oh, my God!
<i>- Oh, little guy!</i>

333
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,271
- The tears aren't coming!
The tears just aren't coming!
- Okay, okay.

334
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,465
<i>Uh, just to be clear</i>-

335
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,008
Looks like he's dead, or he is dead?

336
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,078
It just looks like he's dead.

337
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,012
He's got, like, blue paint on him
or something, but he's going to be fine.

338
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,583
- What is wrong with you?
- What a- doctor!

339
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,848
- I'll let you celebrate privately.
- Hey, we want this comped!

340
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,423
Well, I'm gonna-
I'm just gonna head out.

341
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,484
You don't need some, uh, piece of-
uncle hanging around.

342
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,723
Hey, hey! That's not my dad. That's not the guy
you want. If you want anybody, it's me.

343
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,493
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Michael?</i>

344
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,228
<i>Yeah. I gotta turn myself in</i>
<i>or make bail...</i>

345
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,304
uh, maybe by, like, 8:00.

346
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,669
Hey, hey, hey. That's enough.

347
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,902
Whoa, hey. You might want
to have that looked at.

348
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,174
Thanks, Mikey.

349
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,079
They think I'm involved
in this Iraq thing...

350
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,653
and I can't prove that I'm not
with Dad not around...

351
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,450
so I need your help
or I'm gonna go to jail.

352
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:56,392
We've got the proof, Michael.
Dad signed a contract with Saddam.

353
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,697
Hussein.

354
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,028
Use it.

355
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,866
<i>If it makes your father look bad,</i>
<i>then so be it. He's long gone now.</i>

356
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,703
- Hey, uh, where's the briefcase?
- Oscar has it.

357
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,243
Hey, I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

358
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,906
I got here as fast as l-
Oh, how is he?

359
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,983
Did you just change your clothes?

360
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,712
Hey, look what I found on windowsill.

361
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,220
<i>Just hat. Someone take wig.</i>

362
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,759
<i>In fact, it was George Sr. Who took wig...</i>

363
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,623
- Hit it!
- <i>and was fleeing the country with the evidence...</i>

364
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,754
<i>Michael so badly needed.</i>

365
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,834
You made a huge mistake.

366
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

367
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:46,172
- <i>Lindsay almost stumbles</i>
<i>upon a dating opportunity.</i>
- You look really hot.

368
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:51,238
<i>But instead, is admitted to the hospital</i>
<i>with a fever of 104.</i>

369
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,346
<i>Michael finally gets</i>
<i>the corporate checkbook...</i>

370
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,254
<i>only to find that the family</i>
<i>has gotten to it first.</i>

371
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,418
<i>And Barry lands in jail.</i>

372
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,586
You're glad Tobias is pressing charges?

373
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,188
I am having the time of my life.

374
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,564
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, Dr. Hate.

375
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,637
<i>No touching!</i>

1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:05,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,610
<i>Michael had received a witness list...</i>

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,621
<i>for his father's upcoming trial.</i>

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,691
Who's on the list?
Any blabbers?

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,851
They've got one guy
who won't be talking.

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,452
That is, unless,
there's a hand inside of him.

10
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,293
- Please, Michael. Even then, I wouldn't
say anything. - That's reassuring.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,925
- But I was referring to Gob's puppet Franklin.
- Yes!

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,527
- I got him in the system.
- You did this on purpose?

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:42,404
Oh, yeah. He is re-dyed, rested,
and ready to work.

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,205
Oughta be a good way to get some press.
Oh, I gotta tell Franklin.

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,041
- I think he meant "get Franklin."
- Am I on the list?

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,616
- We all are.
<i>- Franklin, guess what.</i>

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,878
- But I don't know anything.
- He hasn't heard anything from me.

18
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,921
- I don't know anything.
- You both certainly act innocent.

19
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,990
<i>Buster knew a great deal...</i>

20
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,889
<i>for Lucille almost nightly
got drunk and told him.</i>

21
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:05,192
Your father says he wants me
to go all the way to Fallujah.

22
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,734
I thought he meant the sex act
that's so popular with your generation.

23
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,565
I know you're awake. Faker!

24
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,074
More significantly, they've put
an N. Bluth on the witness list.

25
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,805
I hope that doesn't stand for what I think
it stands for. Whoa! I did not say that.

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,813
You did, Gob.
Your mouth moved. Your hand didn't.

27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,247
Oh. Well, I should work on that.

28
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,978
Is there an N. Bluth in the family
that we don't know about?

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,250
They say there's been money found
in an account under that name.

30
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,824
Of course not.
The prosecution is trying to test us...

31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,326
see if we're gonna
turn against each other.

32
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:39,091
They make stuff up.
She doesn't exist.

33
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,429
Uh, yet, you refer to her as a "she."

34
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,469
- He, she... What's the difference?
- Hear! Hear!

35
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,506
In the dark, it all looks the same.

36
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,303
They're probably just taking
a shot in the darkness.

37
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,311
But the good news is that
Jan Eagleman called...

38
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,280
and she is willing
to consider our case.

39
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,283
- Jan Eagleman?
- She's from the Justice TV.

40
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,615
Not another media whore.

41
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,656
You know, frankly, I think I can
put together a pretty good defense.

42
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,782
Oh, no.
He thinks he's a lawyer again.

43
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,554
<i>Devotees will remember that Michael...</i>

44
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,789
<i>once played a lawyer
in a school play.</i>

45
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,632
You know, just because
you played a role doesn't make it real.

46
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,571
Of course, Buster did grow up
to be Captain Hook.

47
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:25,303
- Not cool, Mom.
- Oh, please. You'd be a lousy attorney.

48
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,107
The first piece of evidence against us,
you'd run for the hills.

49
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,546
No, Jan is interested.
She carries a lot of weight...

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,016
and she is not
charging us anything.

51
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,019
Like to see a whore that does that!

52
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,385
Not the "carrying the weight" part.

53
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,390
But, on the other hand,
if it's free...

54
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,485
She wants us to do a mock trial.
Sort of a dry run just to get us ready.

55
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,861
I guess we could all use some experience
in the courtroom. I'll go check her out.

56
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,197
But I'll tell you all right now,
no one is going to lie on that stand.

57
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,329
And no one is gonna
betray the family.

58
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,101
<i>Buster was nervous.</i>

59
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,406
<i>That's what all the rocking
and humming was about.</i>

60
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,606
<i>And Michael met with
Justice TV's Jan Eagleman...</i>

61
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,741
<i>who was currently doing
a tech rehearsal.</i>

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,343
We're doing a tech rehearsal
for my new <i>show... Judge Reinhold.</i>

63
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,389
- It's a reality courtroom show. - You know
that there's an actor by that name, right?

64
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,584
This is what they put me in.
Why did I lose all the weight...

65
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,593
if they're gonna
put me in a pool cover?

66
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,631
- I'm sorry. Are you an actual judge?
- No. That's just a coincidence.

67
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,964
I read somewhere Judge Judy
made $25 million last year.

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,903
I'm, like, hey,
I never even heard of the guy.

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,100
So you just... You're doin' this
because your name is Judge?

70
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,872
Honestly, this is the first time
I put those two things together.

71
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,106
Maybe we should take "Judge"
out of the title...

72
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,877
and go with my original title:
<i>Mr. Reinhold's Courtroom.</i>

73
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,612
No, no, no.
We're changin' the name.

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,915
Thanks, Michael.

75
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,583
I've got 250,000 talking magazine ads,
and he wants to change the name.

76
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,661
<i>My name is Judge.</i>

77
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,661
- Hear you wanna do a mock trial.
- Mmm.

78
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,560
- Yeah?
- And we can do it here on the set.

79
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,327
'Cause I'm looking for Judge Reinhold
to have a little practice too.

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,403
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be acting as the prosecutor.

81
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,630
That way, I can see
how your family holds up.

82
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,731
Families that do well are
the ones that stick together.

83
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,110
Well, that's-that's us.

84
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,477
Um, we are going to need a defense
attorney, right, for the mock trial?

85
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,745
- And that's not gonna be cheap.
- You know the case. Why not you?

86
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,919
Yes. Yeah, give me a chance
to show my dad what I can do.

87
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,755
I'll-I'll-I'll show him.
I'll make a fool out of him...

88
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,489
while sticking together.

89
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,760
- Excuse me one minute.
<i>- And that's when Michael found out...</i>

90
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,994
<i>his brother Buster was in a coma.</i>

91
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,367
- What happened? How is he?
- We're waiting for the doctor.

92
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,636
I just pray it's one of those things where
he's unconscious throughout the entire trial...

93
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,270
and when it's over he wakes up
and gets a big toy.

94
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,610
Wait a minute.
Are you responsible for this, Mom?

95
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,014
Did you put one of your sons
into a coma so that he can't testify?

96
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:51,648
Michael, how dare you! Of course,
it crossed my mind, but this was all Buster.

97
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,250
- He got into your brother's pills.
- Not the Forget-Me-Nows?

98
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,228
He asked me for them. I didn't know.
I thought he was dating again.

99
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,459
Hope you don't mind me saying,
but these things can go on indefinitely.

100
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,161
My mother's been in that bed
for two years.

101
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,535
Oh, how awful!
We don't have a private room.

102
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,404
They won't let me take out
her feeding tube. And I'm lucky.

103
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,637
I have the resources to pay
for these medical bills.

104
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,679
You have resources?

105
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,579
- What good is my money if I can't bring her back?
- But you can't.

106
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,983
Money should be spent on dating.
Is that what you were gonna say?

107
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,318
- Let's go ahead and wait outside.
- So, you come here often?

108
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,585
Cute button.

109
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,423
- How is he?
- We're still waitin' to find out.

110
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,157
I got here as soon as I could.
Oh, the red tape.

111
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:36,031
- Looks a little bit more like Red Prawn, Dad.
- It's the shrimp fest.

112
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,659
Oh, the shrimp.

113
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,898
Do you realize Buster's probably
in this state because of you and Mom?

114
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,340
He's obviously afraid of what he knows,
and he's just trying to forget.

115
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,344
Does he know who N. Bluth is?

116
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,006
Right now, he doesn't know
who B. Bluth is.

117
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,243
I'm gonna need some real answers outta you,
because I've just discussed it with Jan.

118
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,252
I am going to be pretending
to be your attorney...

119
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,448
at the mock trial
before Judge Reinhold.

120
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,424
You're the lawyer? That's the same
representation Captain Hook had.

121
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,586
It's so good to laugh again.

122
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,596
- Oh, it feels good.
- It does.

123
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,791
They say seven minutes
heals all wounds.

124
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,961
Wait. Not the <i>Judge Reinhold</i> show
from all those magazine ads?

125
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:16,474
- They're all over the place. Look at this.
<i>- My name is Judge.</i>

126
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,601
I didn't even know that
this kind of technology existed.

127
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,202
I could use this
in my ventriloquism act.

128
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,942
There a bar here?

129
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,486
Well, Buster's in what we call
a light-to-no coma.

130
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,455
In layman's terms, it might be
considered a very heavy nap.

131
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,082
- Could that mean that he's faking it?
- Highly likely this is fake.

132
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,627
Although, there doesn't seem
to be very much brain activity.

133
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,392
- No. That's him. - I think it's very
important we remember he's fully insured.

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,230
- I say we see how this plays out.
- Absolutely.

135
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,236
We're gonna be here every day.

136
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,741
I don't care if it takes from now
till the end of shrimp fest.

137
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,437
If this young man gets bored, we need
a lot of volunteers here at the hospital.

138
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,605
Turning over the bedridden,
changing bedpans.

139
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,343
- Or there's a mall across the street.
- Oh, you want excitement?

140
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,351
Well, we have a group
of young people...

141
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,944
who put on fake weddings
for our Alzheimer's patients.

142
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,422
It actually would probably look pretty good
on some college applications.

143
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,120
- Would I have to touch the old people?
- Only their hearts.

144
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,095
You could be a groom.
Bring a little girlfriend up there with you.

145
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,928
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Sister then, or a cousin.

146
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,525
Of course,
you're gonna have to kiss.

147
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,605
<i>Guess who liked that idea?</i>

148
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,106
He says he doesn't wanna do it. I'm actually
trying to respect his choices lately.

149
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,144
Great. I was just...
Well, don't answer for... I, um...

150
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,978
Yeah, 'cause I know exactly the cousin.
I mean, the girl.

151
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,983
I would want to give,
and she'll wanna give too.

152
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,452
And we'll do that together for them,
for the sake of...

153
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,956
It's a great day...

154
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,552
for being sad.

155
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,860
<i>And later,
Michael was preparing for his case.</i>

156
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,298
So I've got a date with the guy
with the brain-dead mom.

157
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,894
I mean, it's just a picket for them
to pull the plug on our loved ones.

158
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,496
Given up hope on Buster
pretty quickly there, Lindsay.

159
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,543
Listen, I know Buster.
I know what he wants.

160
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,339
Oh, I love soup.

161
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,745
If the only thing I could do was lay in bed
all day and eat soup, I'd be happy.

162
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,978
I wouldn't even have to taste it.
I could just take it through a tube.

163
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,112
That would actually be better,
'cause I wouldn't even burn my mouth.

164
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,884
Never let me die.

165
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,396
Yeah, he wants out. Anyway, you and I
both know he's probably just faking.

166
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,398
- Busy?
- Actually, I'm...

167
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,661
Check this out. My lips don't move.
You'll call me up to the stand.

168
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,134
Say something like,
"Who is this little friend?" And he'll say:

169
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,536
<i>- My name is Judge.</i>
- Whose name is Judge?

170
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,938
<i>- My name is...</i> - Okay.
- That's a silly name.

171
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,772
- That's enough.
<i>- Judge. My name...</i>

172
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,609
- Yes, I am judging your name. It am silly.
<i>- Is...</i>

173
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,910
- Please stop.
- Now you're correcting my grammar?

174
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,009
Gob, not gonna put Franklin on the stand.
And your lips are moving just a little bit.

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,520
- Judge.
- He's right. His name is Judge now.

176
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,057
You know, I think Dad
might actually have a case here.

177
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,558
I mean, I am concerned
about this N. Bluth.

178
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,654
But if it is indeed just a ploy on their part,
then the only bombshell they've got...

179
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,326
is a blueprint
of an Iraqi model home...

180
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,233
the same blueprint as ours
with no record...

181
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,238
that we actually got paid for it.

182
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,276
Although, this is strange. Looks like there's
a secret room in this one off the hallway.

183
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,471
I wonder if we've got that.
I'm gonna go check that out.

184
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,539
- Okay, and we're gonna go back to the hospital.
- Yeah, good. Check on Buster.

185
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,812
We do need to stick together
as a family on this.

186
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,913
Actually, gonna go swipe some more talking
magazines, but I'll make sure to poke the head in.

187
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,322
Bye.

188
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,332
<i>And Michael found that
there was indeed a secret room...</i>

189
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:32,530
<i>where his father had stored the family
mementoes, including his birth certificate.</i>

190
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,572
<i>"Nichael Bluth"?</i>

191
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,068
Am I N. Bluth?

192
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:43,240
Is he trying to set me up?
If I'm N. Bluth, I'm going to prison.

193
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,647
<i>Nichael was worried.</i>

194
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,388
<i>Michael had just discovered
a hidden room in the model home...</i>

195
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,983
<i>where all the family secrets
were stored.</i>

196
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:01,499
My dad's trying to pin all of his crimes
on N. Bluth, and I might be N. Bluth.

197
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,626
- Huh. - That's what it says
according to my birth certificate.

198
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,204
- All of our family records are up here.
- Hmm.

199
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,298
And for some reason, this stack
of bodybuilding magazines.

200
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,936
Well, I guess your dad must've
had these from way back when, huh?

201
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,173
<i>- My name is...</i>
- That seems kind of current.

202
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,443
Oh! Who am I trying to kid, Michael?

203
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,746
I was trying to beef up
to impress that wife of mine.

204
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,321
But now she's after some rich guy
who's trying to kill his mom.

205
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,152
I gotta go talk to my dad.
You comin' out?

206
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,283
No. No, I have
to fight for my wife.

207
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,225
I'm gonna keep my marriage alive.

208
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,860
<i>One room over, George Michael...</i>

209
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,459
<i>was also trying to convince someone
to pursue a fake marriage.</i>

210
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,132
We'd have to kiss. Wouldn't that be kind
of weird after what we've been through?

211
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,141
Well, that was a long time ago.

212
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,677
<i>It had been two months since they'd kissed.</i>

213
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,373
Well, it does sound like
a good twist on a wedding film.

214
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,645
- A-A film? - Without the corny
"runaway bride" bit in the middle.

215
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,243
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- And so, like many people...</i>

216
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,415
<i>who no longer felt anything for
each other, they decided to get married.</i>

217
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,983
I'm N. Bluth, aren't I?
Legally, that's my real name.

218
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,656
You've been doing all the Iraq business
under it thinking it wouldn't be traceable.

219
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,634
- But it is, and I'm going down.
- For God's sakes, it's a typo, Michael.

220
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,933
What kind of father do you think I am?
They even got your birth date wrong.

221
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,601
- That is my birthday.
- It's close to Christmas. Was that hard?

222
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,704
It's a coincidence, Michael.
You're not N. Bluth. There is no N. Bluth.

223
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,273
I called Jan Eagleman about this,
and she says it sounds pretty bad.

224
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,684
- You called her? She's with the prosecution.
- Just for the mock trial.

225
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,189
Yeah, but what if she wasn't?

226
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,454
I am glad we're having this mock trial,
because it has shown me...

227
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,621
that you cannot be involved
in the real defense.

228
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,631
- Oh, come on.
- Why can't you be like Buster?

229
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:45,966
He put himself in a coma
to protect this family, poor kid.

230
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,632
- I gotta get down there now.
- Shrimp fest is over, Pop.

231
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,199
Really?
Better go to Chili's.

232
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,441
<i>Back at the hospital,
Lindsay had joined Brian in protest.</i>

233
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,040
All they're doing in there
is trying to keep people alive.

234
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,881
- It's a life mill.
- Oh, hello, Lindsay.

235
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,081
I'd like to introduce you to a friend
of mine that I met at the gym.

236
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:10,292
- Hi. I'm Father Ben. - Ben is a Franciscan
who can bench-press over 200 pounds.

237
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,264
And he talked me into protesting too.
Show 'em your sign.

238
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,335
No, the other side, 'cause that...

239
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,463
Tobias, Brian and I believe in
the dignity of every human being.

240
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,839
Now, why don't we leave the fruits with
the vegetables and go get a coffee?

241
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,844
Do some pushups.

242
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,471
<i>George Michael and Maeby
were also at the hospital...</i>

243
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,177
<i>putting on a wedding
for the Alzheimer's patients.</i>

244
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,584
And now, they are truly family.
It is permanent...

245
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,919
eternal.

246
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,788
<i>And Maeby did the thing
she had always thought was so corny...</i>

247
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,362
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

248
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,431
- But we're not...
- What am I doing?

249
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,523
<i>And ran away.</i>

250
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,534
What are we gonna do?

251
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,332
Just give it a minute.

252
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,036
Now it's a bar mitzvah.

253
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,273
<i>And as George Michael
acted like a boy becoming a man...</i>

254
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,782
<i>Michael returned to his office
to find a man acting like a boy.</i>

255
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,343
- What's this?
- Just practicing my testimony. Fake witness box.

256
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,856
And you couldn't have just taken my stuff
off the desk first or unplugged my computer?

257
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,359
Justice is swift, Michael. Plus,
we need to be prepared for our testimony.

258
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,626
You're not doing any of that
"My name is Judge" stuff on the stand, okay?

259
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,896
No. They're all out of magazines at
the hospital. Besides, I've got a better idea.

260
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,903
<i>Which he got at the hospital.</i>

261
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:30,704
Patient presented with gastric bacterial
infection coupled with peptic ulcers.

262
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,472
Tetracycline should not be
administered due to allergies.

263
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,843
Check this out. You'll say,
"Who's this little friend?"

264
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,439
And I'll say,
"Well, he's not really feeling that well."

265
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,519
And you'll say,
"Oh, what's wrong with the little guy?"

266
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,712
And he'll say...

267
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,484
<i>Patient presented with
gastric bacterial infection.</i>

268
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,994
Wow. Sounds like you
could use some try-cycling.

269
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,188
<i>Tetracycline should not be
administered due to allergies.</i>

270
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,564
Your lips are still moving, and...
You stole the doctor's tape recorder?

271
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,330
- Just the tape.
- I'm giving it back to him.

272
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,496
- Come on, Michael! - Gob...
- I need this!

273
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,166
My career needs this.
You know what? Dad was right.

274
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,108
If you really cared about this family,
you'd be more supportive of me in this.

275
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,012
Gob, I'm not gonna turn
this mock trial into some kind of...

276
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,346
- You were gonna say mockery.
- I was in trouble, like, three words into that.

277
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,579
<i>So Michael went back to the hospital...</i>

278
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,851
<i>when he had a visit
from the real prosecutor.</i>

279
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,688
Wayne, what are you doin' here?

280
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,194
- We heard about the trial. We wanna
make a deal with you. - A deal?

281
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,526
- It's a mock trial.
- Read the Patriot Act.

282
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,499
Anything said in a mock trial
or daytime courtroom show...

283
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,129
can be used in any real criminal proceeding
or prime-time procedural show...

284
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,697
subject to the interpretation of the
presiding judge or the executive producer.

285
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,800
In our case, Judge Reinhold is both.

286
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,378
- Did he get EP?
- Sure did.

287
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,777
Good for him.
Anyway, put your dad on the stand...

288
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,907
get him talking,
and you get full immunity.

289
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,145
If you don't do it, we're gonna go after
N. Bluth, and we think that's you.

290
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,587
You're asking me to conspire against my own
client. Couldn't you go to jail for that?

291
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,491
- Think about it, Michael. It may be time to
cut and run. - We don't do that in my family.

292
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,065
<i>Maeby had just
run away from a fake wedding...</i>

293
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,867
<i>that had gotten a little too real.</i>

294
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,637
- You know about this room too?
- Yeah, it's my dad's exercise room.

295
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,213
<i>Although, for all her worldliness...</i>

296
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,714
<i>Maeby was still
a child in many ways.</i>

297
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,717
Yeah, I-I come here to think myself
sometimes. But I always knock first.

298
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,686
I-I always do that. I always do that
anyway, no matter what room.

299
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,758
- So what happened back there?
- I don't know.

300
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,020
I guess I just got
a little weirded out.

301
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,756
I mean, we're cousins.
It's wrong.

302
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,798
Well, you know, the Torah tells us
that the larger wrong...

303
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,390
is to put our own feelings
before the commitments we've made.

304
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,402
You know, towards the sick,
aged and gross.

305
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,836
<i>- That's not in the Torah.</i>
- And, I mean, you know...

306
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,931
we weren't there
for ourselves today.

307
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,636
We were there
to bring happiness to others.

308
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:51,410
And I just... I just feel now like we left
a lot of old people sad there today.

309
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,417
<i>Again, not true.</i>

310
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,551
I mean, you know,
I'm not saying it's not weird for me too.

311
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,324
I'm saying maybe we could take those weird
feelings and turn them into something positive.

312
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>He really wanted that kiss.</i>

313
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,196
I mean, I guess it would be
a good way to freak out our parents.

314
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,601
Let's freak them out.

315
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,697
Hey, you guys know
about this room too, huh?

316
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,767
I'm just lookin' for some evidence for
my trial against Pop-Pop... for Pop-Pop.

317
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,115
I mean, seriously, Doctor,
when are we gonna know something?

318
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,243
- I'm tryin' to get on with my life.
- So is what remains of Buster.

319
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,549
Dr. Farmer,
there's a problem in 302.

320
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,920
The patient's having a bad reaction
to the tetracycline.

321
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,892
Tetracycline?
Didn't I say not to give him that?

322
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,895
Didn't you listen to my notes?

323
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,796
I'm trying to get on with my life,
and you know what? You can't deal with it.

324
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,099
- No, I can't, Lindsay.
- You're not interested in me.

325
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,176
- And you're not capable of intimacy.
- Well, just fake it!

326
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,478
Coma.

327
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,276
<i>And, believe it or not,
that actually got through to them.</i>

328
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,747
Now, will you please turn on the Cartoon
Network and get the hell out of here?

329
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,755
<i>And the next day...</i>

330
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,724
<i>the mock trial began,
as did the mock episode...</i>

331
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,817
<i>of what had
now been renamed...</i>

332
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,828
- Mock Trial with J. Reinhold.
<i>- Mock Trial with J. Reinhold.</i>

333
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,331
Take one.
In five, four, three...

334
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:30,340
All rise for acting's highest honor,
Judge Reinhold!

335
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,885
Judge Reinhold is neither a real judge,
nor has he received acting's highest honor.

336
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,851
Wow. Thank you.

337
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,357
That's the first time I ever got
a standing ovation before the show.

338
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,492
- They're not clapping.
- They don't in a courtroom.

339
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,031
Please be seated.f

340
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,192
<i>The proceedings got under way...</i>

341
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,295
<i>and the Bluths set about pretending
they were a family that stays together.</i>

342
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,636
<i>You never heard anyone
in your family discuss plans...</i>

343
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,939
to either travel to Iraq
or do business there?

344
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,709
Well, I spend so much time
making sweet love on my wife...

345
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,753
that it's hard to hear anything
over the clatter of her breasts and...

346
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,985
- Your witness.
- I have nothing.

347
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,759
Oh, how should I know
where the money comes from?

348
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:21,163
I just know where it goes...
to taking care of my poor comatose son.

349
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,099
And if this were the real trial,
I'd cry here.

350
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,331
I'm saving my good stuff too.

351
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,603
- I have no cross at this time.
- This is why you're not handling my real defense.

352
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,610
I have one witness, Dad,
and he'll clear everything up.

353
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,272
<i>- Gob had a little trouble.</i>
- State your name.

354
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,349
<i>My name is Judge.</i>

355
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,181
What kind of name is that, magazine?

356
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,120
I'm just gonna go ahead and jump
in right here. I have nothing for him.

357
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,255
<i>But now, it was Michael's turn.</i>

358
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,261
Listen, have fun out there,
because this is the last time...

359
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,094
you're gonna see this side of a courtroom till
your second wife divorces your freckled ass.

360
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,361
Look at that.
You just blew your wedding speech.

361
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,632
I'd like to jump right ahead
to calling a surprise witness.

362
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,867
- Only witnesses on the list.
- Oh, he's on the list.

363
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,639
I would like to call to the stand...

364
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,045
Franklin Delano Bluth.

365
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,778
- You're callin' Franklin, Mikey?
- I sure am, pal.

366
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,719
I support my brother.

367
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,890
Your Honor, this is highly unusual.

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,060
Well, I'm very curious to see
where this is going. I'm gonna allow it.

369
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,606
But I'm warning you, Mr. Bluth,
this better make for a good promo.

370
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,937
I was approached by
the real prosecution recently...

371
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,343
and was asked if I would be willing
to turn on my family and save myself.

372
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,779
Would you please
press the play button...

373
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,750
on the tape recorder
inside the puppet?

374
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,879
<i>If you don't do it, we're gonna go
after N. Bluth, and we think that's you.</i>

375
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,924
<i>You're asking me to conspire
against my own client.</i>

376
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,085
Why do there have
to be puppets like Frank?

377
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,426
<i>- Think about it, Michael.</i>
- Well, it looks like we've got a mistrial.

378
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,627
But on the plus side,
we've also got a hung jury. Hit it!

379
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,706
You did good out there, Michael.

380
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,680
But it's just a mock trial.
Why don't you just take it to the grand jury?

381
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:22,152
Wanted to prove to you that I could do it.
I'm going to a grand jury with that now.

382
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,279
<i>Actually, Michael had no idea...</i>

383
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,789
<i>that's what he was supposed to do.</i>

384
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,020
Nice job. You have a real shot. You all
stuck together, and that's what wins cases.

385
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,857
We don't abandon each other.

386
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,297
- No one's closer than the Bluth family.
<i>- They were.</i>

387
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,528
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

388
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:43,006
<i>For as it turns out, the fake priest
was called to a patient's room...</i>

389
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,942
<i>and Father Ben filled in,
not knowing it was fake.</i>

390
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,479
<i>And that's how
the kids got married.</i>

391
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,141
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

392
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,584
Mock Trial with J. Reinhold
<i>leads to imitators.</i>

393
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,587
<i>All rise.</i> Bud Cort <i>is now in session.</i>

394
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:03,525
- Please be seated. - Hard to sit when
you got someone's hand up your ass.

395
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,529
All right, let's lose the puppet.

396
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:09,567
<i>And Michael discovers
that he wasn't N. Bluth after all.</i>

397
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,762
<i>I have an older sister?</i>

398
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,238
<i>So much for not abandoning family.</i>

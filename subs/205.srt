1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,619
<i>It was Monday morning...</i>

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,916
<i>and Michael Bluth</i>
<i>was nervous about meeting...</i>

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,458
<i>with the new prosecutor</i>
<i>ofhis father's criminal case.</i>

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,754
I don't know what you're
so nervous about, Michael.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,989
It's a new prosecutor.
It's a whole new beginning...

10
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,589
a new day, a new case,
a whole new set of lies.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,397
- I'm not lying anymore, Mom.
- <i>Michael was lying.</i>

12
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,495
<i>He found his fugitive father</i>
<i>earlier in the week...</i>

13
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,506
<i>and he was hiding him</i>
<i>in the attic...</i>

14
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,441
<i>where George Sr. Was currently</i>
<i>waiting for his breakfast.</i>

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,705
About the business,
just for the record...

16
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,373
I was not involved with Dad
building houses in Iraq.

17
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,110
- That's exactly what I'm gonna tell them.
- Is that for Lindsay?

18
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,379
<i>Because she's not scared</i>
<i>to eat in front of me anymore.</i>

19
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,387
<i>Those are</i>
<i>the whites only, yes?</i>

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,151
These aren't for Lindsay.
These are mine.

21
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,159
Anyway, I'm not lying
anymore either, Michael.

22
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,162
I'm being lied...

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,164
on.

24
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,291
Wow. Now more's gonna
come up than go down.

25
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,171
I gotta get outta here.

26
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,332
- Hmm?
- <i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

27
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,708
I mean, she's just
so loving and affectionate.

28
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,008
L- l-This is not the woman
I fell in love with.

29
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,242
Oscar, please. You can't go.
You gotta stay, okay?

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,285
This is the nicest she's been since
she found out Rosa could breast-feed Buster.

31
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,754
Oh, Buster. Don't even bring that up.
He's well into his army training.

32
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,156
<i>Actually, Buster had</i>
<i>hit a wall in his army training.</i>

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,354
I can't do it! I can't make my bed,
and I can't do this either!

34
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,628
Aren't you supposed to yell at me and call me
"homo" and motivate me over this wall?

35
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,861
We can't do that anymore. Lawsuit.

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,302
<i>In fact, it was a recent ruling...</i>

37
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,603
<i>prosecuted by the same man</i>
<i>who Michael was soon to meet with.</i>

38
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,507
It's going to be a long time
before Sergeant Wendell Baker...

39
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,103
calls someone
"Private Homo" again.

40
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,274
God willing,
he'll fail boot camp.

41
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,817
Well, why wouldn't he?
He already failed day camp.

42
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,444
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey, Dad.

43
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,490
- <i>You ready for the prosecutor?</i>
- Hi. I hope so.

44
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,152
- How'd that math test work out?
- Oh, it was okay, I guess.

45
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,627
But- I don't know.
It was weird. I studied with Ann...

46
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,630
but I still got a B-minus.

47
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,964
- Ann got you a B-minus?
- Well, it wasn't Ann. She's an expert in math.

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,800
- Isn't that cute?
- Is it?

49
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,067
<i>Michael felt his son</i>
<i>was setting the bar too low...</i>

50
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,473
<i>with his dating standards.</i>

51
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:30,015
No, it wasn't Ann's fault. I think I just
ended up thinkin' about the questions too long.

52
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,710
And so, by the time I put
an answer down, I went with, like...

53
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,719
my fifth choice
or somethin' like that.

54
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,982
George Michael,
never settle for fifth choice.

55
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,150
Something better is gonna come along.
She just has to.

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,990
I think maybe sitting in the back
of the class with Ann is a bad idea.

57
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,428
You know,
she's just so pretty.

58
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,898
- I get distracted, I guess.
- Do you?

59
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,562
- I wish I could draw her nose.
- Maybe it's your eyes.

60
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,099
Maybe you need glasses...
for your grades.

61
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,108
Didn't you say you had
a hard time readin' the board...

62
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,735
- sittin' in the back row?
- No, I said I was in the back of the classroom.

63
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,746
- That's what I mean. Yeah?
- It's different. No. No.

64
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,442
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

65
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,519
- No, definitely. I'll call the eye doctor.
- I guess.

66
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,917
I'm gonna set you up
an appointment. Okay?

67
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,217
- <i>Hey, gang.</i>
- Tobias.

68
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,918
Oh. Ooh, I'm afraid I'll have to
take them to go. I'm late for the gym.

69
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,927
Oh, and also,
here's a number...

70
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,055
in case the Blue Man Group
calls and needs an understudy.

71
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,963
I just found out
that my cellular telephone was a lemon.

72
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,298
- It didn't work.
- Neither do you.

73
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,464
Pretty brave card for <i>you</i> to play.

74
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,042
I just can't stand it. Tobias getting in shape...

75
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,043
For a bunch
of slutty gym rats.

76
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,773
- What's wrong with your voice?
- Nothing. I've been going out.

77
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,315
<i>Lindsay had been frequenting singles clubs...</i>

78
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,715
<i>also still hoping to make</i>
<i>her open marriage work</i>-

79
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,413
- Whoo!
- <i>which it won't.</i>

80
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,286
- I didn't catch that.
- Whoo!

81
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,262
I wonder how many women
he's slept with, if any.

82
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,264
Lindsay, it's not
a competition.

83
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,062
Of course it is, Michael.
That's why they call it scoring.

84
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,570
- Maybe in the '70s.
- That many? We've only
been doing this for a month.

85
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,072
Instead of competing with Tobias,
why don't you try spending...

86
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,609
- a little more time with your daughter?
- Why? Tobias doing that?

87
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,077
<i>At that moment, Lindsay's daughter...</i>

88
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,445
- <i>was in the process of wooing her own man.</i>
- Who is it?

89
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,816
- Steve Holt!
- <i>Maeby had even started</i>
<i>ordering unnecessary items...</i>

90
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,821
<i>just to have more occasions</i>
<i>to see him.</i>

91
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,982
Uh, you ordered a "Memories
ofThanksgiving" basket?

92
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,994
- Wow, that looks great.
- <i>Maeby, who's your friend?</i>

93
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,031
- Is this your sister?
- No.

94
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,191
<i>But you just made my day.</i>

95
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,997
Thank you for the basket.
See ya.

96
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,935
He thinks I'm cute.

97
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,737
He's 19. He's a senior
at my high school.

98
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,438
<i>And had been for several years.</i>

99
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,278
<i>You know what?</i>

100
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,378
I think I <i>am</i> gonna spend more time
with my daughter.

101
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,116
I can't promise you I won't tell
the prosecutor about that.

102
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,889
- Where you been?
- Are you wearing my
dead wife's maternity clothes?

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,560
Yeah. It's the only thing
I could find.

104
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,730
- <i>Where are the eggs?</i>
- Doctor says they're bad for the baby.

105
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,468
- So, you ready for this new prosecutor?
- I was until you came back.

106
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,476
You're not gonna
turn me in, are you?

107
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,741
Because I had no idea there were sanctions
against, uh, Iraq.

108
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,316
<i>You know, th-they sent me over there.</i>
<i>They said, "Go build."</i>

109
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,410
Uh- Uh, Do I look like
a criminal mastermind to you?

110
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,547
How do you get this ham open?
I can't- I can't get this ham open.

111
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,592
I'm not gonna turn you in. But you have put me
in a position where I'm gonna have to lie.

112
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,594
Why did you come back here
in the first place?

113
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,723
Oh, no reason. Your mother happens
to be <i>shtupping</i> my brother, that's all.

114
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,733
<i>I'm only here to find out</i>
<i>if I have a shot with her.</i>

115
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,066
If she's really in love with Oscar-
I don't know- to hell with her.

116
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,572
I'll just-
I'll just leave.

117
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,936
- I'll never come back.
- Great. She's really in love with him.

118
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,344
That's very funny.
I need you to find out, okay?

119
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,417
<i>'Cause ever since</i>
<i>l</i>- <i>I heard about this</i>-

120
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,644
I can't sleep.

121
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,085
I can't- I can't eat.

122
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,784
Oh. Look, it just peels off.
Isn't that clever?

123
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,988
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>George Michael was having his eye exam...</i>

124
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,531
<i>and finding it to be just as difficult</i>
<i>as his math exam.</i>

125
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,032
- One or two?
- Two. No. No, one.

126
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,696
- Okay. Two or three?
- Three.

127
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,906
Uh, unless three is too much
of an improvement.

128
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,704
I'm sorry.
Is one- Is one in the mix still?

129
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,939
<i>And Michael met</i>
<i>with the new prosecutor, WayneJarvis.</i>

130
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,573
I'm sorry. I don't understand
how this is not a conflict of interest.

131
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,777
You almost represented us,
and now you're the prosecutor.

132
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,786
The Patriot Act. Read it.

133
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,322
L-I'm not even the president anymore.
My brother Gob is.

134
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,619
<i>I spoke with Gob.</i>
<i>He appears to know nothing.</i>

135
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,456
<i>Yeah, that's not an act.</i>
<i>He twice tried to microwave...</i>

136
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,621
<i>a Ding Dong</i>
<i>while it was still in its foil.</i>

137
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,392
- Twice.
- Twice?

138
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,630
- Two times.
- <i>In fact, Gob had been grilled earlier.</i>

139
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,570
- I don't know anything about the business!
- We're gonna get you, Bluth.

140
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,836
We'll give you a few minutes
to think about what you want to do.

141
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,011
He knows less than anyone
we have ever questioned.

142
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,583
<i>Gob knew too little</i>
<i>to know that, however...</i>

143
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,176
<i>and his confidence</i>
<i>had never been more shaken.</i>

144
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,587
<i>Andjust when he thought he couldn't</i>
<i>handle another embarrassment</i>-

145
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,591
You're free to go.

146
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,629
<i>Things could get very messy for you, Michael,</i>
<i>unless you have something to bargain with...</i>

147
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,165
like, say, a fugitive.

148
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,599
- I don't know where to find such a thing.
- <i>Look harder.</i>

149
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,933
- There might be something in it for you.
- Something to get me off?

150
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,837
<i>If</i> you could find
a certain someone.

151
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,537
Can I have a moment alone
with my client, please?

152
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,082
Did you follow any of that?

153
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,549
Yeah. He's hinting that
he's gonna grant me immunity...

154
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,847
but only on the condition
that I turn in my father.

155
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,855
You know where your father is?
No, wait. Don't tell me now.

156
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,484
<i>Okay. If you know,</i>
<i>give me a high five.</i>

157
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,029
Mm-mmm.

158
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,466
<i>Michael hadjust found out...</i>

159
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,563
<i>that his legal problems might go away</i>
<i>ifhe turned in his father.</i>

160
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,642
It's just you and me now, huh?

161
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:01,202
No, Barry, l- I know
where my father is, okay?

162
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,477
He came back to make sure that my mother
wasn't really in love with my uncle.

163
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,815
He wants to know if he's still got a shot with her.
If he doesn't, he's leaving.

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,548
If he's got a shot with her,
just give me a little tap on the fanny.

165
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,556
- That's not gonna happen.
- Okay.

166
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,389
Then look, just tell him anything
he wants to hear to keep him from running.

167
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,760
We just have to keep him here
until we can hear...

168
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,765
what kind of deal
they're offering you.

169
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,200
You just trust me.
I'm a lot more competent than you can imagine.

170
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,007
Oh, I forgot to take
the tinfoil off too.

171
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,008
I really wanted that.

172
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,170
<i>Buster, meanwhile, was sharing his failure...</i>

173
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,009
<i>with someone who was</i>
<i>well-versed on the subject.</i>

174
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:40,108
I mean, I couldn't get over the wall.
They put me on suspension until I can.

175
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,449
Perhaps you need to find somebody
who can motivate you.

176
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,285
- Yeah, but who?
- <i>And then it hit him.</i>

177
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,519
<i>Gob had always proven</i>
<i>a good motivator for Buster.</i>

178
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,086
Do it!

179
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,292
When you do this without getting punched
in the chest, you'll have more fun.

180
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,063
- Thanks, Brother.
- Hey, Brother...

181
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,798
how would you like to go
to the old playground with me?

182
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,308
I'm sure as hell not gonna go back to work.
I'm never going back there.

183
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,813
Oh. Well, then perchance I might be able
to borrow your cellular telephone?

184
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,315
I'm not fit
to run a company.

185
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,317
And I don't deserve
a fancy phone.

186
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,549
Well, the Blue Man Group might need me.
And I <i>do</i> deserve a fancy phone.

187
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,057
<i>They didn't, and he doesn't.</i>

188
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,627
<i>Michael knew he couldn't</i>
<i>let his father get away.</i>

189
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,186
<i>So he decided to see ifhis mother</i>
<i>and Oscar really were in love.</i>

190
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,632
So, come on. Aren't you really just dating
Oscar to get back at Dad?

191
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,260
Oh, it may have
started as that...

192
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,239
but I have
fallen in love with Oscar.

193
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,072
And it's so nice not to have to worry
about getting pregnant.

194
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,170
The doctor said
I couldn't be a mother now if I tried.

195
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,306
And that was without
even interviewing me.

196
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,408
Here you go. Hot tea.

197
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,750
Because that's what you are-
a hottie.

198
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,692
Stop me from pouring this on myself.
I can't take this anymore.

199
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,696
All right. Now, listen, Oscar.

200
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,993
Maybe you should think
about moving on, you know.

201
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,934
This really isn't your scene,
with the sweaters and the furniture.

202
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,006
Maybe you should take a leap at freedom,
like my father.

203
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,007
Just run.

204
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,044
Is that her rape horn?

205
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,376
It's more like
a starter's pistol.

206
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,043
Run.

207
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,482
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias set about</i>
<i>learning how to operate his new cell phone.</i>

208
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,059
Oh!

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,095
<i>And Lindsay tried to spend</i>
<i>more time getting to know her daughter.</i>

210
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,792
Hi, baby. Oh, Steve. Hi.

211
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,130
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

212
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,397
I thought I'd spend a little time
with my daughter.

213
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,837
After all, it hasn't been that long
since <i>I've</i> been in high school.

214
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,966
Is that a fire?

215
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,409
- We have to go to class.
- Okay. Well, this was fun.

216
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:52,314
Maybe later we can all spend a little
more time together. Go shopping. Get a drink.

217
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,648
<i>I'm in school.</i>
<i>And I'm 15.</i>

218
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,656
Oh. Well, I'm much, much, much...

219
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,658
older than 15.

220
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,661
- You don't look it.
- Oh, Steve.

221
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,527
He thinks I'm young.
You made my day again!

222
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,465
- Your mom's pretty, uh, out there.
- She's not my mom.

223
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,564
But she said
you were her daughter.

224
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,008
His daughter.
That's my dad.

225
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,773
- That's a dude?
- And the worst part is...

226
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,781
he thinks he's passing.

227
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,946
<i>Right outside the school,</i>
<i>Buster tried to put his own plan...</i>

228
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,422
<i>into action</i>
<i>by stirring up old memories.</i>

229
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,688
What do you say?
I need your help to get over the wall. Push me.

230
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,729
I'm the pathetic one, Buster,
not you.

231
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,355
I totally freaked out in front
of that prosecutor today.

232
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,299
Like a little girl
in a little dress-

233
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,371
little saddle shoes,
little pigtails.

234
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,702
Wow, that does sound
like a little girl.

235
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,935
<i>Come on, get my ire up.</i>

236
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,943
Push me!

237
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,945
Oh.

238
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,814
Oh, this is turning out to be
much more fun than I'd hoped.

239
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,581
<i>It was fun. But it wasn't</i>
<i>making him a better soldier.</i>

240
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,588
Push me higher.

241
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,658
Ooh! I'll do it.

242
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,760
Whoo!

243
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,195
<i>And Michael reported to</i>
<i>his father about his meeting with the prosecutor.</i>

244
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,699
- Prosecutor offer you a deal?
- That was not said.

245
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:21,068
But, uh, more importantly, you should know
that it seems like Oscar's on his way out.

246
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,734
- Really?
- Yeah. So just sit tight,
and everything should be fine.

247
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,076
<i>Wow. Hey, by the way,</i>
<i>I broke this thing. L</i>-

248
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,979
- What the hell is it anyway?
- That's a breast pump, Dad.

249
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,281
Oh. Well, I did not
use it for that.

250
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,686
<i>And so Michael went to meet the prosecutor.</i>

251
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,816
I felt obligated to share
some photographs with you.

252
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,087
I obtained these from
the Bluth Company e-mail server.

253
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,595
You tapped into our e-mail?
That's legal?

254
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,598
I'm going for a hot Ding Dong.

255
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,635
Hot Ding Dong? Yeah?

256
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,433
Michael, this is a close-up satellite photograph
of the Iraqi countryside.

257
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,031
See this little series of hills
around that stream?

258
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,134
Those are bunkers.
We believe that those bunkers...

259
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,372
contain weapons
of mass destruction.

260
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,314
We also think that your father
was building on that land to hide them.

261
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,113
Which is why that photograph
was on <i>his</i> e-mail.

262
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,848
- Are you serious?
- Almost always.

263
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,323
I was once called the worst audience
participant Cirque Du Soleil ever had.

264
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,623
- This is a big accusation.
- I did not find their buffoonery amusing.

265
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,463
- About my father.
- He's guilty, Michael, of medium to heavy treason.

266
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,661
That proves it.
You can't protect him.

267
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,637
Turn him in
and immunity is yours.

268
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,509
<i>Michael returned home</i>
<i>to confront his father.</i>
- <i>Michael?</i>

269
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,511
Mom was just here
looking for you.

270
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,808
She's claiming Oscar's disappeared
because of something you said.

271
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,884
- Can't talk right now.
- Really?

272
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,975
What's wrong with <i>your</i> voice?

273
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,680
I can talk, sure.
I didn't say anything to Oscar.

274
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,689
- Anything else?
- No.

275
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,726
Oh. Hey, did I tell you?
I accidentally ran into Steve Holt.

276
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,388
Wow. Everything about you
is so womanly.

277
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,658
You're everything
a woman should be.

278
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,360
Thank you, Steve.

279
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,060
We ended up
making a lunch date.

280
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,104
I thought you were
spending time with Maeby.

281
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,197
Yeah. I'll have to
reschedule her.

282
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,404
But Mom isn't the only one "finding love"
where she least expects it. Her words.

283
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,278
Wh-Whoa! Finding love-
She said that? Where, here?

284
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,282
Yeah, she won't
shut up about him.

285
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,352
She said "tingling,"
like, 75 times.

286
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:19,220
<i>Gets me tingling.</i>
<i>And, you know, with Oscar there's tingling.</i>

287
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,523
- She said those words in this house?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,358
Dad?

289
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,364
Hello?

290
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,467
<i>Michael hadjust discovered</i>
<i>that his father had escaped from the attic.</i>

291
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,474
Hello?

292
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,101
This is gonna sound like a strange question,
but have you seen Dad?

293
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,112
Of course not.
And I'm not talking to you.

294
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,648
You tried to scare away Oscar,
which didn't work.

295
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,583
- He's back.
- I just, uh-

296
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,985
I just wanted to have sex with you.
That's-That's all I'm good for.

297
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,650
Did you hear that?
He said he just wants to-

298
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,250
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Have sex with me.

299
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,991
- You smell like a pinecone.
- Yeah, that's the weed.

300
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,626
I went to my, uh,
my- hole trailer...

301
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,932
and l- I smoked some
like a cigarette.

302
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,473
Should we take it
into the bedroom?

303
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,008
- Only if you really love me.
- Of course I do.

304
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,115
Ohh.

305
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,620
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>

306
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,747
I'm on mushrooms!

307
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,759
I'm on bad mushrooms!

308
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,489
<i>And soon,</i>
<i>the prosecutor's evidence became public.</i>

309
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,534
We've obtained photographs that officials
call definite proof of W.M.D.'s in Iraq.

310
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,933
What that means
for your weekend at 10:00.

311
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,667
<i>It seems that due</i>
<i>to the new information-sharing provisions...</i>

312
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,209
<i>in the Patriot Act, the photos</i>
<i>had made the rounds...</i>

313
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,337
<i>through several branches</i>
<i>of government...</i>

314
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,574
<i>and ultimately</i>
<i>to the U.S. Army itself.</i>

315
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,810
I just came back to tell you.
I can't do that wall.

316
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,148
There's no time for that.
We're shipping out without you.

317
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,313
- What?
- Didn't you see?

318
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:02,122
- <i>Pick it up. Pick it up.</i>
- Weapons of mass destruction?

319
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,354
- Those bastards.
- I did not say that.

320
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,365
Are you gonna let that slide?
Are you gonna allow your children...

321
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,492
and your children's children...

322
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,570
and any children
that I might have out there...

323
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,401
to live in fear
for the rest of their lives?

324
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,340
Climb that wall, homo!

325
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,378
Climb it.

326
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,346
<i>Andjust as the men</i>
<i>thought the day could get no more surprising...</i>

327
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,349
<i>it did.</i>

328
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,351
Ohh! Ooh!

329
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,911
When you do this without getting
punched, you'll have more fun.

330
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,424
- Oh, hey, George Michael.
- Oh, hi.

331
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,517
They found W.M.D.'s in Iraq,
so we got a half-day.

332
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,597
Cool. So I got
a "C" on my math test.

333
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,928
Not anticipating
a good reaction on that.

334
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,526
Well, the "B" got you glasses.
Maybe this time you'll get a neck brace.

335
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,936
Anyways, have you seen my mom?

336
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,941
Seems possible.

337
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,341
- She's on her way to meet Steve Holt.
- I thought <i>you</i> liked him.

338
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,743
I do. I'm crazy about him.
But he's obsessed with her.

339
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,748
<i>That's all he wants</i>
<i>to talk about.</i>

340
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,410
<i>Lindsay felt bad.</i>
<i>Perhaps she had hurt her daughter...</i>

341
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,419
<i>by putting herself first.</i>

342
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,012
<i>But she would have felt worse</i>
<i>if she'd remained even a moment longer.</i>

343
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,456
But it's only because
he thinks she's got a penis.

344
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,720
Oh, I told him
she was a tranny.

345
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,126
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was still up in the attic.</i>

346
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,495
Dad, what's goin' on?
Somebody could see you.

347
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,036
What's the difference, Mike?
You're turning me in, aren't you?

348
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,970
They say you're involved in something
real big, Dad. They've got photos.

349
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,439
Not true. But go.
Knock yourself out. Turn me in.

350
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,773
<i>I went and I saw for myself.</i>

351
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,779
She's in love with him.

352
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,481
<i>Then why did you come back?</i>
<i>Why didn't you just leave forever like you said?</i>

353
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,486
And go where?

354
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,455
Make a deal for yourself, Mike.

355
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,549
I got no love
in my life anymore.

356
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,094
<i>And Michael realized for the first time...</i>

357
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,825
<i>that his father was capable</i>
<i>ofhaving his heart broken.</i>

358
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,060
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>Michael had his meeting with the prosecutor.</i>

359
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,332
So, where the hell is he?
Come on, Bluth. What's it gonna be?

360
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,999
Your father or your freedom?

361
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,508
<i>And Michael had to do the right thing.</i>

362
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,135
I don't know
what happened to him.

363
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,641
Michael, when we started talking to you,
we didn't have anything.

364
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,482
But now... we got something.

365
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,489
- And you're gonna do time for it.
- Those are the pictures?

366
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,991
They're all over the news.

367
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,460
- Those are balls.
- What?

368
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,930
<i>Barry was right. Tobias had</i>
<i>inadvertently photographed himself...</i>

369
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,933
<i>while learning to use</i>
<i>his camera phone.</i>

370
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,198
See, uh, this close,
they always look like landscape.

371
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,502
Nope, you're lookin' at balls.

372
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,168
<i>Soon, forensic scientists confirmed this.</i>

373
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,302
<i>And for the second time</i>
<i>in two days...</i>

374
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,849
<i>the information-sharing network</i>
<i>put into place by the Patriot Act...</i>

375
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,850
<i>was put to use.</i>

376
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,716
They're balls?

377
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,721
<i>We're looking at balls. Let's turn it around.</i>

378
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,723
<i>Copy on balls. We're turning.</i>

379
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,293
<i>And eventually, the news</i>
<i>traveled back to the source.</i>

380
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,886
We got one wrong,
and we do apologize.

381
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm on TV.

382
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,700
<i>And Michael returned home a free man.</i>

383
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,037
You got the glasses.
Now you'll do better on those math exams.

384
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,579
I think I blew the eye exam too.
Every time I take these off, I feel better.

385
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,705
Let me see 'em.

386
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,910
- I've seen this before.
- <i>For a while, George Michael...</i>

387
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,283
<i>had shared a room</i>
<i>with his Uncle Tobias.</i>

388
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,982
- Oh, th-there's a ladder.
- I don't need it.

389
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,894
Yeah, I don't think
you need glasses, Son.

390
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,360
Well, if the cops are waiting,
I'm ready to go.

391
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,435
I got nothin'
since your mother deserted me.

392
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,436
You know,
you-you deserted her, Dad.

393
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,438
You know, you escaped,
and then you faked your death.

394
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,838
I'm not so sure she sees you
as that reliable.

395
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,274
But, listen,
for what it's worth...

396
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,278
I did not turn you in.

397
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,116
- You didn't?
- No.

398
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,777
And I don't know whether
it's just Tracy's maternity clothes...

399
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,549
but it's very nice to see
a softer side of you.

400
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,956
Although I'm sorry that you feel
you have no love in your life.

401
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,460
Well, I don't-
I don't feel that way anymore.

402
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,932
Thanks.

403
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,798
Been a long time
since someone stood up for me.

404
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,967
- Found her perfume, huh?
- Just a little left in the bottle.

405
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,135
- Well, that was the end of it.
- Yeah.

406
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,145
- It's nice on you.
- Thank you.

407
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,045
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

408
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,210
<i>Oscar returns to find</i>
<i>a now-distant Lucille.</i>

409
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,414
I'm back.
But just for now.

410
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,548
'Cause you get
on my case- shoo-

411
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,388
- I am out of here.
- Then go. Who needs you?

412
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,428
<i>Which was what attracted him to her...</i>

413
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,556
- <i>in the first place.</i>
- God, I missed you.

414
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,999
- <i>Lindsay reconciles with her daughter.</i>
- Hey, Mom. I got you somethin'.

415
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,196
That is so sweet.

416
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,739
You know what? I was hoping
we could go to dinner tonight.

417
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,309
Oh, I thought you were gonna
go see Steve Holt at school.

418
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,310
No, I just wanted
to check him out...

419
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,176
and make sure he's good enough
for my daughter.

420
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,648
- Is it-
- It's a "Sheh-ma-lee."

421
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,719
It's gorgeous.

422
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,845
I'm wearing it to dinner.

423
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,753
<i>Tobias, traumatized by the public exposure...</i>

424
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,951
<i>returns to</i>
<i>an unfortunate quirk.</i>

425
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,028
Thank God!
My cutoffs.

426
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,700
There were
cutoffs up here?

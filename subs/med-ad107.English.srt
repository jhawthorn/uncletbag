1
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,590
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:24,440
<i>Michael Bluth was fed up</i>
<i>with his mother's extravagant spending.</i>

6
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:27,241
Hey, Mom. Remember we had that
conversation about trying to...

7
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:29,213
cut back on things
that aren't necessities?

8
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,115
- Like it was yesterday.
- It was this morning...

9
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,847
and now I hear that you've hired
a crew for the yacht.

10
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:38,585
- I'm selling that yacht.
- Michael, you haven't heard <i>why</i> I want it.

11
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:43,027
To throw the most lavish party this town
has ever seen for my birthday.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,395
I enjoy bicentennials as much as
the next guy, Mom, but we're not doing that.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,766
My neighbor Lucille Austero is
constantly throwing parties for herself.

14
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:54,136
- She's having another one in a week.
- I'm not going to that.

15
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,141
<i>Buster had been avoiding</i>
<i>Lucille Austero...</i>

16
00:00:56,243 --> 00:01:00,873
<i>since he accidentally flirted with her</i>
<i>while not wearing his glasses.</i>

17
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:03,883
<i>And then accidentally bid on her</i>
<i>at a charity bachelorette auction.</i>

18
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:07,045
- Ten thousand dollars!
- Buster.

19
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:10,715
<i>And then accidentally entered</i>
<i>her apartment, thinking it was his mother's.</i>

20
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:12,952
I need you right now.

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,223
Fellas, take a powder.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,197
Oh, here comes the 10:15
conniption, right on time.

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,758
Honest to God, Buster, it's like every little
thing makes you seize up in terror lately.

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,566
I have no idea where you get that from.

25
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,836
Get away from that stove.
You're going to light your hair on fire.

26
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:32,744
He's weak.

27
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:35,907
Speaking of weak, Mom,
what do you got in there, gold bars?

28
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:41,246
Protein bars for your father.
He's pumping up in prison.

29
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:45,758
- No more parties. Okay, Mom?
- You're my third least-favorite child.

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,158
I can live with that.

31
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:52,198
<i>Michael came home to find</i>
<i>his mother's fourth least-favorite child.</i>

32
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,462
- Heard you're selling the yacht.
- Yeah. I had a couple in there this morning.

33
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,968
Yeah, I know.

34
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:03,609
Well, they got the Asian right.

35
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:08,011
"Hotties" might be a stretch.

36
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:11,676
Well, let's start with the little one.

37
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:15,381
- You're not staying on the yacht, are you?
- What do you want me to do?

38
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,118
- Live full-time with Marta?
- Or break up with her.

39
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:22,024
I'm sure there'd be somebody else
out there that would appreciate her.

40
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,222
<i>In fact, Michael felt</i>
<i>that man was himself.</i>

41
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:28,233
<i>He had become infatuated</i>
<i>with his brother's girlfriend...</i>

42
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,168
<i>and was having difficulty</i>
<i>keeping his love a secret.</i>

43
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:33,797
You have 48 hours to vacate the yacht.

44
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:38,368
Guys, I've got a great idea.
I wanna throw Mom a party.

45
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,312
Would you...
I just told Mom no more parties.

46
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:45,545
I know, Michael. That's why this is the perfect
opportunity to throw her a surprise party.

47
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:47,985
- She'd never suspect it.
- Is this her suggestion?

48
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,991
No. I just think it's important to
honor your parents.

49
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:55,893
Why don't you start by visiting Dad in jail?
You've never even been there.

50
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:59,625
Michael, do you have any idea what
would happen if I were to visit prison?

51
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,895
- Hmm.
- It would be pandemonium.

52
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,993
- Mm-hmm.
- It'd just give Dad one more reason to think...

53
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,505
that I've got nothing
to offer but my looks.

54
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:10,543
Yeah, I got some of that...
except he also didn't like my looks.

55
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:14,577
Okay, Michael. I will go visit Dad...

56
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,673
if you drive Mom to the restaurant
for the surprise party.

57
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,582
I'll just pretend that
I'm taking her out that evening.

58
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,884
- Come on. That would never happen.
- She can't drive herself.

59
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,959
- I mean, she's the world's worst driver.
- <i>Lindsay was not exaggerating.</i>

60
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,020
<i>Lucille had recently been featured on</i>
<i>Fox's</i> World's Worst Drivers.

61
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:35,101
Yeah. I can't believe she got that
driver's license renewed.

62
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:38,399
She didn't. I dummied her up a new one.

63
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:40,235
Not my best work though.
She wanted to look 48.

64
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,901
<i>I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion.</i>

65
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,376
We ended up checking "Albino" on the form.

66
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,970
Come on, Michael. Who knows how long
our parents are going to be around.

67
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:51,381
I gotta tell ya. I was over at her
place today, and she looked a little frail.

68
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,886
She was having trouble even lifting up
this bag of groceries.

69
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,220
All right. We will do the surprise party.

70
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,953
<i>For Gangy?</i>

71
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:05,054
- Yeah, how did you know?
- She called and invited us.

72
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:09,159
- Okay, so it was her idea.
- We don't have to go, do we?

73
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,229
Come on. This is a Bluth family celebration.
It's no place for children.

74
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,277
<i>And Lindsay went to the prison</i>
<i>to visit her father for the first time.</i>

75
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,904
<i>But didn't get the reception</i>
<i>she was expecting.</i>

76
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,775
<i>I wanna thank you for coming here.</i>
<i>It took a lot of guts.</i>

77
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:30,289
The reason I'm here today is because
I felt that I needed to say something.

78
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,757
- Oh, okay.
- My whole life...

79
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,351
all you've ever praised me for is my looks.

80
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,930
- Oh, no. Your looks...
- Yes, Dad.

81
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,660
I mean, it's always been
Michael's got the brains...

82
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:44,431
Gob's got the charm,
Buster's got the...

83
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:48,334
- High-fastening pants.
- Have you said that?

84
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,376
No. I'm saying that now.

85
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,605
So, anyway. Look, if you're wondering why
I haven't visited...

86
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:57,047
maybe it's because I wanted to be thought
of as more than just a beautiful face.

87
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:00,120
And a gorgeous head of hair.

88
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,348
<i>Lindsay was surprised once</i>
<i>again that no heads were turned.</i>

89
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:12,356
I'm gonna go shopping.
I'll be back tomorrow.

90
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:14,335
<i>George Michael was finally</i>
<i>moving beyond his crush on Maeby...</i>

91
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:17,862
<i>George Michael was finally</i>
<i>moving beyond his crush on Maeby...</i>

92
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,338
<i>and felt happy to have a cousin</i>
<i>he couldjust see a movie with.</i>

93
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:25,640
<i>It was a love between two cousins</i>
<i>that the world thought was wrong.</i>

94
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:31,207
<i>But it was the world that was wrong.</i>

95
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:33,684
- We have got to see this movie.
- Excuse me, kids?

96
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:35,914
Can I see your I.D.'s?

97
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:43,154
<i>And Michael was driving his</i>
<i>mother to her surprise party.</i>

98
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,722
Where on earth are we going?

99
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:49,803
Left at the next corner.

100
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:51,838
- You know, Michael?
- Yeah?

101
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:54,237
I'd be happy to drive if you want me to.

102
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:57,606
It's better than sitting here
with Buster's stupid rock behind me.

103
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,679
<i>Buster had recently</i>
<i>brought the rock home...</i>

104
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,910
<i>from an archeological dig, but had yet</i>
<i>to find a way to get it out of the car.</i>

105
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,714
Mom, you've already got
two strikes on your record.

106
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,187
You strike one more person,
and it's technically a spree.

107
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:16,856
Are we going to the back?
Is this what I think it is?

108
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:21,367
- Surprise!
- <i>And she was surprised...</i>

109
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:26,531
- <i>that her family didn't show up.</i>
- So this is what my children think of me.

110
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:42,080
Where the... was everybody?

111
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,919
- What are you talking about?
- Mom's party. Where were you guys?

112
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:47,893
It's the first I've heard about it.

113
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:53,296
- What about you? Neiman's?
- Prison.

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,894
Then Neiman's. But only because I'm going
back to prison, and they've seen me in this.

115
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:02,135
Buster? You of all people.
Where were you, buddy?

116
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,073
You barely even leave Mom's apartment.

117
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:08,012
<i>In fact, Buster was worried</i>
<i>about running into Lucille 2.</i>

118
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:10,140
<i>So he never left his mother's apartment.</i>

119
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,051
<i>Lucille 2 was also supposed to go, but</i>
<i>was waiting until she saw Buster emerge.</i>

120
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,486
Tonight, Mother was humiliated.

121
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,394
And I wanna throw her another
surprise party... a real one.

122
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,831
One where she's not the one
that's yelling "Surprise."

123
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:31,371
- Mom yelled "Surprise"?
- <i>Yeah. She went from giddy to devastated.</i>

124
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:33,997
I mean, it would've been funny
if it wasn't so...

125
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,372
Well, it was kind of funny.

126
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,604
What frail act got you this time, Michael?

127
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:43,149
She couldn't open a jar? What, did a clump
of her hair come out in your hands?

128
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,946
No. It was something that she said at dinner.

129
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,681
It's dry.

130
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:51,349
You know, Mom,
I'm sorry you're upset. But, you know...

131
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:55,451
if you were nicer, then maybe your kids
would take better care of you, you know?

132
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:58,030
Or-Or wanna be with you more.

133
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,295
I've been a horrible mother.

134
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:07,169
No, Mom. You're great.

135
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,572
You've been a great mother.

136
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:12,975
- Well, you know she's been
a horrible mother, right?
- You don't have to tell me.

137
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,572
But what was I gonna say?
All right? So, it's a party.

138
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,484
I mean, if you're not
gonna do it for Mom, do it for me.

139
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,317
Okay. But I think
a party's a little excessive.

140
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,721
Um, is it okay if I do it for Mom
and not you?

141
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:31,798
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I really like Mom.

142
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:34,663
We know.

143
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,134
<i>The next day, Buster decided</i>
<i>it was time to deal with...</i>

144
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,705
<i>the situation with Lucille Austero.</i>

145
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,435
I've already got a Lucille in my life.

146
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,912
I understand. That's healthy.

147
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:50,176
I didn't mean to lead you on.

148
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:53,515
- Oh, Buster. I feel so foolish.
- No.

149
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,080
Yes. I'm foolish
and I'm funny and I'm needy.

150
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,387
- Am I needy?
- No.

151
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:03,793
Are you sure I'm not needy?
'Cause I feel needy sometimes.

152
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,866
You know, we're probably
not that different, you and me.

153
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,527
You and I. Is it "l" or is it "me"?

154
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:14,471
- Buster, it's us.
- Yes. It is us. Us.

155
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,815
<i>Under the pretense of driving</i>
<i>his mother somewhere else...</i>

156
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:33,085
<i>Michael, once again,</i>
<i>arrived at the restaurant.</i>

157
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:35,753
Michael, did you do this again?

158
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:39,731
- Surprise!
- <i>And once again, no one showed up.</i>

159
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,733
<i>Get up.</i>

160
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,432
I told you. They don't support me.

161
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,838
I hate to tell you, Mom,
but they don't support me either.

162
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:52,241
I sat down and I told them
this was important to me.

163
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:58,949
- You did that for me?
- I let you drive, didn't I?

164
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:02,510
Yes, you did, Michael, and I'm loving it.

165
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,081
You're a good son.
You always do things for others.

166
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,423
You're the only one
holding this family together.

167
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,089
And you see a lot more than
I give you credit for, Mom.

168
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:14,656
You're not just concerned with yourself.
You care about the family.

169
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,928
Hey. Is that Gob?

170
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:21,599
<i>It's an idiot on a scooter</i>
<i>at night? It's gotta be Gob.</i>

171
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,836
- Let's give him a scare.
- Hmm?

172
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:28,608
- No, Mom. I don't think we should.
- A nice little scare.

173
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:34,153
Hey, big shot, too busy to
go to your mother's party?

174
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:37,883
<i>Mom, that is not Gob. Mom! Mom!</i>

175
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,698
You okay, sir?

176
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:56,207
Yeah. I guess.
How's my mom? She's so frail.

177
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,269
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I was thrown clear.

178
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,144
I only care about you.

179
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,687
- How are you feeling?
- Actually, my head does not hurt at all.

180
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:17,753
- What did you give me?
- Your mother asked me to pump you full of...

181
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:21,698
- Children's aspirin.
- Okay.

182
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:25,932
You know, it's funny.
I remember, um, leaving the restaurant.

183
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,837
And then, uh, I was driving, I guess.

184
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,103
l-I just... I cannot picture it.

185
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:32,838
That's pretty common, actually.

186
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:36,507
It's just short-term memory loss from
the bump on the back of your head.

187
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:40,178
I can't believe I did this. My
insurance rates are gonna go through the roof.

188
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:44,724
That's not what matters now.
Here, get comfortable. Scoot up.

189
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:48,386
"Scoot"? Scooter.
Was there a scooter involved?

190
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:52,431
Oh, dear.
I can't believe I did that.

191
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:55,660
- I am so sorry. I'll get you some air.
- I hardly felt it.

192
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,636
In fact, actually, uh,
I didn't feel it.

193
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:02,175
What was that?

194
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:08,303
Buster, you remember
when we were kissing last night?

195
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:12,715
It was a wild, wild ride.

196
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,447
But is this something we can do?

197
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:18,524
Is this something society will allow?

198
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,116
I don't care what other people think.

199
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:26,689
My God, for the first time in years
I felt like I was standing on solid ground.

200
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,133
You know,
my panic attacks have decreased.

201
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:34,867
I feel confident. I'm feeling proud even.

202
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:38,809
I mean, for the first time
in my life...

203
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:46,643
I'll call Dr. Miller.

204
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,881
Oh. Excuse me.

205
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,450
Hello. Oh, my God.
I'm getting my gauze.

206
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:58,019
You know, I should call George Michael.
I'm worried about my son.

207
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:02,033
I'm worried about <i>my</i> son. George Michael
will be fine with his aunt and uncle.

208
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:05,593
<i>I want you resting, not using the phone.</i>

209
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:11,144
- Let me take care of you.
- You know, you really are more
generous than I can remember.

210
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:14,213
But that's what a parent does, huh?
You put your kid first?

211
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,143
Rest up, sweetie.
You gave me quite a scare.

212
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:25,156
Scare. Did somebody say,
"Let's give him a sc..."

213
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:30,218
What is the matter with me?
Clumsy Clara.

214
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,788
Totally cool. Didn't feel a thing.
You know, Mom, I'm crazy about this aspirin.

215
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,994
I can't believe we give it to children.

216
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:40,767
<i>Gob, meanwhile, was being</i>
<i>visited by Michael's son, George Michael.</i>

217
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,933
<i>Michael? George Michael.</i>

218
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:45,603
- <i>You've gotta go.</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

219
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:48,340
Uncle Gob, is this a bad time?

220
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,747
No. Are you kidding? So, what's up?

221
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:55,253
I, uh, need you to make
some fake I.D.'s for me and Maeby.

222
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:58,153
- Like a passport?
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be great.

223
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:02,285
Oh, and, uh, preferably French.
I like the way they think.

224
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:06,230
Look, I don't want you thinking that your uncle
is some sleazy character from the docks.

225
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,824
- Good morning.
- How are you?

226
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:14,233
She's an Olympian... hopeful.

227
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:19,142
Swimming and some coaching.
Yes, I will make the I.D.'s for you.

228
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:21,305
But we're gonna have to make this quick.
Your dad wants me out of here by noon.

229
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:23,975
I wouldn't worry about him.
He's staying at Gangy's.

230
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,143
Yeah, he got in a car accident on the way
back from her birthday party.

231
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:28,721
- Man, I told him not to let her drive.
- No. It was him driving.

232
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:32,553
She's taking good care of him too.
She won't even let him use the phone.

233
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,993
- So you're telling me that he can't go
anywhere <i>and</i> he's incommunicado?
- Right.

234
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:40,555
<i>That's when Gob decided to take</i>
<i>the yacht to South America for the summer.</i>

235
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:44,068
I gotta alert this boat's crew.

236
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,265
They'll be devastated.

237
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:53,309
<i>Lindsay put on her new outfit</i>
<i>and returned to prison.</i>

238
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,880
<i>Back at Lucille's, Michael was still</i>
<i>piecing together the accident.</i>

239
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,789
- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, brother.

240
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,189
- Dr. Miller?
- Yeah.

241
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,759
I just jumped through a plate glass window
on a date.

242
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,804
Oh. Well, women love to laugh.

243
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:23,433
It was worth it to be away from
Mom's controlling grasp.

244
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:27,809
<i>Buster, what's going on?</i>
<i>What happened to your head?</i>

245
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:31,509
Nothing. Gob was just teaching me
how to hit it with a hammer.

246
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:34,086
Gob was there.

247
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:36,815
Gob was on his scooter.

248
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,823
I think I wanted to hit Gob.

249
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:43,658
Yes. That is exactly what happened.
You wanted to give Gob a scare.

250
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,560
I don't know why.

251
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:49,996
I think I do.

252
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,040
Thanks, Mom.

253
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:01,447
<i>George Sr. was once again</i>
<i>being visited by his daughter.</i>

254
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,675
That's it. I don't want...
You can't... I don't...

255
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,774
Please, you gotta stop coming here.

256
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,820
It is obvious I'm not wearing a bra, right?

257
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:13,223
I can't take this anymore. I, um...
Uh, I'm paying far too big a price for this.

258
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:16,523
Well, what about me?
This is the third time I've come here.

259
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,691
- I haven't even been remotely harassed.
- That is not what I'm paying for.

260
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,894
Have I lost it?
Did I ever even have it?

261
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:26,131
I'm paying thousands
of dollars in Krugerrands.

262
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,469
- What?
- Gold. Krugerrands.

263
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:32,705
Your mother snuck 'em in here
stuffed in energy bar wrappers...

264
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:36,748
to keep me from getting
strangled in the shower or worse.

265
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,149
- Stabbed?
- In a way.

266
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:43,381
I used them to pay off
the other guys.

267
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,484
To stop them from hollering
obscenities at my... my little girl.

268
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:52,998
But you keep coming back here, honey,
and I'm going broke.

269
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:57,329
That's all I ever wanted from you, Daddy.

270
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,837
For you to spend money on me.

271
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:05,604
<i>No touching!</i>

272
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:09,575
Gob, I want you to
move back on to the yacht.

273
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,811
The yacht? What makes you think
I'd want to now?

274
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,853
Well, I know that
you've been looking for...

275
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,354
What was that?

276
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:18,424
I think that was on your end.

277
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:21,892
The truth is, I can wait on selling the yacht.
It's just money, right?

278
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:24,623
Wow. How hard did you hit
that steering wheel?

279
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:27,859
- I actually hit the back of my head.
- The back of your head?

280
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:31,665
Yeah. Gob, the accident
only happened because...

281
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:34,239
I was trying to scare you.

282
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:37,401
- Maybe even hurt you.
- That doesn't sound like you.

283
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,410
It sounds like Mom.

284
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:42,242
Can we please just lay
off Mom for a change?

285
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,944
She's the one that helped me remember
what happened. I'm the bad guy here. Not her.

286
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:50,921
And definitely not you,
so, would you please just take the yacht?

287
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:53,584
I'll think about it.

288
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:58,953
South America sounds good.

289
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,364
But a chance to expose Mom?

290
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:06,769
- Turn this skiff around.
- We haven't even left the dock.

291
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,638
But "skiff" is appropriate, right?

292
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:14,440
<i>Gob rushed to shore</i>
<i>to spare his brother...</i>

293
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:16,674
<i>from what he was certain</i>
<i>were his mother's machinations.</i>

294
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:19,752
- What are you doing?
- <i>Hey. Open this door.</i>

295
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,821
- You've been set up.
- <i>Michael!</i>

296
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:24,719
There's no way you were trying to hurt me.
You don't hate me.

297
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:27,418
Mom hates me.
You kind of like me.

298
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,154
- Yeah. I kind of like you.
- Yeah.

299
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:32,095
- <i>Michael, I need your help.</i>
- Coming.

300
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:35,133
- Ow! I got hit back there.
- Right!

301
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,534
On the back of the head, which means that
you couldn't have hit the steering wheel.

302
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:41,607
Mom must have clubbed you with a
champagne bottle or something so she could drive.

303
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,370
- Gob, how'd you figure it out?
- It's funny you should ask that...

304
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:46,775
No. He didn't figure anything out.

305
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,974
I probably got hit on the back of the head
because of Buster's rock.

306
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,052
Hey, big shot!

307
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,514
Which was behind the passenger seat.

308
00:18:56,623 --> 00:19:00,787
Which means that she picked you up
and dragged you over to the driver's seat.

309
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:04,295
Mom can't pick me up. She could barely
pick up that bag of protein bars.

310
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,461
<i>Guess what? They weren't protein bars.</i>

311
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:12,027
They were gold Krugerrands.
And Dad finally paid attention to my intellect.

312
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,799
- Open this door!
- Gob, this is nuts.

313
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,535
Mother is frail.

314
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:19,305
- Stop this nonsense this instant!
- You set him up, Mom.

315
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:22,711
I was halfway to South America,
but I couldn't let you get away with it...

316
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:26,274
because we're brothers, Mom,
and we kind of like each other.

317
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:31,924
- You were going to South America?
- I don't think so.

318
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:37,225
Mom, you and I were getting along so well.
I was thinking so highly of you.

319
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,924
How could you make me think
this was all my fault?

320
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,331
Because if you knew it was my fault,
you would've turned against me.

321
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:46,769
And I had finally gotten you on my side.
You were sticking up for me.

322
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:49,103
l-I don't even remember
you ever doing that before.

323
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:51,905
I just want my children to love me.

324
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:56,175
<i>Stop lying. Stop manipulating.</i>
<i>Just be nicer.</i>

325
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,341
But...

326
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:07,460
You're right.

327
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:15,926
I'm a horrible mother.

328
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:22,236
- No, no, Mom. You're great.
- That's crazy talk.

329
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,742
- You're a fantastic mother.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing, Mother.

330
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:27,039
Oh, we do. We really love you.

331
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,115
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

332
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:33,345
<i>George Michael and Maeby sneak back</i>
<i>into</i> Les Cousins Dangereux.

333
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,217
Excuse me. You're too young to be
holding that ticket.

334
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,983
- Let's go.
- I can't go to jail.

335
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:41,219
- Let's just watch cartoons.
- Sir, we will not be starting with <i>Les Cousins...</i>

336
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:44,956
- until you leave.
- Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card...

337
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:48,522
- was good for one and a guest.
- You know what?
I knew society would never accept this.

338
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:53,595
And they never will.
- <i>Michael's</i>
<i>insurance takes another hit.</i>

339
00:20:57,043 --> 00:21:01,173
Ow!

340
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,977
I was definitely driving that time.

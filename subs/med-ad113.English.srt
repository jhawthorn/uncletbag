1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of</i>
<i>a wealthy family who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:09,789
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

3
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:17,567
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

4
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:24,341
<i>Michael was sharing his bed</i>
<i>for the first time in years.</i>

5
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:27,846
<i>Unfortunately, it was with</i>
<i>his younger brother, Buster.</i>

6
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:35,383
Buster.
Buster.

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,423
Hey-Hey.
Whoa, whoa. Buster!

8
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:41,052
Hey, Brother.

9
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:44,757
I don't think us sleeping together
is working out.

10
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,732
You're a grown man.
You should be living with your mother.

11
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:50,633
- Yeah, I miss Mom.
- I can tell.

12
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:55,505
- Hey, good morning. What are you doing?
- It's my ethics essay.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm supposed to write 200 words
on the morality of war...

14
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,413
whether a preemptive strike
is ever justified.

15
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:04,746
Absolutely. It's <i>preemptive,</i> you know,
happens before something else. So...

16
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:07,514
if you can predict aggression
and you wanna squash it...

17
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:09,749
I don't know why you're not typing?
This is all good.

18
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:13,122
I'm not sure if my ethics teacher
would love if I cheated on my essay.

19
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:15,457
Well, you just passed my ethics test.

20
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:18,327
<i>In fact, George Michael</i>
<i>had developed a hopeless crush...</i>

21
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:21,367
<i>on his ethics teacher,</i>
<i>a woman named Beth Baerly.</i>

22
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,960
Even minor crimes are punishable...

23
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:26,437
by brutally chopping off
the offender's hand.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,270
Mmm. No ring.

25
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:32,107
- Can't wait to meet her
at Parent-Teacher Night.
- <i>Oh yeah. Dad, hey, Dad...</i>

26
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,613
- try to remember everything
she says about me, all right?
- Okay.

27
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,683
Michael.

28
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:39,275
I need you to do something
about my son.

29
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,719
I totally agree, Mom. Buster
goes home, we flip the mattress...

30
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:45,485
- this never happened.
- Not Buster. Read this.

31
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,863
<i>Did you and Dad adopt a child?</i>

32
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,899
<i>The S.E.C. was onto us.</i>

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,128
Your father thought it would
make us look charitable.

34
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:58,637
He must have forged my signature.

35
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,798
<i>Well, maybe I'll get a son who</i> will...

36
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:04,639
<i>finish his cottage cheese!</i>

37
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,508
You've got to get me out of this.

38
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:09,674
I'll call Social Services,
but you must take Buster back.

39
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,684
- Okay.
- Great.

40
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:13,754
But I'm not taking care
of him either.

41
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:17,221
I don't have the milk
of mother's kindness in me anymore.

42
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:20,816
Yeah, that udder's been dry
for a while now, hasn't it?

43
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:23,192
Kind of?

44
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,998
- Hello.
- Michael.

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,261
I've got
a couple of girls here.

46
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:30,929
A couple of <i>fun</i> girls...

47
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:34,166
- I thought I'd bring you in on.
- Oh, I don't know, Gob.

48
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,675
<i>Come on, Michael.</i>
<i>So we had a little disagreement.</i>

49
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:38,836
<i>Recently, Gob</i>
<i>had discovered that Michael...</i>

50
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:41,847
<i>was interested in his</i>
<i>now ex-girlfriend, Marta.</i>

51
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,383
I'm offering you an olive branch here.

52
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:46,612
Yeah-Yeah. No. l-I know,
and l-I appreciate that. It's just...

53
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,383
Besides, when was the last
time you slept with someone?

54
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,220
- Buster.
- What time and where?

55
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,454
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay was helping</i>
<i>George Michael with his homework.</i>

56
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:58,964
- Oh, come on, let's do something.
It's just a stupid essay.
- No, I can't.

57
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,728
I don't want to let down Ms. Baerly.
She's nice, you know.

58
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:05,536
- And she's interesting...
- And pretty?

59
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,200
Well, I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

60
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,972
I guess there's just some things
you can't really say to your dad.

61
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,810
Ah. Sounds like you'd like her
to be more than just your teacher.

62
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,875
<i>Lindsay believed that</i>
<i>George Michael wanted to fix up his father...</i>

63
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:22,285
<i>so he could fill the role ofhis mother.</i>

64
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,687
There's nothing wrong with that.

65
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:29,820
Although, I must say I'm a little
hurt that you haven't considered me.

66
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:34,362
- You're my aunt.
- That doesn't matter.

67
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:38,700
Aunts can fill that role.
Teachers can fill that role.

68
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,572
And, someday, you're gonna find
the right woman to fill that role.

69
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:46,976
But until then,
I'll be right across the hall.

70
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:53,820
<i>Lindsay had never been more</i>
<i>proud of anything she had said in her entire life.</i>

71
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:58,057
Yikes.
- <i>Meanwhile, Gob</i>
<i>was waiting for Michael to show up.</i>

72
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,595
- Oh, there he is. Michael.
- Yes.

73
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:04,095
This is Shannon, the girl
I've been telling you all about.

74
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:06,325
Yes.
Girl, indeed... young girl.

75
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,163
- That's a young, young, young, girl.
- Yeah, well, she's 18.

76
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,602
So, it's like...
Oh, and <i>this</i> is...

77
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,935
- your date, Nazh...
- galia.

78
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,444
- Hello, my God!
- Well, Shannon wouldn't go out
without a chaperone...

79
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:20,810
- Right.
- and so she's your date.

80
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,713
<i>It was clear that Gob wasn't</i>
<i>offering an olive branch at all...</i>

81
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:27,015
<i>and, in fact, was still</i>
<i>harboring some resentment over Marta.</i>

82
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:30,784
Oh...
"Nagarma," you've got a mustache.
- Hey!

83
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:33,519
- I mean, you've got milk on your mustache.
- Oh.

84
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,527
- I mean, you've got a milk mustache.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:39,998
It's adorable. You look like
one of those "Got Milk" models.

86
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,365
<i>But Gob mistook Michael's</i>
<i>basic human decency for romantic interest...</i>

87
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,701
<i>and felt a competitive urge to step in.</i>

88
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:51,301
Because, you know,
it's beyond adorable... and e-exotic.

89
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:55,314
- I find you very attractive.
- Really?

90
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,714
<i>And George Sr.</i>
<i>was about to get a surprise visitor.</i>

91
00:04:57,818 --> 00:05:01,584
Mr. Bluth?
I'm Cindi Lightballoon.

92
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:06,217
I've studied all your teachings,
and I've purchased every tape.

93
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,818
And I watch 'em over and over.

94
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:12,592
<i>George Sr. had recently marketed</i>
<i>a line of self-help tapes...</i>

95
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,168
<i>touting his newly discovered spirituality.</i>

96
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:18,670
I've also lost four pounds on your low-carb
Bluth Banana Jail Bars.

97
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:25,502
I've come to learn at your feet.

98
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:30,183
That's a good place to start.

99
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:36,386
<i>And Michael, free ofhis double</i>
<i>date, met Lindsay at Parent-Teacher Night.</i>

100
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,390
<i>Hey, Linds, is it my imagination...</i>

101
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:41,017
or does this rape room have
the same floor plan as our kitchen?

102
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:43,528
Did you meet Ms. Baerly yet,
the ethics teacher? 'Cause I just did.

103
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:46,065
No, not yet.
Look, these are our cabinets.

104
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,566
Yeah. Well, I think
she's perfect for you.

105
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,569
- For me? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,866
Thanks, but no. I've already been set up
once today by a sibling...

107
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,032
and I don't think
you people know my type.

108
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:58,009
Hey, look. It's not coming from me.
It's-It's George Michael.

109
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:01,548
He told me.
I think he wants a mother.

110
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,708
Well, that's ridiculous.
He's got you. He's got <i>our</i> mother.

111
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,785
You'd think that would turn
him off to the entire concept.

112
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:10,414
Besides, I'm not gonna rush out
and marry somebody just because
you think my son would like it.

113
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,751
Welcome. I'm Ms. Baerly,
the ethics teacher.

114
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:18,855
<i>My goal is to teach your children</i>
<i>about the preciousness oflife...</i>

115
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,901
that can be lost
by the mindless pulling of a trigger.

116
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:25,904
Mmm. No ring.

117
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:32,708
<i>And so Michael got to know</i>
<i>his son's ethics teacher.</i>

118
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,804
Ethics... right and wrong.

119
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:37,645
How can one thing can be right
and another one be wrong?

120
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,549
I mean, which is which, you know?

121
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:43,054
I guess that's the "Rrrr" of it.

122
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:45,057
You know, so frustrating.

123
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,492
I don't know. I mean, they just threw this class
at me after Mr. Daniels had a stroke.

124
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,996
I had him, Mr. Daniels.
How is he?

125
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,297
- Oh, he, you know, had a stroke.
- Oh.

126
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:59,429
- Thought you were joking.
- No, I was just laughing 'cause you were laughing.

127
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,441
- Right. No. Yeah. Gosh. Hmm.
- Yeah.

128
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:04,841
- "Rrrr!"
- "Rrrr!"

129
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:07,607
- <i>But, you know, l-l</i>... <i>I really</i>
<i>am antiwar and antiviolence.</i>
- Uh-huh.

130
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,774
- And I think I'm an ethical person.
- Right.

131
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,851
Here's an ethical question.

132
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:16,685
Can-Can a parent take a teacher out
for a drink? Or...

133
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:20,352
I don't know.
Uh, do you have a wife?

134
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:23,362
- Yeah. But she's dead.
- Oh.

135
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,860
Have you ever been married?

136
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,199
Yeah, she died.

137
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:34,103
Ohh.
God, why are we laughing?

138
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,199
I don't...
Well, it's the Mr. Daniels stroke thing...

139
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,540
all over again.

140
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,704
- Let's go get that drink.
- Yeah, it could only help.

141
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,647
- Rrrr!
- Rrr!

142
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:47,915
<i>George Sr. was dealing</i>
<i>with his own admirer.</i>

143
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:51,685
Oh, I've already told
you so many of my sins.

144
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,953
Maybe you could
tell me some of yours.

145
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,552
Uh, well, there are
legal implications to that.

146
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:59,723
But, uh, back to your sins.
Uh, do that one about the, uh...

147
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,097
ladies' shower...

148
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,397
in your college dorm again.

149
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:08,933
<i>And Michael was on his way</i>
<i>to what would be his second date...</i>

150
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,977
<i>with Ms. Baerly.</i>

151
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:13,171
Michael, the little Korean is here,
and I don't know what to do with him.

152
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,248
At least, I think it's a him.

153
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,977
You've got to strip them down to next
to nothing before you can even tell.

154
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,679
Yeah, Mom.
I just spoke to Social Services...

155
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,949
and although
they don't like to do this...

156
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,116
if you can prove that
it's a bad environment for a child...

157
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:29,093
and I would suggest saying what you
just said to me, don't change a word...

158
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:33,462
- they will take him back.
- Ha, ha, ha. Uh, don't get too comfortable.

159
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,434
<i>Shoes on, mister! Shoes on!</i>

160
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,437
He's out of control.

161
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,439
Hold on.

162
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:46,278
I'm back.

163
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:49,440
Who's that?

164
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,951
This is "Annyong,"
who your father and I have adopted.

165
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:56,113
What, I'm gone for a couple days
and you find a new son?

166
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:59,784
<i>Lucille could see that</i>
<i>her son was concerned, even jealous.</i>

167
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:02,293
<i>And she knew how it felt</i>
<i>to be overlooked.</i>

168
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:06,230
Yes. Annyong is your brother now.

169
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,962
Yes, Annyong.
Excuse me. Oh, Michael?

170
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,300
Call it off.

171
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:14,897
I'm keeping him.

172
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,442
- Look, I gotta call you back.
- Sweet ride.

173
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:20,012
Are you making
dinner reservations?

174
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,480
No, no.
That was my Mom. She just had...

175
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,677
- a "little Korean" dropped off.
- Ooh, that sounds good. Let's have that.

176
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,223
- Hello.
- <i>And after their date...</i>

177
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:37,354
<i>Michael took a step</i>
<i>he hadn't taken in years.</i>

178
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:40,592
Okay, do you think this is a good idea?

179
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,635
I think it's a great idea.

180
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:46,231
Mmm.

181
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,240
Such a good idea.

182
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,243
But how are we going to sneak in
without waking everyone up?

183
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:53,506
We'll take the stairs.

184
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:59,208
This may not have been
my best idea.

185
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,054
I'm sorry, Michael.

186
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:14,959
I'm sorry too, Michael,
but it looks like we're even.

187
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:19,368
You took something I liked.
I took something you liked.

188
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:22,874
Yeah.
l... ... "Nashbagerlajam."

189
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:26,377
Listen, I know that you've been
trying to get even with me about Marta.

190
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,210
But got bad news for ya.
I'm seeing somebody else.

191
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,876
Who? Who?

192
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:35,284
just out of curiosity... I'm not
gonna try to sleep with her.

193
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,381
- Forget it. I thought that this was behind us.
- It is behind us.

194
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:41,757
- <i>Great.</i>
- When I sleep with her.
'Cause I'm gonna sleep with her.

195
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,057
Yeah. I was lying when I said
I wasn't gonna to sleep with her, so...

196
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:46,860
- She'd have to agree to it.
- I don't anticipate a problem with that.

197
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:49,765
- No?
- No. 'Cause I've seen some of the dogs you like.

198
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,394
- Right.
- I just slept with one.

199
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:54,474
- Again, didn't like Nazhgalia.
- Really.

200
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,839
- Really, and good luck getting rid of her.
- Oh, please.

201
00:10:56,944 --> 00:11:00,402
Not a problem. She knows it was
a one-time thing. Totally cool.

202
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:05,474
- Oh, so romantic.
- Who's "N. Bahn-Ahden?"

203
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,747
Hello.

204
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:10,322
<i>Hey, George Michael.</i>

205
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:13,916
I wanted to talk to you about something
before, but I didn't know if it was real.

206
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:16,257
But now, uh...

207
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:18,490
your ethics teacher...

208
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,692
- Yeah, I just made this for her.
- Oh.

209
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,099
She loves Saddam Hussein.

210
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:26,604
I'm sure she doesn't love Saddam.
I'm sure she is interested in him...

211
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:29,198
as a subject, you know.

212
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,403
- Right. That's what I meant.
- Great.

213
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:35,276
You know, I just wanted to make her
something special to show that I care.

214
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:38,351
- About the class?
- No. I mean, about her.

215
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:41,717
- Oh!
- I kind of love her.

216
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:45,121
You mean, you love her like...
like she loves Saddam.

217
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,888
- Right?
- No, no. I mean, like, <i>love her</i> love her.

218
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:51,464
Oh.

219
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:54,466
- Oh.
- Oh, hi!

220
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:57,628
Hi, George Michael. I was just...

221
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,672
Iooking at this model home.

222
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,832
I'm gonna go home
and think about it.

223
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,933
I'm gonna go home,
think about it.

224
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,837
Dad, what was she doing here?

225
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:10,473
I mean, sh... she wasn't...

226
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:15,647
<i>Michael knew he had an ethical</i>
<i>responsibility to tell his son the truth.</i>

227
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,281
Yes.

228
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,190
Your Uncle Gob slept with her.

229
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:30,302
Well, why would he do that? Why
would Gob sleep with my ethics teacher?

230
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:33,373
- Probably to get even with me.
- How would that be getting even with you?

231
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:36,806
- I'm the one that likes her.
- Right. Right.

232
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,810
No, I know.
You and I know that, but Gob he just...

233
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:43,246
He's not that exact of a target shooter,
and he just kind of sprays it everywhere.

234
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,047
You know, but listen, did-did you really
think that-that... that you had a...

235
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:49,418
I mean, she's kinda
old for you, don't you think?

236
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:51,684
We don't even know how old she is.
No one does.

237
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,885
She was chaperoning
the diversity dance...

238
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:56,656
and I thought maybe as a joke,
I'd go up to her and be, like...

239
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:58,788
"Well, hey, do you want to dance?"

240
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,333
And she'd be, like, "Ah, what the heck?"
Right? Or some... I don't know.

241
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,562
- I did it differently in the mirror, but...
- Right.

242
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,661
- But, you know, like, we'd be
joke dancing or something.
- <i>I get it.</i>

243
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:09,640
- I didn't think it through.
- Don't you think you should be
taking somebody your own age?

244
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:11,677
Like your cousin.

245
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:14,645
- That's a bad example, but...
- I feel so stupid.

246
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:18,878
I defaced a rare book to get that picture
of Saddam Hussein in a bathing suit.

247
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,521
- <i>"What would Saddam do?"</i>
- Yeah.

248
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:25,352
Yeah, you know something?
You're right. Gob's gonna pay.

249
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,263
Okay,
that is our exact outdoor fire pit.

250
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:37,861
<i>At prison, George Sr. was preparing</i>
<i>for an evening with his most devoted fan.</i>

251
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:41,429
<i>While Cindi Lightballoon was</i>
<i>making preparations ofher own.</i>

252
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,441
- How we doin'?
- <i>We have video.</i>

253
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:48,378
- Testing one, two.
- Tilt back a little, will you, Harris?

254
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:51,110
Let's bust this guy.

255
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:54,051
<i>So George Michael, still angry at Gob...</i>

256
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:56,452
<i>sought out the family expert</i>
<i>on making trouble.</i>

257
00:13:56,556 --> 00:14:00,083
- I know he was dating that girl Shannon.
- The cheerleader?

258
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:03,060
Yeah, she's probably gonna take him
to that stupid diversity dance.

259
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:05,222
I wish I had someone shocking to take.

260
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:07,800
You know, I actually called
Mr. Daniels and asked him...

261
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:11,428
but he got all out of breath
and dropped the phone.

262
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,939
- I never heard back.
- You know, may-maybe
we should go together.

263
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:19,171
<i>Right, I mean, it's a bad example</i>...
<i>l</i>... <i>But should we?</i>

264
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,179
Hello.

265
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,476
Yes, Annyong.
Your name's Annyong.

266
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,143
We all know you're Annyong.
Annyong. Annyong. Annyong.

267
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:29,484
- Who's this?
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Annyong.

268
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,251
My mom bought him.
She's making me register him for school.

269
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:36,295
- He's my new little brother.
- So we're related.

270
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:41,299
- Hey, wanna go to a dance?
- Oh, great, another uncle to compete with.

271
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:44,700
<i>And Michael went to discuss</i>
<i>the George Michael situation with Ms. Baerly.</i>

272
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:47,296
<i>Being held against their will...</i>

273
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:52,037
purely on the basis of political
or religious beliefs.

274
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:55,603
I'm sorry.
I met someone. I'm sorry.

275
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:59,811
<i>Anyway, this is serious.</i>
<i>This is atrocities. No more smiling.</i>

276
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,946
Michael! Uh, just a minute.

277
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:07,458
- Hi. Sorry...
- Hi!

278
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:09,825
Don't worry. George Michael's
not in there. Those are the dumb kids.

279
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,160
Okay.
Um, listen.

280
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:14,529
- This is uh...
- Wow! Did you make this for me?

281
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,693
This is so sweet.
I love Hussein.

282
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:20,739
- You mean, you're interested in him.
- Oh, yes. He is a monster.

283
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,571
- Yeah.
- Wow. Where did you find
this one of him in a Speedo?

284
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,168
This is what I want to talk to you
about, though. Um, Beth...

285
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,679
I don't think that
I can continue to see you.

286
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:33,514
But I've enjoyed
my time with you.

287
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,852
- You ever wanna talk ethics...
- You really mean it? This isn't
one of"my wife died"jokes?

288
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,223
- No, I'm afraid this is serious.
- Oh.

289
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,319
You see, George Michael
made this poster for you.

290
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,366
You know, he-he kind of, uh,
is in love with you, so...

291
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,994
- He knows we're going out.
He saw me this morning.
- No, I covered that.

292
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:53,402
I told him that you
slept with my brother.

293
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:56,670
That may be the most
unethical thing I've ever heard.

294
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:59,404
Well, you've only been
doing this half a semester.

295
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:04,143
Look, it was a preemptive strike.
My brother would've tried to sleep with you.

296
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,651
- Well, I want you to leave
right now and not come back.
- Right. I know.

297
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:10,348
I understand. I'm sorry.
And you will not see me again.

298
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:19,098
Starting right now.

299
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,793
<i>George Sr. went on a walk</i>
<i>with Cindi.</i>
- George.

300
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:26,464
- <i>And she was getting to him.</i>
- You can feel safe to fully reveal yourself to me.

301
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:29,872
Hmm, all right.
There is...

302
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:33,639
- There is something.
- Come closer.

303
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:38,116
It's weighing heavy on my soul.

304
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:43,383
You, uh... You know, the Talmud teaches
us to... There you go.

305
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,390
- What's he doing?
- He's pinching the camera.

306
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,392
He's on to us.
He's found the camera.

307
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:49,587
- Get out of there. He's got the camera.
Abort! Abort!
- Get the dog.

308
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,789
Clean the dog.
We are cleaning the dog!

309

<i>That night, Buster</i>

- Whoa, sorry. Students only.
- Oh.

316
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:35,206
So you're not letting him in because he
doesn't share your perfectly shaped nose...

317
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:38,971
your round eye-shaped eyes,
your strong square jaw.

318
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,445
Thanks.
You wanna dance?

319
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:43,516
- Yeah!
- All right!

320
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:46,108
Steve Holt!

321
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,551
<i>And Gob sought out Shannon</i>...
- <i>Shannon!</i>

322
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:51,385
<i>who had found out he had</i>
<i>cheated on her with Nazhgalia.</i>

323
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:54,756
Shannon, where are you?
Shannon!

324
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:57,887
Oh, hey, Lisa.
Shannon!

325
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:01,264
Excuse me.
Look, I blew it, okay?

326
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:04,360
But I bought a yearbook ad from you.
Doesn't that mean anything anymore?

327
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:08,373
<i>Beth! Hey, hi.</i>
<i>Listen...</i>

328
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:11,638
Um, I blew it okay?
I had to see you.

329
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,804
l-I've been giving this
a lot of thought, and-and...

330
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:17,349
- I have to do the right thing.
- You're gonna tell George Michael the truth?

331
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,078
Oh, that's... that's your
definition of the right thing.

332
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:23,747
I thought I was gonna make
a dramatic entrance and tell you
that I wanted to see you. Okay.

333
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:26,223
Uh, I'll get right on that.

334
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:29,659
George Michael!
Where are you? George Michael!

335
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,891
- Uncle Gob?
- George Michael.

336
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:35,229
- What are you doing at a high school dance?
- I'm looking for you.

337
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,895
- How could you do this to me?
- Do what?

338
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,165
- I'm just here with my girl.
- Yeah, my ethics teacher.

339
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:42,673
- <i>Hey, George Michael.</i>
- No, Dad. I'm taking care of something, okay?

340
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,334
- All right.
- You slept with my ethics teacher.

341
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,344
Just hang on a second.

342
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:47,380
- It wasn't him. It's me, okay?
- Wha...

343
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,904
- It wasn't him. It's me, okay?
- Wha...

344
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:52,507
- I've been dating your ethics teacher.
- Wow, Michael.

345
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,417
I'm really touched that you'd stick up
for me after I've been so horrible to you.

346
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:59,288
- Huh?
- You know what? Now it's time
for me to do the right thing.

347
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,528
I slept with the ethics teacher.
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:06,463
- What are you talking about?
- Lindsay told me that you liked
her and I'm not proud of this...

349
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:09,899
but... l...
Mrs. Whitehead.

350
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:12,870
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>Gob mistook the civics teacher...</i>

351
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:15,202
<i>for the ethics teacher Michael was dating.</i>

352
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:18,368
Man, he... has a type.

353
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:22,039
<i>Gob, Mrs. Whitehead</i>
<i>was the</i> civics <i>teacher.</i>

354
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:25,777
- We both had her.
- Yes, we have. And now we're even.

355
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:27,944
- What a pig.
- Tell me about it.

356
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,284
No, you!
You're the pig!

357
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,154
- Two strikes. You are out.
- Listen. Shannon, please.

358
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,693
It was a onetime thing. I'm not
gonna hear from her again!

359
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,820
Ach!

360
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:42,129
Who is Edna W? Hello?

361
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:45,227
- What's going on here, Dad?
- Well, it-it-it was me, okay?

362
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,671
l-I've been seeing Ms. Baerly, and I
should never have brought Gob into it.

363
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:51,608
But that day you told me you liked her,
I didn't know what else to do.

364
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:54,737
- I never wanted to hurt you.
- Didn't Aunt Lindsay tell you I liked her?

365
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:58,306
Yeah. But she said that you wanted her as
a mother, and I said that was ridiculous...

366
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:00,579
but then I met her
and kind of fell for her...

367
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:03,679
and thought that she would
kind of make a great mother.

368
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,317
<i>Is that true? I didn't</i>
<i>know you were that serious.</i>

369
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,918
Well, you know, I'm open to it.
We're open to it.

370
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,463
Wow!

371
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:16,331
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm just saying someday, you know.

372
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:19,872
- I'm not really into kids.
- I'm just... I'm not trying to rush anything.

373
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,998
Hey!
The lady said no, man.

374
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,576
Look, Michael,
I hope you find what you're looking for.

375
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:27,771
I mean we had some laughs about
some very sad things, but...

376
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:30,509
I don't think we have a future.

377
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:35,812
- And, Jeremy, I will take that cupcake.
- Ohh. Okay, um...

378
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:41,652
- Hey, uh, you wanna dance?
- Sure, why not?

379
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,555
I can't believe that would have worked.

380
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,392
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

381
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,629
<i>Buster's competition</i>
<i>heats up.</i>

382
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:54,639
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We are not</i>
<i>allowed to have candles in here.</i>

383
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:57,209
- Mom would freak.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

384
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:02,646
This is America, baby.
You pray how you want.

385
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:05,377
I'll light a candle
of my own.

386
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:07,476
That's exactly
what I'll do.

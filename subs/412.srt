NARRATOR:<i>High school seniors</i>
<i>often find themselves</i>

3
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:15,858
<i>in their first relationship.</i>

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,943
How was that?

5
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:18,194
Perfecto.

6
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:20,196
NARRATOR:
<i>This is Maeby Funke,</i>

7
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:23,741
<i>and during her senior year,</i>
<i>she was dating this boy.</i>

8
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,785
<i>His name was Perfecto Telles,</i>

9
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:28,579
<i>and she was rewarding him</i>
<i>for doing her English homework,</i>

10
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:31,874
<i>even though English was</i>
<i>his second language.</i>

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,460
And if you do my Spanish,
I'll teach you how to French.

12
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:37,672
<i>Everyone could see that</i>
<i>they had chemistry together,</i>

13
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,381
<i>but it wasn't until</i>
<i>Donny Richter's algebra class</i>

14
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:40,883
<i>that the real bonding began.</i>

15
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:43,011
Okay, I don't want
to embarrass anyone,

16
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:45,054
so, everyone, close your eyes,
close 'em.

17
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:48,808
Now, if you passed the test,
go ahead and get up

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,226
and exit the classroom.

- Oh, 43,

22
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,483
but that's because
I'm good with numb...

23
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,235
Oh, no, actually it's 34.

24
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,862
Well, if it's dumb
to stay behind

We don't say "dummy,"

you two alge-tards

(chuckles)

52
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,916
But, wait, why are you
in high school?

53
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,543
Didn't we graduate together
five years ago?

54
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,128
<i>It was a decent question.</i>

55
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,756
<i>After all,</i>
<i>it had been several years</i>

56
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:03,465
<i>since the two high school</i>
<i>seniors got somewhat intimate.</i>

57
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:06,135
You might not even be
related to us.

58
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:10,056
<i>But later,</i>
<i>while fleeing the boat party,</i>

59
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,142
<i>George Michael got some advice</i>
<i>on the matter from his father.</i>

60
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,685
She might not be
a blood relative,

61
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,854
but she is still family.

62
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:21,776
<i>So, after returning, worn from</i>
<i>the harsh winds of the sea,</i>

63
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:23,278
<i>George Michael found the girl</i>

64
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,113
<i>he now had to back away from</i>
<i>on her back.</i>

65
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,656
- Maeby, are you okay?
What are you doing? - Shh-shh.

66
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:29,992
I'm trying to get my parents
to notice me.

67
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:32,370
- I've been here for, like, an
hour and a half. - It's not me.

68
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:34,247
<i>- It had been seven minutes.</i>
- Do you think it would help

69
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:37,041
if I went over and said, like,
"Hey, Maeby's dead"?

70
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,043
- No, that would just mean
that they notice you. - Well,

71
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,129
obviously they've just got
a lot on their plate right now.

72
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,880

76
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,513

00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,474
There's nothing

79
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,769
TOBIAS: I believe
we're thinking the same thing.

80
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,980
- Oh, God.
- (sighs)

81
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,315
But, you know, I'm actually--

82
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:02,442
I'm glad to have
a moment alone with you,

83
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,819
because it gives us a chance
to talk about us.

84
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,528
You know, I really care
about you.

85
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,739
Oh, boy, here we go.

86
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,241
You want to get more serious.

87
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:12,452
<i>And Maeby didn't, because--</i>

88
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,494
<i>and I never</i>
<i>told you this, but--</i>

89
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:17,539
<i>George Michael wasn't</i>
<i>a very good kisser.</i>

90
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:19,292
<i>It seems</i>
<i>he both used his tongue</i>

91
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:21,377
<i>to fend off</i>
<i>the intruding tongue,</i>

92
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,339
<i>but also laterally moved</i>
<i>his lower jaw</i>

93
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,548
<i>while constricting</i>
<i>his lower lip.</i>

94
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,093
<i>The upper lip, meanwhile,</i>
<i>tended to retract,</i>

95
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,930
<i>revealing an exposed area from</i>
<i>the front teeth to the canines,</i>

96
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:36,767
<i>ultimately creating</i>
<i>more pain than pleasure.</i>

97
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,394
<i>Really just rookie mistakes,</i>

98
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:41,230
<i>but all of it conspired</i>
<i>to make Maeby concerned</i>

99
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,649
<i>about him wanting</i>
<i>to get more serious.</i>

100
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,110
- No, less serious.
- What?

101
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,321
Well, my dad doesn't think
that it's such a good idea

102
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,323
for you and me to be together.

103
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,533
And that doesn't make me
hotter to you?

104
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:54,952
No, I could see
that argument, I-I...

105
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:56,454
No, I think we should
just be cousins.

106
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,873
So first my parents don't notice
that I drowned,

107
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,333
and now my cousin doesn't care

108
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,211
that I'm at the height
of my sexuality.

109
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:06,088
No, sure I care, and, you know,
I'm right there with you.

110
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,508
We're a couple of, uh,
forces of nature, but...

111
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,010
- What?
- Forces of nature.

112
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,804
But I just really need to focus
on graduating right now,

113
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:16,516
and maybe you should, too,
you know.

114
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,893
Maybe that's the best way to get
your parents' attention.

115
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,270
That's a great idea.

116
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,939
I've got two whole months
to flunk.

117
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,774
That's got to disappoint them.

NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

119
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:30,029
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

120
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,490
<i>and the one daughter</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

<i>but to keep her life together.</i>

122
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,790
<i>It's Maeby's</i>
"Arrested Development."

00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,586
<i>Maeby was trying</i>
<i>to get her parents</i>

124
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,671
<i>to notice she was flunking...</i>

125
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:50,174
So, for some reason they didn't
send me a cap and gown,

126
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,134
and I was gonna make one
out of sheets,

127
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,011
but I couldn't find...

128
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:56,556
<i>...only to discover</i>
<i>that Maeby's graduation wasn't</i>

<i>top-of-mind for her parents.</i>

130
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,641
They left town.

131
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:04,230
<i>So she put her plan to put her</i>
<i>graduation on hold on hold...</i>

132
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,732
- No, we do not need any extras.
<i>- ...and headed off to India,</i>

133
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,776
<i>where she'd be working</i>
<i>at what was once</i>

134
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,403
<i>just her after-school job.</i>

135
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,448
Right. Okay, do we have
to pay them in money or in rice?

136
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:16,617
If they're in the union,
you have to pay with rice.

137
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:18,578
<i>The movie she was supervising</i>
<i>was the latest</i>

138

<i>"Gangie" franchise,</i>
<i>this one taking place in India.</i>

140
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,419
All right, I say we get
10,000 extras,

141
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:28,337
- and then that way we have it.
- We have it.

142
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,172
- Yeah, we have it.
- It's good to have it.

wearing this back home.

144
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:33,342
You'd think
someone would tell her

145
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:34,760
to shave her arms,
the poor thing.

146
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,053

MAEBY:

150
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,767

LINDSAY:
You don't get it.

154
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,984
I'm not used

155
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:53,362
No, you don't get it--

156
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:56,407
Oh, you have got to be
kidding me.

157
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,576
Do we have a hair
and makeup crew with us?

158
00:05:58,618 --> 00:05:59,910
Pretty makeup or scary makeup?

159
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,412
Scary.

160
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:03,289
Well, I think we have
the crew that did

Yeah, yeah.

Pull your head out of the sand.

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,596
Love is where you left it.

00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,640
The only person back home
is Tobias.

170
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,267
You have no children?

171
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,144
No. Why do you ask?

172
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,146
Well, yes, a daughter.

173
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,689
She's away at boarding school
in England.

174
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,610
- Is that where we left it?
<i>- Although you'd think this</i>

175
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:33,902
<i>- would have given her away.</i>
- Hug?

176
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:37,156
Please don't squeeze the shaman.

177
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,492
<i>And while it did bring</i>
<i>the family back together...</i>

178
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:40,826
Stop with the prayer hands.

179
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,495
It just looks like
you're out of ideas.

180
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:44,830
<i>...it did make it harder</i>
<i>for Maeby to make</i>

181
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,499
<i>this insult stick.</i>

182
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,292
Don't you think it makes
you seem a little, um,

183
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:51,753
what is that saying,
full of (bleep)?

184
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:54,340
Thank you, Maeby, that's
actually a compliment in India.

185
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,425
- My own fault. - I'm here
because a shaman told me

186
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,718
that love is where I left it.

187
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,805
<i>But soon, the Funkes took</i>
<i>their new spirit of love</i>

188
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:04,475
<i>and togetherness into a place</i>
<i>where they would seldom run</i>

189
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,602
<i>into each other,</i>
<i>and Maeby enrolled...</i>

190
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,646
- Okay, going back to school.
<i>- ...in a new high school</i>

191
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,939
<i>- for her senior year...</i>
- Senior year!

192
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,316
No? No one cares?

193
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:15,611
This is usually
a tough time for teens.

194
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:18,030
This is when drugs
often become an issue.

195
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,990
<i>...to see if her parents</i>
<i>would notice</i>

196
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:21,783
<i>she should have</i>
<i>already graduated.</i>

197
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,327
Time for babies having babies!

198
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:25,454
Is "Babies Having Babies" on?

199
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,583
That's my favorite show. Ow.

200
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,836
Mother's Day Eve was the most
joyous day of the year.

201
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:35,715
Maeby, you're going
to be late for school.

202
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,217
<i>And although they did share</i>
<i>one Thanksgiving together...</i>

203
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,553
It's not on.

204
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,221
<i>...they didn't realize</i>
<i>they were doing so...</i>

205
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,056
Why would they preempt
"Babies Having Babies"

206
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,600
for a turkey cartoon?

207
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:48,519
<i>...having celebrated it</i>
<i>one week earlier</i>

208
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,605
<i>when they found that duck</i>
<i>in the cupboard,</i>

209
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,940
<i>tried to cook it alive,</i>
<i>got scared, and then</i>

210
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:55,025
<i>ended up eating it</i>
<i>at a Chinese restaurant.</i>

211
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,818
WOMAN:<i>Okay, yeah,</i>
<i>we cook duck for you.</i>

212
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,739
<i>Nonetheless, Maeby was</i>
<i>doing well in school</i>

213
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:01,532
<i>and might have graduated</i>
<i>had this not happened.</i>

214
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:04,243
LINDSAY (over machine):
Look, I'm sorry, Tobias,

215
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,827
but we're trying
to save something

216
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,996
that just couldn't be saved.

217
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,207
Can you delete this so I can
leave a message for Maeby?

218
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,209
TOBIAS (over machine):
Lindsay, I have met someone.

219
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,336
It's not important who it is.

220
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,797
Erase this message,
and I'll leave her a mess...

221
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:21,510
LINDSAY: Maeby, honey, Daddy has
insisted on raising you alone.

222
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:23,845
<i>But at least</i>
<i>her father was choked up.</i>

223
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,598
TOBIAS (voice breaking):
Maeby, your daddy's

224
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,475
not going to be around anymore.

225
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:28,934
(sighs)

226
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,561
(normal voice): Excuse me,
I swallowed a bug there.

227
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,104
Uh, your daddy's not going
to be around anymore.

228
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,855
WOMAN (over machine):
This is the Widow Carr,

229
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:35,941
and for some reason,
it's my job to tell you that,

230
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,736
since you never made payment,
your house is being foreclosed.

231
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:40,112
Also, Tobias, you got a callback

232
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,322
for something called
"The Big Bang Theory."

233
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,157
<i>Having lost her parents</i>

234
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:46,827
<i>and her house, Maeby stopped</i>
<i>bothering with high school,</i>

235
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:49,705
<i>skipped her grandmother's</i>
<i>trial, and headed to L.A.</i>

236
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,750
<i>She now had to make sure</i>
<i>that she had an income.</i>

237
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,460
- Guess what. I'll just tell you.
- What?

238
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:56,253
- Yeah. - 'Cause I feel
like we'll be here forever,

239
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,464
and I have a meeting.
Um, you're fired.

240
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,841
- Why? - Well, because you don't
have a high school diploma,

241
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,635
and we have
a very strict policy here

242
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:04,845
that everyone has to have a
high school diploma, on account

243
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:07,055
of the fact
that Ron never graduated.

244
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,390
- Is this really happening?
- Actually, I was thinking

245
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:09,975
I wasn't even gonna
have to fire you

246
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,060
'cause it's been
on Deadline all day.

247
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:13,395
MAEBY:
<i>How did they find out?</i>

248
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:14,480
KITTY:
<i>Does it even matter anymore?</i>

249
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:15,523
MAEBY:
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

250
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:16,816
I told them.

251
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,359
NARRATOR:
<i>With no parents, no job,</i>

252
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,944
<i>and no place to live,</i>
<i>Maeby had squat,</i>

253
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,530
<i>which is exactly what</i>
<i>she decided to do...</i>

254
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,031
What?

255
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:25,449
<i>...at her</i>
<i>grandparents' penthouse.</i>

256
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,075
<i>And that's when Maeby did</i>

257
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,410
<i>what we</i>
<i>in the entertainment industry</i>

258
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,413
<i>- call "deadlining."</i>
- Come on.

259
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,374
- (ostrich clucking)
- LINDSAY: What do you think?

260
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,376
<i>On the plus side,</i>
<i>each parent thought</i>

261
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,127
<i>- she was with the other.</i>
- And we're not moving in;

262
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,587
we're occupying a space
with central air.

263
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:40,214
<i>So Maeby was as free</i>
<i>as that bird.</i>

264
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:41,173
(bleep)!

265
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,718
MARKY:
Cindy, you okay?

266
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,511
All right, this will be
where she goes.

267
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,055
<i>So she retreated to</i>
<i>the long abandoned model home,</i>

268
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:51,767
<i>where she discovered</i>
<i>it's a lot harder to get out</i>

269
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:55,062
<i>of a Bluth home than into one.</i>

270
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,481
Pieces of (bleep).

271
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,107
<i>And maybe it was because</i>

272
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,443
<i>she had never fully</i>
<i>disappointed her parents,</i>

273
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:05,197
<i>and they were getting older,</i>
<i>or perhaps it was because</i>

274
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,574
<i>there was no Internet</i>
<i>at the model home...</i>

275
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:09,744
That is it-- this is like
living in 1999.

276
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:11,787
<i>...but that's when Maeby became</i>
<i>a high school senior</i>

277
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,583
<i>for the third time,</i>
<i>and then a fourth,</i>

278
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:18,669
<i>and then it just</i>
<i>sort of became what she did.</i>

279
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:22,172
<i>And it ultimately led to this.</i>

280
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:24,299
So I'm still going to stay
in high school

281
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,676
until they notice me.

282
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,094
You know, just, like,
let them think,

283
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,345
"Oh, no, should we be worried?

284
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:29,971
- Is she really that immature?"
- Yeah.

285
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,807
Well, I mean, isn't it, uh,

286
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,434
kind of a little immature

287
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:36,604
to try and make
your parents worry like that?

288
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,564
Oh, that's good-- I'm gonna try
and work that in there.

289
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,065
Yeah-- no, I think
it's in there.

290
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,734
Yeah, well,
let's get you in here before

291
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,318
our-our third roommate shows up.
That's Paul Haun.

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,446
Hi. So there's three people
who live in here?

293
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,448
Yeah, well, one guy
is just kind of crashing here.

294
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:50,492
- Well, it can't be worse than
living with your dad. - It's not.

295
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,119
No, it's not worse than that.

296
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,829
<i>And later,</i>

297
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:55,122
<i>- she was joined by her uncle.</i>
- Hello.

298
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,374
Didn't say it was your cousin.

299
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,461
Now, that's smart, let him think
there's a girl in here.

300
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:01,879
Yeah, we were just complaining
about roommates.

301
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,672
(groans, sputters)
P-Hound.

302
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,633
- (George Michael chuckles)
- I thought it was the other one.

303
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,718
No, it-it was P-Hound, yeah.

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,721
He's the worst. See, I think if
George Michael and I didn't have

305
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,890
each other as roommates,
we'd be going crazy.

306
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:17,018
<i>And for a moment, Maeby felt</i>
<i>superior to her cousin--</i>

307
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,104
<i>- and her uncle for that matter.</i>
- Actually,

308
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,856
have you told her
about your software?

309
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:21,941
No, software?

310
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,109
He's got this privacy software.

311
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,569
Keeps people from stealing
your stuff-- tell her, pal.

312
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,572
<i>Maeby tried</i>
<i>to hide her jealousy.</i>

313
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,325
So it's privacy software
that's also antipiracy?

314
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,910
Do you have a way of doing this?

315
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,663
Well, it's just a Boolean-driven
aggregation, really,

316
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,832
of what programmers call
"hacker-traps..."

317
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:40,041
<i>But as she listened</i>
<i>to her cousin discuss</i>

318
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,712
<i>computer technology</i>
<i>she had no understanding of,</i>

319
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:47,174
<i>she lost that feeling</i>
<i>of superiority,</i>

320
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:48,717
<i>and her self-esteem plummeted</i>

321
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,886
<i>as she started</i>
<i>to question the entirety</i>

322
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,054
<i>of what she had done</i>
<i>with her life</i>

323
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,807
<i>for the last several years.</i>

324
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:58,059
...and they want to steal
your music and copy your movies

325
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:01,104
or-or just look at your photos--
you know, this prevents that.

326
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,607
It just neutralizes that
so it's not even a threat.

327
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,066
It's called Fakeblock.

328
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,652
- Great name.
- Yeah, well, you know, it's

329
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,612
super low-hanging fruit.
Someone's gonna do it.

330
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,280
We're just trying
to be those guys, you know.

331
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,740
I don't understand
a word of it, but it works.

332
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,032
You should see
his Facebook page.

333
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,785
Doesn't have a friend on it.

334
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:16,578
<i>Of course, that last part</i>

335
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,830
<i>had nothing to do with</i>
<i>Fakeblock...</i>

336
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,540
Thank you, Dad.

337
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:23,377
<i>...but it did help</i>
<i>George Michael's self-esteem.</i>

338
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,422
NARRATOR:
<i>Maeby was feeling discouraged</i>

339
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,216
<i>as she got back on the bus</i>
<i>for high school.</i>

340
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:32,135
Hey, you want to get high
with us behind the gym?

341
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,554
Wait, we don't know her.

342
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:35,180
I hear there's an undercover cop
at school.

343
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,765
Can you imagine
what kind of loser pretends

344
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,934
to be in high school
when they're in their 20s?

345
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,394
Well, it's pretty gutsy, right?

346
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,146
I mean, it's better
to take the risk, right?

347
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:45,106
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

348
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,027
BOTH:
Cop.

349
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,403
Hey, how was your tutor?
He's not gonna

350
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,571
take you away from me, is he?

351
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:51,655
Well, not until
his software hits

352
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,532
and he can buy me an apartment.

353
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,074
I'm living in a (bleep)hole.

354
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,451
I hear they're hiring
at Chipotle.

355
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:58,412
<i>And that's when Maeby realized</i>

356
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:01,289
<i>maybe she should have graduated</i>
<i>high school.</i>

357
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,666
Can I get a Macallan 12 neat?

358
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,960
- Water back.
- I.D.?

359
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,546
Actually, can we make it--
uh, marry me--

360
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,797
a Wild Turkey?

361
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,173
I still need to see some I.D.

362
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:12,175
- Right. There you go.
- Thank you.

363
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,969
I'm supposed to believe
you're 17?

364
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,554
Oh, no, sorry.

365
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,598
That's my fake for sneaking
back into high school.

366
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,016
Here we go-- 23.

367
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,768
Oh, you're Maeby.
Well, you can have one,

368
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,352
but you got quite a bar tab.

369
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,147
MAEBY:
I got to graduate.

370
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,025
I mean, I got to start bringing
some cash in, you know.

371
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,902
- Yeah.
- Everyone's just passing me by.

372
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,029
George Michael, Kitty Sanchez.

373
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:33,906
CARTER:
Drinks for the house.

374
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:35,407
- (laughter)
- This guy?

375
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,034
These guys are making
a fortune off that

376
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,702
"To Entrap a Local Predator"
show they're on.

377
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:39,828
TAYLOR:
Were.

378
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,329
Won't let us shoot in Laguna.

379
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,791
Are you guys looking
for a new bait house?

380
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:45,166
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>she made enough money</i>

381
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,335
<i>to at least pay</i>
<i>for her bar tab.</i>

382
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,503
PERFECTO:
Hey, guys.

383
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:50,005
- Hey, Perfecto!
- Hey.

384
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,673
Isn't this guy a little
too young to be in here?

385
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,717
No, no, no, he's with us.

386
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,469
<i>But later, when returning</i>
<i>from the restroom,</i>

387
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,679
<i>- she noticed this.</i>
- BARTENDER: So, you fitting in

388
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,681
- over there at the high school?
- He's a cop.

389
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:00,891
BARTENDER:
They accepting you?

390
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:05,562
<i>And as she returned to the</i>
<i>high school for eighth period,</i>

391
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:08,231
<i>even getting a diploma</i>
<i>seemed to be in jeopardy.</i>

392
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,191
Barry?

393
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,111
Maeby, you scared
the be-(bleep) out of me.

394
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,029
What are you doing here?

395
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,447
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

396
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,156
I go to high school here.

397
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,659
I could answer the same thing.

398
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,201
I was just looking
for something more believable.

399
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,579
Speaking of believable,
I was going to ask you

400
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:23,747
a question about that.

401
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:24,957
Um, can somebody get kicked out

402
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,625
of high school
if they're too old?

403
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,251
I think I was made at a bar.

404
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,838
I know this part of the law
very, very well.

405
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,465
After 21, it is illegal
for you to enroll

406
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,634
in high school
in the state of California.

407
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,970
As a matter of fact,
you cannot even lurk.

408
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,304
(scoffs)
"Lurk."

409
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,681
What, do they got
cameras in the bushes?

410
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,641
Why would they do that?
You can't even

411
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,309
see into the locker rooms
from there.

412
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,854
Okay, so what do I do?
Because the guy who caught me

413
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,814
- goes to school with me.
- Oh, well, that's easy.

414
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:51,859
You get something
incriminating on him.

415
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,111
Call me in the office,
we'll discuss it,

416
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:55,654
and then I can also
keep a record,

417
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,364
you know,
for billing and so forth.

418
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,116
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just keep
a record of it, too,

419
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:00,909
so I can follow up
with my own bill.

420
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:02,536
(laughs):
Oh, very good.

421
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:05,122
You should be the lawyer.
Very good. Pro bono.

422
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,832
<i>Knowing that she could</i>
<i>very well</i>

423
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,333
<i>be kicked out of school,</i>

424
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,794
<i>Maeby went in search</i>
<i>of an overdue check</i>

425
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:12,212
<i>at the penthouse.</i>

426
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,089
<i>And as she was</i>
<i>checking out the mail...</i>

427
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:15,966
- (ostrich squawking)
- Oh, my God!

428
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:19,011
<i>...she ran into an ostrich</i>
<i>in heat</i>

429
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,637
<i>- that was interested</i>
- Here, that way, that way.

430
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,347
<i>in checking out the female.</i>

431
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,558
And she wouldn't even
let me get a cat.

432
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,226
<i>And after freeing the ostrich</i>

433
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:29,479
<i>to eventually find love</i>
<i>on the adjoining balcony,</i>

434
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:33,692
<i>she was back searching for</i>
<i>a long overdue royalty check.</i>

435
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,986
<i>In fact, it had arrived</i>
<i>one day earlier.</i>

436
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:39,656
"From Gangie for facelift"?
Mother.

437
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:42,450
<i>But she did find</i>
<i>that she was being honored</i>

438
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:44,536
<i>at an award show dedicated</i>
<i>to the achievements</i>

439
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,497
<i>of young people</i>
<i>in the entertainment business.</i>

440
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,416
I'm getting an Opie?

441
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:51,459
<i>And it did boost her esteem.</i>

442
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,879
- Hey.
<i>- The only bigger honor</i>

443
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,839
<i>would be having</i>
<i>an award like that</i>

444
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,883
<i>named after you, I guess.</i>

445
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,467
<i>Days later, however,</i>

446
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,762
<i>she was called</i>
<i>to Donny Richter's classroom.</i>

447
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:03,722
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Mm, yeah.

448
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,265
I got you tacos.

449
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:07,350
I hope that's okay,
because you're

450
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,561
going to sit here
through lunch and study.

451
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:10,896
No, I can't. I can't.

452
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,065
Young lady, you better
pull it together

453
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:14,608
or you're not going to graduate.

454
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,693
What is it going to take
to get you to focus?

455
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,945
Are you on drugs?

456
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,446
Because, from what I hear,

457
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:21,531
there might be an undercover cop
at this school.

458
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,324
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was an undercover cop</i>

459
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,619
<i>she was searching</i>
<i>for a way to incriminate.</i>

460
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,412
How long do you want
to stay in high school?

461
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,915
- You're 17.
<i>- And that's when she remembered</i>

462
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,459
<i>that Perfecto thought</i>
<i>she was 17, too.</i>

463
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,045
You know what?
I think I will do better

464
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,547
once I get
a little Mexican in me.

465

NARRATOR:<i>Maeby got her cousin</i>
<i>to drive her to the Opies</i>

466
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,807
<i>so she could impress him</i>
<i>with her achievements.</i>

467
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,976
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

468
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,560
who think they can still
play fifth grade.

469
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:52,187
- Have fun.
- I'll catch up.

470

- Oh, my gosh.

<i>- studio boss, Mort Meyers.</i>
- As I live and breathe.

472

I'm actually getting

00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,486
the lifetime achievement Opie
tonight.

474
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:00,737
I'm very sorry.

475
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,114
- (laughs): Yeah.
- No,

476
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,573
they only give that award away

477
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,117
to somebody after they die or,

478
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,161
even worse,
after your career is dead.

479
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,369
Really?

480
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:09,871
Well, consider yourself lucky.

481
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:12,040
They told you
your career was over.

482
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:14,293
I didn't find out until I was
locked out of my office,

483
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,753
'cause, see,
I passed on "Hunger Games."

484
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:18,964
- Mm. - It wasn't the most
graceful of exits.

485
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:20,799
That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

486
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,301
This is for you.

487
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,427
Thanks, man.

488
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:25,679
<i>No, actually,</i>

489
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,097
the exit was pretty graceful.

490
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:28,682
I think I just remember it
that way

491
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,851
'cause it got dicey
when I was sneaking back in

492
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:32,811
to take a (bleep) on Sid's desk.

<i>But do what I do.</i>

496
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,155
When they kick you out
of the business, save face

497
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,866
by starting
your own Internet company.

498
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,784
We're having
a big announcement today.

499
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:48,910
You started an Internet company?

00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:50,411
It's the real deal.

501
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:52,289
It's a system that automates
provisioning...

502
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:54,291
NARRATOR:<i>And once again,</i>
<i>she found herself with someone</i>

503
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,710
<i>who had not only moved on</i>
<i>with their life,</i>

504
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,171
<i>but done so in ways</i>
<i>she couldn't understand.</i>

505
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,755
...overseas financial
transactions.

506
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:02,841
- It's called Schnoodle.
- Schnoodle?

507
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:05,010
Take a hat;
we got 18,000 of them.

508
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,636
<i>And that's when Maeby</i>
<i>ran into a friend</i>

509
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:08,138
<i>she knew from her days</i>
<i>at Imagine.</i>

510
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,223
Rebel.

511
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:10,724
- Hi. How are you?
- In hell.

512
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:12,309
Ah, I hate the Opies.

513
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,519
But whenever Bryce gets
pregnant, guess who gets a call?

514
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,646
And you're getting the lifetime
achievement award, huh?

515
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,024
You know, I can laugh about it,
I can laugh

516
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,817
because I'm actually
on the upswing.

517
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,485
I was just telling Mort here

518
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:24,612
that I've actually started
my own Internet company.

519
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:25,947
I was just about to tell you.

520
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,282
Well, if you need a name,

521
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:29,492
I'm the guy who came up
with Schnoodle.

522
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,328
- How do we know each other?
- We don't.

523
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,537
That's what it is.

524
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,747
Well, Schnoodle's dead.

525
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:34,831
Fakeblock is the next big thing.

526
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:36,583
It's called Fakeblock.

527
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,126
What's this? You're talking...
talking about Fakeblock?

528
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:39,753
Yes. Your privacy software.

529
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,796
Oh. How does your privacy
software work?

530
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:43,798
- Huh? It's private.
- Yes...

531
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,800
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

532
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,136
- Yes. - I don't want people
to know that I'm doing this.

533
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:49,679
Everybody has to know
about this, okay?

534
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:51,139
This could be big for me.

535
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:53,308
I could make Fakeblock huge.

536
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,352
No, no, Maeby,
there is no company.

537
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:57,229
Fakeblock is just a software
that I'm developing.

538
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:59,522
And the whole point
is that it's private.

539
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,858
So you can't be telling people
about it.

540
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,443
No, we got to tell people
about it.

541
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,237
I just got a lifetime
achievement award.

542
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,780
I'm finished.

543
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:08,282
And also,
I think you should consider

544
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:09,824
calling it "The" Fakeblock.

545
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:11,368
It's cleaner.

546
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,453
- Like "The Netflick."
- It-It's just not ready.

547
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:15,663
Okay, there's still a bunch
of programming problems.

548
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,040
You can get it ready,
George Michael.

549
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,666
What, you think they invite
the animals

550
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,585
and ask them to wait
while they build the zoo?

551
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,754
No, that would be a bloodbath.

552
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,631
Yeah, a total (bleep) bloodbath.

553
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:26,216
We have no money
to start a business.

554
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:27,926
Don't worry,
I'll get the ball rolling

555
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:30,637
with some free publicity
when I accept my award.

556
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:33,014
Come on, this could be
my only chance to be a Harris.

557
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,641
- A Harris?
- All right, fine.

558
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:36,517
You can still be the boss, okay?

559
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,228
I just don't want people to know
that I'm working with my cousin.

560
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,105
So, you are not my cousin.

561
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,482
You are not
George Michael Bluth.

562
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,192
I'm great with that.

563
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,278
In fact, you know what might
really help us sell it...

564
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,823
Oh, heiress. You meant...
You don't pronounce the "H."

565
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:52,159
- And that's not what heiress
means. - I pronounce the "H."

566
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,952
No, but that's not how
the word is...

567
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,787
You know, we say words the way
we say them for a reason.

568
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,372
So what is this?

569
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,540
Is this another one of these
social networking things?

570
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,126
Because I am so over those.

571
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,711
I tried to deactivate
my Facebook profile.

572
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:06,714
It's easier to get out
of Scientology.

573
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,925
Well, this is actually
the opposite of Facebook.

574
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,718
It's the antisocial network.

575
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,637
It prevents piracy, right?

576
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,055
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

577
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,099
Rebel Alley.

578
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,767
George Mi... Harris.

579
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,894
George Maharis, huh?

580
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:22,939
<i>And that's how George Michael</i>
<i>finally got that new name.</i>

581
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:25,317
<i>It felt like a good fit--</i>
<i>strong, rugged...</i>

582
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,027
- Yes.
<i>- ...untainted.</i>

583
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:28,820
Yes, George Maharis.

584
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:31,031
- Perfecto.
<i>- De nada.</i>

585
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:33,950
That's my undercover
cop boyfriend.

586
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,410
I'm trying to get him in bed.

587
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:37,454
<i>And Maeby set to work</i>
<i>in trapping him</i>

588
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:40,332
<i>- into becoming a predator.</i>
- Hey. I know why you're here.

589
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:42,167
Promise me you won't tell anyone
at school.

590
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,211
I'm just a huge fan
of teen stars.

591
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,920
- Yeah. That's very convincing.
- Yeah.

592
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,964
You're a better actor
than most of the kids here.

593
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,757
- Even Zack and Cody.
- Are they here?

594
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,968
I thought they were filming
a movie in Maui.

595
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,721
Look, I may only be 17,
Perfecto,

596
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:55,889
but I know you're a cop.

597
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,724
Yeah, there it is,
that cop stare.

598
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,352
I got to tell you,
I find it very sexy.

599
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,855
Okay. Okay, all right.

600
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:06,525
I'm a cop.
I'm working here undercover.

601
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,402
We're hunting down an ex-CIA
operative named Esteves

602
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:09,694
who's gone rogue, and...

603
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,946
It's the kids
from "Modern Family."

604
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:14,574
Sorry.
He's become a drug kingpin

605
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:16,493
and his son goes to Newport.
There's something going down

606
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,203
tonight or possibly even
at Cinco and that...

607
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,996
Rico!

608
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,706
Wow, you are good.

609
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,334
I have to be--
young lives depend on it.

610
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,045
To be continued.

611
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,172
You better believe it.

612
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:30,840
Rico!

613
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:33,301
<i>On her way to accept</i>
<i>her award, however,</i>

614
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:36,137
<i>figuring she wouldn't be</i>
<i>at an event like this again,</i>

615
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,307
<i>she stopped for</i>
<i>some coconut shrimp.</i>

616
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,437
<i>But narrowly missed the $50,000</i>
<i>check with her name on it</i>

617
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:46,189
<i>that her mother gave</i>
<i>to her grandfather...</i>

618
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,402
<i>- ...who gave it to this man.</i>
- Got the check.

619
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,446
<i>- Who gave it to this man.</i>
- Oh, man.

620
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:54,281
- Whoa.
- Oh.

621
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:55,823
<i>Although, in that moment,</i>

622
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,200
<i>she did gain some respect</i>
<i>for her mother</i>

623
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:59,244
...a random act
of senseless nonviolence.

624
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,121
<i>And perhaps that's why</i>
<i>she chose to share</i>

625
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,914
<i>- her problems with her.</i>
- So, what are you doing here?

626
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:04,916
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award

627
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,294
for my work
in the entertainment business.

628
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:08,711
I tried.

629
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,464
Tell your therapist I tried.

630
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:13,300
I'm not in therapy!

631
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:15,093
Then I must have done
something right.

632
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,345
<i>And soon, she was saying</i>
<i>farewell to Hollywood</i>

633
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,931
<i>in a way she hoped</i>
<i>they'd remember.</i>

634
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,558
Thank you, Kirk Cameron,

635
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,144
for that incredibly
Bibley introduction.

636
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:26,854
Okay, so tie yourself
to your chair,

637
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,316
because this is going to be
a rough (bleep) ride.

638
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,610
I'm leaving this (bleep)
dying business

639
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,487
to join the software game.

640
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,196
Double (bleep) newsflash.

641
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,907
I'm starting Fakeblock
with George Maharis,

642
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:39,534
the world's first
antisocial network.

643
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:41,578
So you know what?
You can take this Opie

644
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,830
and shove it up your (bleep),
all right?

645
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,790
Because I will (bleep) punt
the next god(bleep) (bleep)

646
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,168
who tells me I'm finished,
you (bleep) (bleep)hats.

647
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,086
So you can all
go (bleep) yourselves!

648
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:52,755
What? Sure.

649
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:56,384
Please welcome the talented
voices of Phineas and Ferb.

650
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:58,595
Go (bleep) yourself!

651
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:01,806
(bleep) you.

652
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:05,018
<i>And although she was pursued,</i>
<i>she was able to shake security</i>

653
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,270
<i>when a bigger problem occurred.</i>

654
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:09,481
- (explosion)
- Right this way, sir.

655
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:12,942
<i>And after the explosion,</i>
<i>Maeby saw her mother</i>

656
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:15,862
<i>whoring out her principles,</i>
<i>and quickly lost the respect</i>

657
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,405
<i>- she had briefly held...</i>
- I'd like that very much.

658
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:18,739
Sir, the press awaits.

659
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,283
<i>...and decided to call her</i>
<i>on it.</i>

660
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:21,993
Are you really gonna
whore yourself out like that?

661
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,953
- I am not a whore.
- Yeah, you're a whore.

662
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:25,704
<i>As it turns out,</i>
<i>the exchange</i> was

663
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,624
<i>witnessed by Herbert Love's</i>
<i>campaign manager,</i>

664
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,084
<i>who, in possession of</i>
<i>a third-party check</i>

665
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:32,170
<i>from "Gangie IV: Face Lift,"</i>

666
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:35,006
<i>was looking to trade</i>
<i>some greenbacks for a redhead.</i>

667
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:36,424
Ma'am, is she yours?

668
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,343
Unfortunately.

669
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,136
Herbert Love would like
to see her.

670
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:41,555
You can arrange that?

671
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:44,098
Obviously,
discretion is appreciated.

672
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,808
<i>And that's how Maeby</i>
<i>got both the seed money</i>

673
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,727
<i>- for her company...</i>
- I'm the discreetiest.

674
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,314
And just to be clear, I want
to hire her for prostitution.

675
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:52,773
Yes, no, definitely.

676
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,651
That was clear.
I'm gonna charge you for that.

677
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:56,903
<i>...and became</i>
<i>her mother's pimp.</i>

678
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:59,155
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>the plan required getting back</i>

679
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,700
<i>into her mother's good graces</i>
<i>to trick her</i>

680
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,910
<i>- into turning a trick.</i>
- Hi, sweetie.

681
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,371
Free... bie. Hi.

682
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:07,581
<i>But the universe seemed</i>
<i>to like the plan.</i>

683
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:08,956
<i>And that's how Maeby was able</i>

684
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:10,542
<i>to get her mother</i>
<i>to meet Herbert</i>

685
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,419
<i>at the club</i>
<i>that Maeby still belonged to.</i>

686
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,421
...I could never call him.

687
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:16,339
I could call him for you.

688
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:18,425
<i>Technically, she still needed</i>
<i>to talk her mother</i>

689
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:20,385
<i>into having sex with him.</i>

690
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:23,430
<i>But this was a woman who once</i>
<i>wore this to a men's prison,</i>

691
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,474
<i>so she felt she'd be okay.</i>

692
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,226
<i>- And soon, she was pimping out</i>
- Can you believe this?

693
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:31,438
<i>George Michael's</i>
<i>software company as well.</i>

694
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,022
Fakeblock-- it's exploding.

695
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:34,649
I got my P.R. company
fanning it.

696
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:36,651
I even got it to the attention
of Jim Cramer.

697
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,860
Jim Cramer?

698
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:39,738
He's a guy I've worked with,

699
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,531
and he even mentioned it
on "Mad Money."

700
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:43,866
This Fakeblock thing
is poised to explode!

701
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:47,120
I never do this, hell,
it's not even a stock yet.

702
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,955
For all I know,
it's not even real!

703
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,416
But I think this might be
going through the roof!

704
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,711
I'm calling it my first
"Hypothetical Buy."

705
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:56,129
(bull bellows)

706
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,547
And this weekend,
don't forget to catch me

707
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,132
on "Gangie IV."
Here's a taste.

708
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,967
This old lady's crazy!

709
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:04,304
I'm raising the alert level
from "Don't Leave the House"

710
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:08,141
to "Board Up Your Windows!"

711
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:10,143
<i>Over the following days,</i>
<i>Maeby was able</i>

712
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:13,020
<i>to discreetly bring in cash</i>
<i>from Herbert Love</i>

713
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:15,732
<i>for services she got her mother</i>
<i>to unknowingly render.</i>

714
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:19,444
Well, why don't you take him out
to dinner?

715
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:21,571
Hmm? Guys who are used
to being charged--

716
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:23,239
I mean in charge,

717
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,824
sometimes like it when the other
person takes control.

718
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:28,328
Hmm. Well, maybe I will.

719
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,996
How about
the Balboa Yacht Club, huh?

720
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:32,039
- Put it on the family tab.
- Of course.

721
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:34,250
All right, have fun.
I wish I could go out to dinner.

722
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:36,835
What am I doing?
This is disgusting.

723
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:38,546
I've got money coming in.

724
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:40,298
<i>All the while putting money</i>
<i>into the company...</i>

725
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,009
...ultimate privacy on the Web
until now.

726
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,094
If you don't believe me,
do a something search on it.

727
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,097
<i>...and bringing in more cash</i>
<i>as a result--</i>

728
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:51,726
<i>her self-esteem growing</i>
<i>every day.</i>

729
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:53,436
<i>Soon, she had enough money</i>

730
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:56,564
<i>for an apartment and to set up</i>
<i>a Fakeblock office.</i>

731
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:59,984
Right. Um, do you want
some stock options?

732
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,986
Yeah? All right, well,
split it up with everyone.

733
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,822
That's for everybody.

734
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,408
<i>She even got George Michael</i>
<i>a cool retro company car.</i>

735
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,994
- Hey. - Hi. You actually
rented a little office.

736
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:12,038
Yeah. I don't want you to see
it yet. Still setting it up.

737
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,291
With a little help from a
wealthy benefactor, Lucille 2.

738
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,627
- Oh, Gangie.
- No, Lucille 2.

739
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:18,837
Austero.

740
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,755
I don't know who that is.

741
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:22,590
You don't?

742
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:24,300
Never met the woman.

743
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:26,720
Well, she'll be the one driving
the staircar from now on.

744
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:28,847
- It was part of the deal.
- You gave her my car?

745
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,682
Yeah, it's technically
hers anyways,

746
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,350
- 'cause of the Bluth Company.
- Oh.

747
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:35,353
- But I did get you her
1988 yellow Cadillac. - Yeah?

748
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,397
She only uses it
to and from hip replacements.

749
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:38,897
(laughs)

750
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:42,360
I guess that's only funny
if you know who she is.

751
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:44,654
<i>And with the extra cash,</i>
<i>even got around to spraying</i>

752
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:47,365
<i>for pests at the model home</i>
<i>where she was squatting.</i>

753
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,993
GOB: ...that I never got from
you for the last 40 years.

754
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:52,453
Hey, so what do I owe you?

755
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:54,247
Here you go.

756
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:57,166
That's funny, I actually used
to date a guy named Steve Holt.

757
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,959
Ha! Steve Holt!

758
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,294
Yeah, that's the guy.

759
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:02,714
Oh...
(chuckles)

760
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,049
<i>Although the house wouldn't</i>
<i>remain pest-free for long.</i>

761
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,343
Heck of a birthday
this is shaping up to be.

762
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:10,764
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was about to get worse.</i>

763
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:13,099
<i>And Maeby's privacy</i>
<i>was about to get violated...</i>

764
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,726
- Why did we stop?
- We hit a bug.

765
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,644
<i>...when her uncles</i>
<i>barged in unannounced.</i>

766
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:19,439
I know, I know, I've got these
things very, you know,

767
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,399
- meticulously maintained.
- (bleep)

768
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:23,192
- There's...
- There are some vultures.

769
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:24,569
They might still smell Pete.

770
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:26,237
<i>And she still managed</i>
<i>to continue</i>

771
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,197
<i>seducing Perfecto</i>
<i>into seducing her.</i>

772
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,574
I'm like, this top is
completely see-through.

773
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,033
I'll put it on and show you.

774
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,786
I'm like, "Where am I
supposed to wear this?"

775
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:35,538
<i>This high school senior</i>
<i>was working three jobs.</i>

776
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,582
- Okay, buh-buh-buh-buh.
- We have to be discreet.

777
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,918
<i>- And she did her jobs well.</i>
- What? - We have to be discreet!

778
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,628
- Oh, right.
<i>- And soon, it was time</i>

779
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,422
<i>for Maebyto show</i>
<i>George Michael the office.</i>

780
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:46,965
(tires screeching)

781
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:50,762
Welcome!

782
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,472
- (Mort laughs)
- I'm a softie; I hired the guy.

783
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:54,432
He's more like a mascot
than anything.

784
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,934
Mort, where's my coffee?

785
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,728
Oh, damn. Oh, stupid Mort.

786
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,020
I know, it's okay, just focus.

787
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:01,355
I'm going to take the cart

788
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:03,357
and show George Michael
his new office.

789
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,234
Speechless, huh?

790
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:06,778
How do I get back?!

791
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,154
Of course, when Fakeblock hits,

792
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:10,114
we're going to have to ramp up
real fast.

793
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:13,367
This hangar can hold
over 500 nerds!

794
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,703
Maeby, we can't afford this.

795
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,539
- And my software isn't even
ready. - Don't worry about that.

796
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:20,082
Just worry about the app
being done in time

797
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:21,960
for the big public unveiling
at Cinco.

798
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,252
I'll get the money.

799
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:24,587
Isn't that in, like, three days?

800
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:25,922
Uh, no, that's Cinco de Mayo.

801
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:27,757
Cinco de Quatro is in two days.

802
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,510
But we'll be doing it on a boat,
so I hope you don't get seasick.

803
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:31,970
You're doing the keynote.

804
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,515
You're responsible
for all of this.

805
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:38,726
- Come on.
- Wh... No, I...

806
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:40,895
I-I... I think we, uh...

807
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,563
All of this.

808
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:44,440
Oh, I think we should delay
the keynote.

809
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,860
You know, I'd say yes,
but I don't think we can

810
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,277
just because of the sheer amount
of money

811
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,696
that you have on the hook
for it.

812
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:52,281
Maeby, you're fired!

813
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:53,950
(Mort panting)

814
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,118
MORT:
I got her coffee.

815
00:28:57,745 --> 00:29:00,957
NARRATOR:<i>Maeby had just lost</i>
<i>a big career option</i>

816
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:03,250
<i>when she ran into the current</i>

817
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,878
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Maeby.

818
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,587
Wow. What are you doing here?

819
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:08,631
I'm just here to see Lucille 2,
actually.

820
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:11,425
<i>In fact, she was there</i>
<i>to see Lucille 2's</i>

821
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,761
<i>so-called foster child,</i>
<i>Perfecto.</i>

822
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,680
...talk to you about something
very important.

823
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:17,932
Yeah, um, Uncle Michael,

824
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:19,559
I-I'm really sorry about
that whole

825
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,310
"voting you out of the dorm"
thing.

826
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:23,688
- You know... - You know,
we never really meant it to...

827
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,105
Ah, I knew it.

828
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:26,649
I knew you didn't understand it.

829
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:28,275
I knew you guys were all...

830
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:30,737
'Cause I didn't...
I don't think I explained it

831
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,154
very well,
and it was very, very simple.

832
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,573
I made it complicated.

833
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:35,241
It was a four-person vote.

834
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:37,994
You see, I voted against myself,
so that P-Hound...

835
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,996
And that's a way that-that
scenario would've worked out.

836
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:41,915
What I later realized is that
there was another scenario--

837
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,165
Maeby. That there was
another scenario,

838
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:44,751
- Yeah.
- a C scenario, scenario C,

839
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,335
- where you... Okay.
- I really got to get going.

840
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:47,879
- All right, but before
you do, - I got to... Yeah.

841
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,714
I just need your signature here
at the bottom.

842
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:51,173
Doing a movie about

843
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:53,133
- the family.
- Yeah. Is that still happening?

844
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,802
- What do you mean?
- I got to tell you,

845
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:55,970
I think movies are dead.

846
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:58,389
Maybe it's a TV show.

847
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,934
- Thank you. I owe you one.
- Yeah. No, you don't.

848
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,435
NARRATOR:
<i>And now a half hour late,</i>

849
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:04,520
<i>Maeby went back to her plan</i>

850
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,814
<i>of seducing an undercover cop.</i>

851
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:08,733
<i>And that's when Lucille 2</i>

852
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:12,319
<i>saw a very real girl</i>
<i>in her imaginary boy's room.</i>

853
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:15,281
<i>And after,</i>
<i>secure that she had something</i>

854
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:18,367
<i>with which</i>
<i>to blackmail Perfecto,</i>

855
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,912
<i>she sought out a late payment</i>
<i>from the Love campaign</i>

856
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:22,663
<i>at Cinco.</i>
<i>As it turns out,</i>

857
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:25,332
<i>the Love campaign</i>
<i>had just taken care</i>

858
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,793
<i>of a threat of their own.</i>

859
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,628
- Why can't I do this?
<i>- And that's when</i>

860
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,129
<i>Maeby ran into her mother.</i>

861
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,547
Oh, Maeby.

862
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:32,673
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

863
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:34,133
I need to apologize to you.

864
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:36,427
That check
you've been looking for,

865
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:38,054
I had it.

866
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:39,263
"Had"?

867
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,473
It's not everything,

868
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:42,224
but here's some money.

869
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,685
(chuckles)
Mom, let go.

870
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,020
(sighs)
It's dirty money anyway.

871
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:48,064
Love gave it to me.

872
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:49,899
NARRATOR:
<i>Maeby felt bad.</i>

873
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,818
He gave you money directly?

874
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:53,152
If you can believe that.

875
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:54,904
Anyway, this is your money now,

876
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:58,699
and if you choose
to do facial reconstruction...

877
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:01,077
I mean, the nose, right?

878
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,914
<i>But Maeby was more concerned</i>

879
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:07,541
<i>about losing</i>
<i>yet another income stream.</i>

880
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,336
So he's trying to snake
the bottom bitch from my stable?

881
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:13,006
<i>And more importantly,</i>
<i>her rep on the street.</i>

882
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:15,215
<i>And she knew</i>
<i>just who to go to about it.</i>

883
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:16,884
He stole money from me.

884
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:19,053
He's a bully, so I want you

885
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:21,263
to "bad cop" him
for me a little, okay?

886
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,556
So where is this bully?

887
00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:24,934
He's right there.

888
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,268
The little guy
with the cigarette?

889
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,812
No, the ripped black guy
behind him.

890
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:29,689
- Oh, right.
<i>- Perfecto was nervous...</i>

891
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,858
I just... I just didn't look
up high enough.

892
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,901
<i>...but headed off</i>
<i>to do as told.</i>

893
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:35,528
- Herbert Love, Herbert Love...
<i>- And later,</i>

894
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,155
<i>after Herbert Love</i>
<i>didn't return,</i>

895
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:39,281
<i>- Perfecto did.</i>
- Hey, did you do it?

896
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:40,533
It's taken care of.

897
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:42,535
- Oh.
- (shouting)

898
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:44,328
<i>But that's when</i>
<i>the party got out of control.</i>

899
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,997
- (clamoring)
- What's going on?

900
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,247
Guess the blowback has started.

901
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:48,541
Thank God I'm with
an undercover cop.

902
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:49,542
Pull out your gun.

903
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,835
I don't have a gun.

904
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:52,045
What kind of cop
doesn't have a gun?

905
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,921
Okay, I'm not a cop.

906
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:55,923
But I saw your badge at the bar.

907
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:59,218
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was an anti-bullying badge.</i>

908
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,137
<i>He'd received it</i>
<i>from a police-run</i>

909
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:03,389
<i>anti-bullying program</i>
<i>at school.</i>

910
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,807
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

911
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,809
PERFECTO:<i>I made up</i>
<i>all that stuff</i>

912
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:08,978
to impress you;
I'm just a senior.

913
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,688
A señor?

914
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,106
I'm 17.

915
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:13,774
Ha!

916
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:15,651
You're 17?

917
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:16,777
Yeah.

918
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,612
I'm 23.

919
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,156
Oh, that's a relief.

920
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,991
I wasn't supposed
to be driving with you.

921
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,450
But we messed around.

922
00:32:23,492 --> 00:32:26,079
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, they did more than that.</i>

923
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,538
(horn blows)

924
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,123
Don't worry; nobody saw.

925
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:31,375
<i>Except Lucille 2.</i>

926
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,586
<i>And that's when Maeby,</i>
<i>who had spent so long</i>

927
00:32:33,627 --> 00:32:37,131
<i>lying to others</i>
<i>and even herself,</i>

928
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:39,967
<i>finally had to admit</i>
<i>she had made a huge mis...</i>

929
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:42,136
Oh, no, I'm fine.

930
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:49,268
<i>...Lucille 2 becomes</i>
<i>less of a threat to Maeby.</i>

931
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:52,563
...is an ongoing investigation,
we are pretty certain

932
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,233
that this is where
Lucille Austero landed.

933
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,568
It is the way she usually falls.

934
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,028
Are you gonna run in her place?

935
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,614
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's not bury her yet.

936
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,657
We are all
still holding out hope

937
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:05,785
that she is, indeed, found.

938
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:10,039
<i>But a new threat</i>
<i>to Maeby emerges.</i>

939
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:11,290
Shh. Stop it. What?

940
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:12,792
Can we at least have
breakup sex?

941
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,418
No, you're 17.

942
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm 23-year-old woman.

943
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,630
If anyone found out
that we already had sex,

944
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,632
it would be a major felony.

945
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:22,593
Congratulations.
You got your first A.

946
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,679
Oh, thank God. This A is finally
gonna get me out of high school.

947
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:28,390
No, sex offender,
your A is going to jail.

948
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,726
You can't arrest me;
you're an algebra teacher.

949
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:33,104
Donny Richter is
an algebra teacher.

950
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,814
I'm Rocky Richter.

951
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:37,608
I told you there was an
undercover cop in this school.

952
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,651
(handcuffs clicking)

953
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,319
Oh, God.

954
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,268
I'm gonna have to live
in Sudden Valley.

2
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:10,045
On the top of a hillside,

3
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:13,247
deep in the mountains
of Shuturmurg, India,

4
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,083
sits a mystical retreat
long sought out

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,210
- by those seeking answers...
- Is this real?

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,796
to the questions
that define us.

7
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:21,464
I mean, is any of this real?

8
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:23,466
How do I know what's real?

9
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,927
This is Lindsay Bluth-Fünke.

10
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,887
You see me before you, yes?

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,807
I am real to you.

12
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:34,935
And this bag next to me,
it is as real as you or me.

13
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:36,312
No, I know that one's real.

14
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:37,896
I meant the other one--
the Louis Vuitton.

15
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,856
I don't remember Vuitton
having two E's.

16
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,693
The hillside was also known

17
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,778
- for their bargains on designer handbags.
- Oh, no!

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,488
That's how they do it here.

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,740
You can't go wrong.
Best bag on the mountain.

20
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,992
I love this bag.
I give you 60 for it.

21
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,661
- It's the best bag on the mountain.
- Excuse me.

22
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,705
- I just promised it to her.
- I'll give you $70.

23
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:55,956
Lindsay Bluth had come
to India for both reasons.

24
00:00:55,998 --> 00:00:58,376
- Uh, $120. - You just bought
the best bag on the mountain.

25
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,712
- Congratulations.
- Best bag on the mountain.

26
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,090
Now the story of a family

27
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,593
whose future
was abruptly canceled

28
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,887
and the one daughter
who had no choice

29
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:12,097
but to keep her life together.

30
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:18,312
It's Lindsay's...

31
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,483
- I love it.
- Lindsay was on

32
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,151
a spiritual journey to let go

33
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:26,779
of all possessions
and to find something cute

34
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,406
- to keep her stuff in.
- It's gorgeous.

35
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:31,075
Months earlier,
Lindsay had lost her bearings

36
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:33,578
after finding out
she wasn't born

37
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,454
to the family
she couldn't bear.

38
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,623
- I'm adopted?
- So, after getting

39
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,584
briefly creepy
with her brother...

40
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,669
I'm just not that into
older women.

41
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,170
- Don't worry about it.
- You bastard!

42
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,547
She shared some resentments

43
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:46,424
with her family
at the boat party.

44
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:48,342
Kitty likes to scratch...

45
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,052
But before she could
disassociate herself

46
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:52,137
- from the Bluth name...
- Because now I know that

47
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,514
we're not related.
Anyway, Michael...

48
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:54,891
Oh, my God. The SEC.

49
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,351
...the Bluth name
would become...

50
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,812
...as sullied as Newport Bay
on the fifth of May.

51
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,731
They are persecuting me.

52
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,734
It was an accident.
This is ridiculous!

53
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,570
If I'd told them we were taking
a bunch of gays out there

54
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:09,530
to get married,
they'd have thrown me a parade.

55
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:13,242
Let's tell them we were taking
a bunch of gays to get married.

56
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,035
Yeah, I don't think your record
on that issue

57
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:16,287
is going to back that up, Mom.

58
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:17,747
In fact, it was an issue

59
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,415
of theBay Windowmagazine

60
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:21,375
that would most damage her
with the gay community.

61
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,628
Fine. We'll say
they took it on a joyride.

62
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,755
And you have no right
to criticize me.

63
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,299
At least I was able
to turn myQueenaround.

64
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,634
None taken.

65
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,469
This is Tobias Fünke,

66
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,178
who should have taken more.

67
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,806
- Oh.
- You cannot say

68
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:37,475
one nice thing
to your daughter, can you?

69
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:38,684
Adopted daughter.

70
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,853
And that's not true.

71
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,606
Could I have the Bluth
family over here, please?

72
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,108
And over here, the victims
of the Bluth family?

73
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,402
And that's when Lindsay

74
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:51,071
found a label more fitting
than "Bluth."

75
00:02:51,113 --> 00:02:53,365
No, Lindsay, you're going
to the wrong area.

76
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,034
Kenny, Chet, Curtis, Mike,
Bix and Gator are over here.

77
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,871
We should be over here
at the Bluth area with Gob

78
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:01,833
and Buster and, uh... uh...

79
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,418
uh, your brother, uh...

80
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,378
- Michael?
- Michael. Yes.

81
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,256
Sorry. I was thinking
of Mike, the hot seaman.

82
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,509
- No, where is Michael?
- It doesn't matter.

83
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,760
He's not my brother.

84
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:14,136
This isn't my family.

85
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,514
No, I've spent years...

86
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,850
Yes! Got my yes.
I got that big yes.

87
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:22,102
I've spent years trying
to fit into this family,

88
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:23,479
and it's not me.

89
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:25,857
My life is a fallacy.

90
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,483
Oh...

91
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,151
♪ Is that a gal I see? ♪

92
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:32,822
♪ No, it's just
a phallus... eee! ♪

93
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,324
We loved that.
Where's that from?

94
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,993
It's from nothing.

95
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,244
But it made her
realize this, too.

96
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,080
I don't know if there's
a right time to say this,

97
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,459
but this marriage of ours,
it hasn't been working.

98
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:49,714
Yeah... there's nothing
keeping us together.

99
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:54,927
I... I believe we're thinking
the same thing.

100
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,304
- Yeah, we should end it.
- Let's give it another shot.

101
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,139
To the head. Kill it.

102
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,683
Yes.

103
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,438
Lindsay was looking
for inspiration

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,984
before she set out
on her new path.

105
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:12,194
And it only took
until the "Pray" section

106
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:15,573
of Eat, Pray, Love
for her to find it.

107
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,282
Hmm.

108
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,786
Soon, she was beginning
a journey to reinvent herself.

109
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,496
Ugh. I'm doing it again.

110
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:25,457
I have to let go
of these material things.

111
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,919
To leave the trappings
of her old life

112
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,588
and try to live with less.

113
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,381
There.

114
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,383
Her immersion
into Indian culture began

115
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,176
even before reaching
the airport.

116
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:37,845
And, uh...
and so this daily prayer,

117
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,129
it connects one to the whole.

118
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,301
- anus tart.
- God.

119
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,636
You know,
you sense the oneness in all.

120
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:46,765
And they have
normal toilets, right?

121
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:48,433
And after an hour or so

122
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,560
withSkyMall,where she was

123
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:53,397
proud of herself
for only buying two things--

124
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:56,691
a self-cleaning litter box
in case she ever got a cat

125
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:01,280
and an inflatable hat box
in case she ever got a hat--

126
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:03,990
she got to a great article
in the in-flight magazine

127
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:06,076
and found herself filling up

128
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,203
with inner peace
and acceptance.

129
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,455
I mean, not right away.

130
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:11,998
What is she doing back there?

131
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,959
That passenger had been

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,378
pushing on her seat
for like four hours.

133
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,881
Lindsay's journey
to let go of her baggage

134
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:22,675
got off to a bad start
at baggage claim

135
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:25,553
when she picked up
the wrong baggage.

136
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,847
And her Western notions
of the value of life

137
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:30,183
were challenged on the bus ride
to the hotel.

138
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:32,560
Oh, my God.

139
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:35,063
Did... did we just
hit something?

140
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,648
Shouldn't we stop?

141
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:38,650
No. It wasn't a cow.

142
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:41,611
It was just a tourist.

143
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:43,613
And that's howLindsay's path

144
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,032
- to living with less...
- Wait. This isn't my...

145
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,201
How am I supposed to find out

146
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,078
who I really am
dressed like this chick?

147
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,457
...took a brief detour into
a shopping spree at India's

148
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,541
- famous Mall Mountain.
- It's cute on me.

149
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,961
But I thought it was
supposed to say "Kate."

150
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:00,797
Oh, no, anything under a small
is considered

151
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,382
a "David Spade."

152
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:04,384
I love this jacket.
I'll give you 60 for it.

153
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,551
Best coat on the mountain.

154
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,762
- 65.
- 70! It'd look great

155
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:09,473
on my wife or my sickly son.

156
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,391
- 100 bucks. Yes!
- $100, yes.

157
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,809
And soon, she was back

158
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:14,227
at the hotel and ready

159
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,480
for her spiritual experience.

160
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:20,524
Yeah, hi.

161
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,444
Uh, were you able
to book my 3:00 shaman?

162
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:24,237
Oh, yes.
Did you want the deep wisdom

163
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,529
or just a light ego cleanse?

164
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:26,865
We do those by the pool.

165
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:28,741
- There's a pool?
- It's hard to tell

166
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,494
because there are
so many people in it,

167
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,620
but yes, it is a pool.

168
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,039
Well, yeah, by the pool, then.

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,208
And, uh, do you think
you can get someone

170
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:39,127
to remove the smell of lamb
from my room?

171
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,380
Of course. And which
animal smell would you prefer?

172
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,922
Which do you prefer?

173
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,342
But at her 3:00 p.m. shaman...

174
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:47,927
You are living a life
without love.

175
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,929
- Lindsay got a deeper treatment
- How do I learn to...

176
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,515
- than she had hoped for.
- be happy?

177
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,099
You know, to love?

178
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:56,395
When love is near your heart,
you'll be happy.

179
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:59,481
You must live life truthfully.

180
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:02,692
Yeah, no, I-I-I do live
truthfully,

181
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,361
but, uh...

182
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:06,905
I'm just so full of passion.

183
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:08,990
You are so full of.

184
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:10,367
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,577
Although, in my culture,
"full of"

186
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:13,953
is kind of like a dig.

187
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:16,081
I mean, you'd never say it
to a customer.

188
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:18,250
But, uh, yeah, no,
I-I know what you mean.

189
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,169
This bag is as fake as you are.

190
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,380
Well, how do I learn?

191
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:24,797
Just look at the spelling.

192
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,258
God. No, I...

193
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,343
Pull your head out of the sand.

194
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,720
Love is where you left it.

195
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:33,181
You mean... back home?

196
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:34,433
God.

197
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:36,435
The only person back home
is Tobias.

198
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,686
You have no children?

199
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:41,064
Lindsay thought
she was being hit on.

200
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,525
No. Why do you ask?

201
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,069
Wait a minute.
You're saying I've come

202
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:47,987
halfway around the world
to find out

203
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:49,406
I need to go back home?

204
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,950
God, I haven't even gone
to the beach yet.

205
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:55,954
She had. It was just
too crowded to see the water.

206
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,706
It was a moving experience,

207
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:00,875
but after leaving the tent,
it wasn't just

208
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,253
the shaman's words
that got through to her.

209
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,588
It was this.

210
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,590
I'm sorry.
Your AmEx was declined.

211
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:07,924
Your account is maxed out.

212
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,801
We had to cancel
your shaman appointment.

213
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:11,719
No, no, I just talked
to the shaman,

214
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,472
just right back at...

215
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:16,808
Get out! Get out!

216
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,394
Go away! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

217
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm sorry to yell at you,
but as I said, it was declined.

218
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:26,401
So get out.

219
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,361
But, fortunately, the universe

220
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,447
offered a solution
to her financial problem

221
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:33,699
that wasn't too far off
from what her shaman had said.

222
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,868
Oh, I've
got money for you, sweetie,

223
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,497
but it means my loving daughter
smiling next to her husband

224
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:39,998
sitting behind me at the trial.

225
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,583
Would you take a grimace?

226
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,044
So it was with
this dual intention

227
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:48,965
that she reached out
to a husband she'd left behind,

228
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,426
with a new sense
of inner peace.

229
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,178
Of course, there was still
some outer stuff

230
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,429
she needed to work through.

231
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,763
Hello. It's Tobias.

232
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,015
Leave a message.

233
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm ready to make this work.

234
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:03,855
It was with a sense
of enlightenmentthat Lindsay

235
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:05,815
returned from her
spiritual journey...

236
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:08,109
...to get her hands on
the stimulus money, too, right?

237
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:09,653
Stop with the prayer hands.

238
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,321
It just looks
like you're out of ideas.

239
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:13,615
Seriously, shoot me
if you ever catch me doing that.

240
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:15,325
Says the least spiritual
man I know.

241
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,452
What deal
did you strike with her?

242
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,871
What part of her soul
did you buy?

243
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:21,540
All I've asked
is that she testify

244
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,417
that I was a wonderful mother
who did her best.

245
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:25,793
So all of it.

246
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,962
No, Michael.
I'm not a whore.

247
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:29,381
I don't get any of the money

248
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:30,840
until after I do
the disgusting thing.

249
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:33,009
But I'm not here
just for the stimmy.

250
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,678
I'm here
because a shaman told me

251
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,888
that love is where I left it.

252
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:38,598
Which, after much soul searching

253
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,477
and by process of elimination,
is Tobias.

254
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,688
I got the part.

255
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:47,566
And so Lindsay and Tobias

256
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:50,235
took another shot
at being husband and wife,

257
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,070
and although they wouldn't
have money

258
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,573
until after the perjury,
they set about

259
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:56,658
- buying a home.
- Are you ready to make a move?

260
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,662
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

261
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,830
Oh! Good heavens!

262
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:03,998
Right!

263
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,458
Well, this is a great area.

264
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,168
There's some wonderful
surgi-centers nearby.

265
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,337
We're doing it.
We're really doing this.

266
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,381
Yes! We're gonna get you
in the right house.

267
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,550
And it's just the two of you?
You have no children?

268
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,760
We don't.

269
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,304
We should be honest here.

270
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:19,598
We have no income flow.

271
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,890
No incoming income flow.

272
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,392
We have plenty
of outgoing income.

273
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,102
No savings, no credit.

274
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:25,395
I mean, we had some stimmy,

275
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,813
but that went
to his hospital bills.

276
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:30,191
But there's one thing
we do have--

277
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,192
Work ethic!

278
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,444
Right. No work ethic.

279
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:33,778
But there's one thing
we do have--

280
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,572
we do have a daughter.

281
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,408
I was just on auto-pilot
before, when I said we didn't.

282
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,825
I should have caught that;
yeah, but...

283
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,411
I could've spoken up,

284
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:43,538
but I just wanted to see
if you guys got there.

285
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,164
Well, you guys seem like
a great family.

286
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,874
We have to be realistic.

287
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,293
I'm in the real estate business.

288
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,044
It's 2006.

289
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,130
That's all good enough for me.

290
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,673
We're gonna put you
in a NINJA loan.

291
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:55,717
"No income, no jobs,
no assets."

292
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,594
And you don't have to pay
a penny for two years.

293
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,053
Oh, NINJA! Please!

294
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,888
So we'll take something
cozy and intimate.

295
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,349
- A one-bedroom.
- Or bigger.

296
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,601
Yeah, how about something nice?
A three-bedroom?

297
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:05,685
Three does sound bigger.

298
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,437
Oh, it definitely is.

299
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,397
You have to remember
that this was a time

300
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,566
when banks were eager to create
as much debt as possible.

301
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:13,359
...the five-bedroom,
four-car garage.

302
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:15,945
And I know that you guys
are going to be okay

303
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:17,489
with just one master bathroom,

304
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,158
because a lot of people
do prefer two.

305
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,909
You know, they like
to just have it.

306
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,869
Maybe separate, so we have it.

307
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:25,413
So we have it.
That way we have it.

308
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:26,581
That way you have it.

309
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:27,957
Do you think
we really need one?

310
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,417
I'm just gonna
interrupt for a second.

311
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,210
You don't need a wine cellar,

312
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:33,797
if you want to do wine tastings
in your butler's kitchen.

313
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:35,923
I mean, this really isn't
what we discussed.

314
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,802
Well, we didn't discuss
any of this, but, uh...

315
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:41,179
yes, uh, I guess, that way,
we... we have it.

316
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,430
Well... yeah...

317
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:44,557
That way,
you'll definitely have it.

318
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:47,435
And then once you have it,
that way, you'll have it.

319
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,771
But do we need a gatehouse?

320
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:53,024
I just put John Beard into a
house with a double gatehouse.

321
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,485
Now, that's John Beard;
he's on television.

322
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:56,944
No one's gonna look down on you

323
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,904
just 'cause you have less
than John Beard.

324
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,657
- Is this crazy?
- I think so.

325
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,158
We'll take
the double gatehouse.

326
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,867
Oh, is that what you thought?
Because...

327
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,495
- Well, that way, we'll have it.
- We have it. We have it.

328
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:07,079
And that way, you have it.

329
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:08,164
There was a lot of this
going on back then.

330
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,249
This way, we have it.

331
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,001
And soon, they were
starting their new life

332
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:14,920
- Good point!
- in their new, beautiful home.

333
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:16,673
Mother's Day Eve

334
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,924
was the most joyous day
of the year.

335
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:21,093
Maeby, you're gonna
be late for school.

336
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,137
And what they lost
in coziness...

337
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,848
God, they grow up so slowly.

338
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:27,891
...they made up for in
cavernous, unfurnished space.

339
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:31,145
- And the robot's dead again.
- Oh! Poor little guy.

340
00:12:31,187 --> 00:12:35,191
Ran out of juice before
he could reach his...

341
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,444
With her mother's
trial coming up,

342
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:41,865
Lindsay made an effort
to work on her testimony.

343
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:43,199
...when I was hungry, I...

344
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,410
Go on.

345
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:47,953
You don't want me to say
this next part, do you?

346
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:49,581
I think it tells the story.

347
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:52,751
But am I
accidentally being funny,

348
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,169
or am I purposely being funny?

349
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,629
It's not supposed to be funny.

350
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,298
"Suckled at her champagne
glass breasts"?

351
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,383
Is it a joke?

352
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:01,593
Buster wrote it.

353
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,052
Recently?

354
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:05,304
I adapted it from a letter
he wrote from camp.

355
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:06,806
I miss you, Mommy.

356
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:08,266
Camp is scary at times.

357
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:09,975
When I was cold, you clothed me,

358
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,477
when I was hungry...

359
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,937
Uh, how do I say this?

360
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:17,483
Suckled at your champagne
glass breasts.

361
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,068
Oh, that's good.

362
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,612
It doesn't matter.
I'll be proofing it, anyway.

363
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:21,863
Oh, God.

364
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:24,407
This is from
Camp Kiss-A-Me-Mommy?

365
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:26,701
Just read the copy.
You're getting paid for this.

366
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:27,786
No. You know what?

367
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:28,994
The money is not
important to me.

368
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,413
My shaman said...

369
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:33,625
Oh, don't give me that
mystical nonsense.

370
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,710
You think you're
better than I am.

371
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:38,296
But you're a lot more like me
than you think you are.

372
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,757
Now, let's take it from:

373
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,718
"I hope she gives me
bubble baths forever."

374
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,720
And I want to smell the suds.

375
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:48,013
But worse news was
around the corner.

376
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,266
The collapse of the
California housing market

377
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,810
is taking a personal toll...

378
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,812
- Uh-oh.
- ...with layoffs here at the station.

379
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,855
In addition,
I'm leaving the keys

380
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,941
to my 10,000-square-foot home
in Harbor Shallows

381
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,109
- here on the desk...
- Well, it probably

382
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:01,444
shouldn't affect our area.

383
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,779
He's over by
where the fountain is.

384
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:03,905
Might I say to them

385
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:05,657
good luck getting that

386
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:07,617
raccoon smell
out of the gatehouse,

387
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,161
because I never could.

388
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:12,163
But you and I are okay, right?

389
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,165
I mean, this works, right?

390
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:15,792
Never better.

391
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,839
And the week
of Lucille's trial,

392
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,715
they got some even worse news.

393
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:25,551
What's this?
Mother's not going to pay?

394
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,470
She actually said
she'd only pay me

395
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:29,054
if my testimony is believable.

396
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,556
Lindsay! Lindsay!

397
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:32,099
...but how am I supposed
to say something like

398
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:33,100
"I love you, Mother!"

399
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:35,269
and sound believable?

400
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:37,605
Well, geez... Jesus C. Penny!

401
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,482
You know,
I wish I had the luxury

402
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,359
of not sounding believable.

403
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,028
But that's not an option for
an out-of-work actor, is it?

404
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:46,197
Or it's why you're out of work!

405
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:49,784
Well, I beg one's pardon,
but I have been dying to go

406
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:52,704
to that Method Acting Clinic
that I see on my nightly drives,

407
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:54,246
but you won't let me!

408
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:56,415
Because you already
wasted all that money

409
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,793
on Carl Weathers'
Master Acting Class.

410
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,921
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm such a star

411
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:04,883
that I didn't pay attention
to anything he said!

412
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:08,219
Oh, well then, maybe I should go
to your Method Acting Class,

413
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,304
to make my testimony
more believable!

414
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,681
That's actually a good idea.

415
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:14,141
Maybe you could--
Oh! Hi. Yes.

416
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,602
Well, perhaps we should
go together.

417
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,981
Yeah. Might be good
for us, as a couple.

418
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,816
I do hope so.

419
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:24,109
I really want
to make this work.

420
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:25,862
Me, too.

421
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,155
I really love you, Tobias.

422
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,866
Oh, Lindsay, we have

423
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,618
got to get you to
that acting clinic.

424
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,371
And that was with me
picturing fudge.

425
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:36,956
Fudge.

426
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:43,087
To bond with her husband

427
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:45,423
and prepare for her testimony,

428
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:48,300
Lindsay had decided to attend
an acting class with Tobias.

429
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:49,886
This is the first time

430
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,387
I've actually done something
like this with you.

431
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,264
I think I always
kind of looked down on it.

432
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:55,182
You know, Lindsay, I think
you'll find that

433
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:57,602
some of what used to seem
clueless about me

434
00:15:57,643 --> 00:16:00,312
is actually something
I'm quite good at.

435
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:03,190
This... is where I belong.

436
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,068
If you're new here,
you need to go to the window.

437
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,694
Uh, fill out this form first.

438
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,947
And there's some personal
questions on it, like, uh,

439
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:10,197
how you first got hooked.

440
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,574
Well, that's an easy one:

441
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:12,825
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

442
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:15,578
No, uh, no,Mame.

443
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,829
No, ma'am...?

444
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:18,247
You're A Good Man...

445
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,707
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

446
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:20,959
Gypsy. Gypsy.

447
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,251
Just come up here and be

448
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,045
as truthful as possible.

449
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,965
Okay, this is
overwhelming.

450
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,382
They're starting the monologues.

451
00:16:28,424 --> 00:16:30,927
I think this is from
Songs for My Father.

452
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:32,219
This  is
 up, right?

453
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:33,554
What did you say

454
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:34,639
the name of this acting class
was again?

455
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,807
Method One Clinic.

456
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:37,850
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

457
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:40,436
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

458
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,772
And moments later,
as Lindsay, once again,

459
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:46,358
found herself questioning
her husband's choices,

460
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,443
one of hers was questioned.

461
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:48,903
Ugh! That's not Free Trade,

462
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:50,655
and if it's not Free Trade,
it's.

463
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:52,364
I wouldn't...

464
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,075
You don't look like a junkie.

465
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,910
You do. What do you weigh,
like, 90 pounds?

466
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,121
That's so funny!

467
00:16:58,162 --> 00:16:59,664
God, um... thank you.

468
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,206
But-but no, no.

469
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,042
If I'm addicted to anything,
it's alcohol.

470
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:04,376
I'm Lindsay.

471
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:07,421
And you're... hmm!
"Bitéme."

472
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:10,008
No, I don't like giving my name
to any state organization,

473
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:11,968
especially after I got kicked
off the voter rolls,

474
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,470
'cause I accidentally signed up
for the wrong political group.

475
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,514
Wow.
What group was that?

476
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,808
You know, I don't even remember.

477
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,768
Just some guy in a booth
on the boardwalk.

478
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,394
He joined Al Qaeda.

479
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:23,562
And I only signed up
'cause he was giving away

480
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,064
a free beard brush.

481
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:27,150
...that says "Al Qaeda" on it.

482
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,028
But maybe he thought it was
the designer of the brush.

483
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,403
I'm Marky Bark.

484
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:33,238
Of the tree-freer Barks?

485
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,366
Marky was the son
of Johnny Bark,

486
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:38,243
an activist that Lindsay
had once helped save,

487
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,412
and then kill, a tree.

488
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:41,664
Oh, my God!
I remember him!

489
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:42,915
I remember thinking, one day,

490
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:44,542
he was just gonna
fall out of a tree

491
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,543
and break his neck.

492
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,003
Whatever happened to him?

493
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,212
He fell out of a tree
and broke his neck.

494
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:49,296
Oh, God...

495
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:50,381
No, I'm just kidding.

496
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:52,175
Oh...

497
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,258
So how is he?

498
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,301
Oh, he's dead.

499
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:56,261
But natural causes.

500
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,847
A bunch of deranged bees
chased him out of a tree

501
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,015
and he fell to his death.

502
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,349
So, are you here alone, or...?

503
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:01,559
No, I'm with her.

504
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,311
She's a committee member.

505
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,147
Which committee is that?

506
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,648
Itty-bitty.

507
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,234
What a wonderful sense of humor.

508
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,778
Listen, the only time DeBrie
can keep food down

509
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,279
is for about 20 minutes
after she comes crashing

510
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:15,489
off the methadone, so...

511
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,033
- Oh...
- would you care to join us

512
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,617
as we rustle up some grub

513
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,494
to shove down our mouths?

514
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:22,246
I would like that very much.

515
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:24,248
So Tobias and Lindsay drove

516
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,375
to meet their
new friends for lunch.

517
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,878
They are such a neat couple!

518
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,504
Aren't they neat!

519
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,048
It's so fun to have another
couple to go out with.

520
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,591
He's amazing.

521
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:35,927
I mean, so passionate
about real issues.

522
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:38,179
He's a real activist--
like me.

523
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,973
And she's a real actress,
like me!

524
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,059
Oh, she used to be
in big movies,

525
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,269
but then, like a lot of actors,
the teeth go...

526
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,395
Mm!

527
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:47,605
But she is the perfect age

528
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:50,233
to be a Hollywood actress--42.

529
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,483
Is that all?

530
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:52,944
Oh, I think this is the place.

531
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:55,029
It's a barter restaurant.

532
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,989
Marky doesn't believe in money.

533
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:59,033
Do I like barter?

534
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,160
No, it means
they don't deal with money.

535
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:02,828
That's why I swiped
that methadone tray.

536
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,496
Hmm.

537
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:06,791
What interesting friends
we've made.

538
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:09,877
I think this is exactly
what our marriage needed.

539
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:17,718
Lindsay and Tobias gathered

540
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,137
with their new friends...

541
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,263
Hi, y'all!
This your first time...?

542
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:22,723
...at CW Swappigans,

543
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:25,392
a chain that sprung up
after the economic collapse.

544
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:28,687
We are like a Salvation Army
meets a soup kitchen,

545
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,439
meets a gastro pub,

546
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:33,776
meets a Marxist-or
Leninist-type social structure.

547
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:35,527
These are things
that you can order

548
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:37,529
and these are things
that we will accept.

549
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:40,658
As you see on the bottom,
we don't have the fish,

550
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,367
and we're not taking
any more lava lamps.

551
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,829
Uh-oh!
I can see this one's got

552
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,413
that deer
in the headlights look!

553
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:48,874
Oh, no.
He just took some methadone.

554
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,044
He thought he was driving,
with a cocktail tray.

555
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:53,671
Oh, speaking of that...

556
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:55,798
How about mozzarella sticks
for the table?

557
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,010
Cocktail tray, light scratching,
for mozzarella sticks.

558
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:01,720
Six, no sauce.

559
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:04,640
And maybe some sparkling water
for the table.

560
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,976
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're no
longer taking hotel soaps.

561
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,519
This is fun.

562
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,604
A lot of people couldn't handle

563
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,439
a Dumpster dive
for their first double date.

564
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,484
Is that what this is?

565
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:18,112
Now, wait... wait a second.

566
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:20,614
I wasn't driving?

567
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:23,117
It's just so refreshing
to meet people

568
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:26,078
with real passion
about changing the status quo.

569
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,374
Lindsay and I
don't have a single friend.

570
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,625
Is the food here yet?

571
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,419
I'm not hungry,
but... but, uh...

572
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,922
- Oh, look, it's butter.
- DeBrie.

573
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,634
DeBrie, that's our butter.

574
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,970
We were going to swap it
for dessert.

575
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:45,056
No, she's improvising.
Uh, yes, ma'am.

576
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:47,099
You seem to be liking
that butter substitute

577
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,392
at Swappigans.

578
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,852
Uh, yes, and...

579
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:52,104
wh-what else could you swap for?

580
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:54,523
Uh, yes, and... uh...

581
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:55,983
Oh, I'm out. She's too good.

582
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,568
I... I don't know who my guy is.

583
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,028
I don't... I don't have a guy.

584
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,404
No, she just likes butter.

585
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:02,073
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

586
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:03,490
- Don't touch anything.
- Marky, I'll take her.

587
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:04,825
You two just got here.

588
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,535
Have a chat about.
I'll clean her up.

589
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,329
- Come on, DeBrie.
- Num, num, num, num.

590
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:09,830
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

591
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,332
I-I love it here.

592
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,500
My mother would hate this place.

593
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,294
You know, Lindsay,
I-I have to tell you,

594
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,588
when I first met you,
I thought you were one of those

595
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:21,425
typical, uptight, snobby,
Newport Beach,

596
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,552
vapid... nut-busters!

597
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:27,056
You know, one of those monsters

598
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:28,599
that lives in
a 10,000-square-foot house

599
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,101
that they destroyed
the wetlands for.

600
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:31,810
Those were wetlands?

601
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:34,272
That explains
our Thanksgiving miracle.

602
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:35,856
What do you mean,
you didn't make dinner?

603
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,566
I didn't realize
it was Thursday, okay?

604
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:39,318
There's got to be
something here.

605
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,196
Oh! Oh!

606
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:44,031
Oh! Get it! Get it!

607
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,741
Chase it into the oven!

608
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:48,077
Come on. Come on.
Here, little ducky.

609
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,828
- That's a good duck.
- Good duck.

610
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,290
In you go!

611
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:55,626
This is going to be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

612
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,878
It's a miracle!

613
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,588
Well, I actually do live

614
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,340
in a fairly large house
right now.

615
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:02,967
But we've never made
a payment on it.

616
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,551
So you're sticking it
to Big Banking.

617
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,720
- That's cool.
- Yes.

618
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:08,639
In fact, I'm only in America

619
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,349
because a shaman told me
that love

620
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,601
would come to me
when I accepted who I am

621
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:14,519
- and didn't run away.
- Sounds like a good shaman.

622
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:17,606
Oh, he was the house shaman
at the Four Seasons Mumbai,

623
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:20,483
so you figure
he's got to be pretty good.

624
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:23,404
Oh, and he turned into
an ostrich at the end, so...

625
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,823
They're not going to have that
at the Embassy Suites.

626
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:28,909
That's funny.
I actually run an ostrich farm.

627
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:33,205
♪ Co... incidence! ♪

628
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:35,291
That's not a coincidence.

629
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,584
♪ Yes, it is. ♪

630
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,837
Mini pizzas, no pepperoni!

631
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:41,297
Marky, I've got to tell you,

632
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:42,965
talking about these
social issues, it's...

633
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,550
the first time I've felt
like myself

634
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:47,178
in a really long time.

635
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,055
That's because I say
what I mean, I do what I feel.

636
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:51,474
No lies.

637
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:52,933
Lindsay felt guilty

638
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,810
because she was about
to go enter

639
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,854
a crab house/courtroom
and do just that.

640
00:22:56,895 --> 00:22:58,314
That's why my motto is:

641
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:01,025
"Live truthfully
and skate through life."

642
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,153
Marky felt guilty
because it wasn't his motto.

643
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,198
It was the motto of a surf
and skateboard company.

644
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,407
Live truthfully.

645
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:09,950
Skate through life.

646
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:12,535
That's amazing.

647
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:14,038
I haven't felt this deep

648
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,249
a connection with someone
in a long, long time.

649
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,671
Other than DeBrie.

650
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,631
I can't believe
we just did that.

651
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,591
I can't believe how little give
your teeth have.

652
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,677
So, where do you keep
your ostriches?

653
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,012
Sheraton mini soap
for a taco salad?

654
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:31,763
We don't take hotel soap!

655
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:33,724
And perhaps it was
to get back at her mother...

656
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:36,185
- Leave a tip! Leave a tip!
- ...or to get out of

657
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:38,854
a relationship that had
been over for a long time,

658
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,856
but that's when
Lindsay hopped off

659
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:44,026
to pursue a life
she felt was her destiny.

660
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:46,611
And the new lovers
discovered each other.

661
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,989
The beautiful female body,

662
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:51,242
the horrible male.

663
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,291
Wow. That was so...

664
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,168
- fast.
- Thanks.

665
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,754
Well, I didn't know how long
we'd be stuck in traffic, so...

666
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:05,297
Oh! And it sounds

667
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:07,550
- like it's moving, so...
- Move it!

668
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,633
Come on! Come on!

669
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:10,844
- Let's go!
- Careful!

670
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:14,181
And as they drove, they learned
so much about each other.

671
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:16,641
I was always just
in such a rush to grow up

672
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:19,019
and change this world,
and foolishly,

673
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:21,397
the teeth I pulled
were my adult teeth,

674
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:24,191
so this guy all the way
to that guy back there,

675
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,485
that's a... just a piece
of wood I stick in there.

676
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:27,945
I mean, they're just
chewing tools.

677
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,696
I don't care about looks.

678
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,949
But you find me pretty,
though, right?

679
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,242
No.

680
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:34,910
I have no idea
what you look like.

681
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:36,703
I have this condition
called face blindness.

682
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:38,747
I mean, I can tell
you're a woman.

683
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,165
Oh, stop.

684
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:42,667
But, honestly, no,
all I see is, like,

685
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:46,130
eyes and nose, you know,
hair, ears and...

686
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:48,549
But I can tell you got
a great heart, Lindsay.

687
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,593
I can tell
you've been living a lie.

688
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,886
You and I are going to change
this world together.

689
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,390
You know, my shaman

690
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:58,641
told me that I should stop
caring about appearances.

691
00:24:58,683 --> 00:25:02,229
You know, my whole life, that's
all anyone has ever praised.

692
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,647
All my mom ever cared about.

693
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,775
Because I'm really pretty.

694
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:10,028
I just thought I'd tell you that
so the story made sense.

695
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,864
- I don't care.
- But I guess it's kind of karma

696
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:15,534
that I ended up with someone
who wanted to make love to me

697
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:16,952
no matter what I look like.

698
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,121
Also wanted to make sure
you weren't a dude.

699
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:22,291
I can tell with voices usually,
but some guys, they'll...

700
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,294
they'll fool you
if that's what they want to do.

701
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:27,463
Hey...

702
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,550
Are you smiling at me?

703
00:25:31,592 --> 00:25:33,302
Lindsay decided
it was only fair

704
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:35,262
to let her husband know

705
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:37,515
their new start
had reached a new end.

706
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:38,932
I left.

707
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:40,142
I guess you noticed.

708
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,852
Um, look, I'm sorry.

709
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:45,564
I-I really do care about you,
Tobias, but we were trying

710
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:48,442
to save something
that just couldn't be saved.

711
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:51,612
And I have to follow
my shaman's advice. I...

712
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:56,116
I have to be true
to myself for once.

713
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:59,911
And Marky, he sees me
for who I really am.

714
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:02,039
- He respects me and...
- Come on, lady!

715
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,415
You want to wrap this up?

716
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:05,167
My lady needs to call
her loser ex.

717
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:07,336
Marky, it's me.

718
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:08,920
It's Lindsay.

719
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,048
Oh.

720
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,466
I thought you
were taking a dump.

721
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:13,551
Oh, I must have
scared the

722
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:15,135
off that lady in the bathroom

723
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:18,430
when I threw the door open
and told her I loved her.

724
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,184
He loves me?

725
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:23,768
Sorry. False alarm.

726
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,270
- I don't love you.
- Uh, I got to go.

727
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:27,064
Can you delete this
so I can leave

728
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:28,607
- a message for Maeby?
- It's good. She's fine.

729
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:30,609
And soon, the lovers arrived

730
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,571
and discovered the joys
of their new desert home,

731
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:36,699
dancing and making love
all night.

732
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,826
Now, that time...

733
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:41,704
was also very quick.

734
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:45,290
And now we've freed the night up
to dance again.

735
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:46,542
- Come on.
- Oh. Okay.

736
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,043
And the next day,

737
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,920
Lindsay awoke
to discover the destiny

738
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:53,924
foretold to her in India
in drab colors before her.

739
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:55,884
Get away from her.

740
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:57,010
Don't mess with her!

741
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:58,220
She's none of your business.

742
00:26:58,262 --> 00:26:59,930
Thank you.

743
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,015
I said get away from her,
you slut!

744
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:02,974
You're scaring the bird.

745
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:04,518
No, no, Mom.

746
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,228
Mom, she's with us.

747
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,313
She lives with us now.

748
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:11,650
And, Mom,
she tells me she's pretty.

749
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:14,737
I have the worst  shaman.

750
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:26,164
The defense calls to the
oyster bar thing where they sit

751
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:27,916
the adopted daughter,
Lindsay Bluth.

752
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,461
Another chair is empty

753
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:32,003
- at Lucille's trial.
- Lindsay...

754
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,880
Mr. Zuckerkorn,

755
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:37,008
Shrimp-Shooter Nights
starts in 15 minutes.

756
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,260
Is your witness going to appear?

757
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:40,304
"Appear."

758
00:27:40,345 --> 00:27:43,390
Oh, I thought the one
on the pier was a Bubba Gump's.

759
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:47,352
And, in an effort
to be less glamorous,

760
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:50,397
Lindsay cuts her hair
only to discover,

761
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:53,108
- much to her frustration...
- Great. Even cuter.

762
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,193
And Tobias becomes addicted

763
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:58,071
- to his new profession.
- I'm an addict, and I'm starving.

764
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:00,407
Yes, you are starving,
so would you like some butter?

765
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:01,784
I could give you some butter,

766
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,703
and, uh, you can pay for it
w-with a shoe.

767
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,455
Um... I'm sorry, but, uh,

768
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:08,999
his guy's not giving my guy
anything, uh, to react to.

769
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,543
Uh, could I get some more
of that, uh, acting juice?

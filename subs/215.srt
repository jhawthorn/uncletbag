1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,121
<i>Michael Bluth</i>
<i>hadjust been stunned to discover...</i>

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:27,489
<i>that a contract his company was</i>
<i>counting on was being cut back.</i>

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,394
<i>You initially told us to design and build</i>
<i>22 homes. Now you're saying 18.</i>

8
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,261
That doesn't give us enough
capital to complete the job.

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,800
And we've already got the blueprints
drawn up and everything.

10
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,564
<i>Well, that part wasn't true.</i>
<i>But they would've.</i>

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,037
That was a very important phone call.

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,907
I don't have much time, Michael. Tobias is
about to walk in here any minute asking for a job.

13
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,911
I need you to hire him.

14
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,811
- Hi. I'm sor-
- Look, it isn't my idea, it's his.

15
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,077
But I need a break
from Mrs. Featherbottom.

16
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,281
<i>Since moving out, Tobias had</i>
<i>been pretending to be a British housekeeper...</i>

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,085
<i>as a way to be close to his family.</i>

18
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,753
<i>However, his desire to now be discovered</i>
<i>as himself was becoming bothersome.</i>

19
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,457
<i>Can't you just tell him you know</i>
<i>that he's Mrs. Featherbottom?</i>

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,500
No. She's the only one
who can hand wash my delicates.

21
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,501
Yeah, the real Tobias
wouldn't do that.

22
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,367
- Wouldn't do what?
- Be Michael's assistant.

23
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,499
Well, that's what I came
down here to ask about.

24
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,839
<i>I think you'll find me</i>
<i>more than qualified.</i>

25
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,641
It's really not that simple.
Uh, you'd have to submit a résumé.

26
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,717
Booyah!

27
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,286
- <i>Wow. Gobias Industries.</i>
- Gobias.

28
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,855
- Right. I remember, yeah.
- As in "Go buy us a cup of-"

29
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,890
It looks like you might be
a little too qualified.

30
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:37,520
Hang on. Why don't you let your new
assistant take all this down?

31
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,154
<i>Wow, you are gung ho.</i>

32
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,723
You're getting a new assistant?
Is this because the order was cut back?

33
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,396
No. But if you are concerned
about keeping your job...

34
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,336
focus on keeping
unwanted visitors out of my office.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,467
I have rabies, Michael. You know that.
Today was day four of my shots.

36
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,637
<i>Starla had been bitten by...</i>

37
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,941
<i>a well-known music producer's guard dog.</i>

38
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,981
Michael, Starla told us
about the cutback.

39
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,681
You know, a lot of our overhead
is tied up in the fact...

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,655
we are on the top floor
of a very expensive building.

41
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,750
- If we move just one floor lower-
- Ted, everything's fine.

42
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,422
I got it all under control,
and nobody needs to move.

43
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,159
- I'm sorry. Ted, is it?
- Yes.

44
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,030
Ted. Did Ted make an appointment?

45
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,161
- No, I just work down the hall and-
- <i>No.</i>

46
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,001
Well, then, Ted can get
the hell out of this office!

47
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,907
- I'm talking-
- You get the hell out!

48
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,037
- And that's how you keep out unwanted visitors.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,311
<i>Although, if I may, let me</i>
<i>take off my assistant skirt...</i>

50
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:37,287
and put on my Barbra Streisand in <i>The Prince</i>
<i>of Tides</i> ass-masking therapist pantsuit.

51
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,154
- What?
- The reason that you can't accept my help...

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,127
is the same reason you can't
hear that gentleman's idea-

53
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,756
because you have to be in
total control of everything.

54
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,733
And it's going to make
you sick if you can't let go.

55
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,134
- Hey, I'm fine.
- Oh?

56
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,207
Oh! Ooh!
- <i>See? He's right.</i>
<i>You've got a control problem.</i>

57
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,436
<i>But I know this Eastern medicine store,</i>
<i>Ancient Chinese Secret.</i>

58
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,877
Ancient Chinese Secret, huh?

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,972
- I sent Gob there for his migraines.
- It's just a cramp. I'm fine.

60
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,746
<i>In fact, Gob was at Ancient</i>
<i>Chinese Secret at that moment...</i>

61
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,518
- <i>but not for a migraine.</i>
- Yeah, I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,753
Me quick, want slow.
Wait, that's Indian.

63
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:20,060
Tea for dong.

64
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:24,227
- Sweet blade.
- It's the Sword of Destiny. It's full of ancient magic.

65
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,635
Oh, yeah?
You into magic?

66
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,809
Still, where'd the lighter fluid come from?

67
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,811
- So, is it for sale? I could use it in my act.
- Maybe.

68
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,814
Sword of Destiny hundreds of years old.

69
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,578
Come with ancient story
of warning and-

70
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,814
Yeah, I make up my own patter.
Just ring it up with the dong tea.

71
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,822
<i>And Gob caught up with Michael.</i>

72
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:50,260
- Michael. Been lookin' for you.
- Looks like you're looking for dragons,
in the future.

73
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,923
I wouldn't mock
the Sword of Destiny, Michael.

74
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,330
Careful with that, Gob.

75
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,300
- Bleeding?
- Nope.

76
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,668
Yeah, that's blood.
It'll get better before the show.

77
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,468
That's what I need you for, Michael.

78
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,509
I can't perform my illusion
at the Gothic Castle...

79
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,704
because I've been banned
from the Magicians' Alliance.

80
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:11,113
I need you to register as the magician,
and I'm the lowly assistant.

81
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,983
Then we get on the stage,
and you ram the Sword of Destiny into my belly.

82
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,886
- What do you think?
- Really picked up steam there
at the end, but I can't.

83
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,256
I've gotta teach George Michael how to drive.
And then I gotta get right back here, because-

84
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,056
Michael, if I make this comeback...

85
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,289
I'll buy you 100 George Michaels
you can teach to drive!

86
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,299
- You're losing blood, aren't you?
- Probably. My socks are wet.

87
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,301
Sorry.

88
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,930
You'll be sorry!
Wait, that doesn't work after his line.

89
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,975
<i>And Michael rushed home</i>
<i>to teach his son to drive.</i>

90
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,670
<i>Knock, knock. Hey, Maeby.</i>
<i>George Michael, ready to drive?</i>

91
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,304
- <i>I don't have much time.</i>
- Get me behind that wheel.

92
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,315
Oh, no, you will
not be behind the wheel.

93
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,908
You'll observe me while
I demonstrate some things, okay?

94
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,217
I'll be quizzing you too, hotshot.
I'm gonna go grab the video camera.

95
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,848
- And then, school's in.
- I'd skip.

96
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,824
Well, no, I need to learn.

97
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,827
You can't get around
anywhere without a driver's license.

98
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:01,161
<i>Actually, Maeby had received</i>
<i>a company car from the movie studio...</i>

99
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,498
<i>where she was secretly</i>
<i>posing as an executive.</i>

100
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:17,011
<i>But currently, George Sr.</i>
<i>Was in the attic making a videotape</i>-

101
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,051
- This is my demand.
- <i>when Michael found him.</i>

102
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,383
What's the deal with the turban?

103
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,321
Huh?
Pretty smart, huh?

104
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,087
- And-And it's warm too.
- Guess that makes sense.

105
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,686
Oh, hey, I heard about that reduced order.
Those bastards.

106
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,790
This videotape is for our employees.

107
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:40,066
You take this and play it. This will
reassure them that someone is in charge.

108
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,540
Well, someone is in charge, Dad.
I'm in charge. I've never even taken a sick day.

109
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,543
No, a real authority.

110
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,136
My presence needs to be, uh, reinstated.

111
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,410
<i>His first effort at doing so</i>
<i>had already failed.</i>

112
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,042
When do you start
being my mole at my company?

113
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,383
Actually, Michael turned me
down for the job.

114
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,050
- What?
- Something to do with their
housing order being cut back.

115
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,459
Oh, my God, that's a horrible sign-
Ow! Damn it!

116
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,556
<i>I'm the authority,</i>
<i>so I will save the company.</i>

117
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,500
And I say no videotape. Ooh!

118
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,903
- You oughta take a sick day. Get out of that office.
- Don't count on it, Dad.

119
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,101
<i>And Michael was finally ready</i>
<i>to make his son watch him drive.</i>

120
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,147
All right, stair car basics. In order to
get this thing up to a minimum speed...

121
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,615
you gotta jam on the gas pedal
for about a minute, okay?

122
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,618
But in order to slow this thing down...

123
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,620
you gotta get immediately
back on the brake pedal...

124
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,553
'cause you got about
two tons of stairs behind you.

125
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,182
We're gonna cover the hydraulic flaps
and the riser system...

126
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,488
after I tell you the basics
about how to avoid a hop-on.

127
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,032
But the first thing
we're gonna go over- Ow!

128
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,194
<i>And that's when Michael decided</i>
<i>that perhaps it was time for a sick day.</i>

129
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,636
<i>Let's go over the route</i>
<i>to the hospital. Ow!</i>

130
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,608
My baby is sick,
but Mother is here to nurse you.

131
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,238
- Well, now I'm a little sicker.
- Well, don't you worry about work today.

132
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,681
I am ready and willing
to step up and take over.

133
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,310
Yeah, and I'll get George Michael
ready for his driving test.

134
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,289
I'm gonna teach him when I get out. And no
one's taking over for me at the Bluth Company.

135
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,953
Michael, this is what we talked about.
I'm sure they'll do just fine without you.

136
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,326
<i>Well, you're wrong,</i>
<i>because we're in crisis there.</i>

137
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,265
They need to know that
I'm in charge and I'm in con-

138
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,962
I'm peeing.
Am I peeing?

139
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,595
I'm sorry. We gave you a little
something to relax you.

140
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,674
It may have taken the tingle out
of your genitals.

141
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,471
Oh, no. You're not
taking care of my son.

142
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,638
I'm sorry to say this, but it's too late
for me to do anything for your son.

143
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,816
Let him keep talking.

144
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,410
Because Dr. Stein here has already
been assigned to his case.

145
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:39,184
- You're lucky. He's the best.
- Well, only in the county.

146
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,193
But I'm certainly good enough to
take out that appendix of yours.

147
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,492
- Appendix?
- I don't buy it. Could be a hernia.

148
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,657
<i>Or it could be your colon.</i>

149
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,167
I'd want to get in there
and find some answers.

150
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,567
<i>Well, I am the best doctor</i>
<i>in the state.</i>

151
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,572
But if you don't trust my decisions-

152
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,699
No, no, no. No. You're the doctor.
You see, he's the authority here.

153
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,440
<i>We need to respect him just like the employees</i>
<i>at the Bluth Company need to respect me.</i>

154
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:06,040
Okay, I'm going to put you on this machine
to slow down your heart rate.

155
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:11,283
<i>Hopefully not too slow, because</i>
<i>it's already dangerously slow as it is.</i>

156
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,416
Whatever you think, Doctor.

157
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,520
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was still trying</i>
<i>to arrange his comeback in magic.</i>

158
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,690
So I'd be a magician
and you'd be my assistant?

159
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Well, on paper, yes.

160
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,465
But once the show starts,
and you ram that sword through my belly...

161
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,905
people will know that I'm the one
who belongs back in the Alliance.

162
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,842
The kind of trick that I can put on a DVD,
like Tony Wonder does.

163
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,905
<i>Tony Wonder had startled the</i>
<i>world by baking himself into a loaf ofbread.</i>

164
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,247
<i>He sold the DVD's of it on his Web site...</i>

165
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,221
<i>which many claimed suffered</i>
<i>due to its pop-up ads.</i>
- <i>Thanks.</i>

166
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,622
I'm finally being treated like a real person,
not some deformed-

167
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,890
Hook! Forgot about
that thing, Elephant Man.

168
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,488
Gonna have to figure out something to do
so that people can look at you...

169
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,567
without wanting to kill themselves.

170
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,933
<i>That night, George Sr.</i>
<i>Heard about Michael's illness.</i>

171
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,802
The employees are gonna panic.
They need to know that someone's in control.

172
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,105
- And how do we do that?
- Booyah!

173
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,044
<i>And at the Gothic Castle...</i>

174
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,742
- <i>Buster had been outfitted with</i>
<i>a mechanical Halloween hand.</i>
- Whoa!

175
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,752
Looks like you've got some dirty ears.

176
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,118
Well, you're not on the banned list,
so you can go on at 6:00.

177
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,987
<i>6:00? Looks like you'll be my opener.</i>

178
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,994
Tony Wonder!

179
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,866
You like bread?

180
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,498
- Yeah.
- Have some.

181
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,510
- Wow, it's warm.
- How did you do that?

182
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,137
Oh, ho, ho.
Magicians only.

183
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,684
I folded it up into some squares,
and I put it in a pouch under my shirt...

184
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,686
and then I pull it out, and I make it
look like it came out of my skin.

185
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,222
- Wow, that sounds easy.
- Keep it to yourself.

186
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,816
And good luck up there tonight.
And you! You'll get there someday.

187
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,452
I started out as a little "W."
Somehow I became a big one.

188
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,463
I don't even know how
it happened. All right?

189
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,038
My eye!

190
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,675
Enjoy the Hanukkah cookie, man.

191
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,316
What a cool guy.

192
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,754
<i>- Tobias had been sent to the office by George Sr.</i>
- My name is Dr. Tobias Fünke...

193
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,817
<i>and I'll be filling in for Michael,</i>
<i>who is not sick.</i>

194
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,524
In fact, just today I saw
a sliver of his buttocks...

195
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,864
and they're as fresh and firm
as a Georgia peach, so not to worry.

196
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,338
But before you all rise up and say,
"Well, let's make this man our leader,"

197
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,501
<i>well, I think that won't be</i>
<i>necessary after you see this.</i>

198
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,511
Is this right?

199
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,912
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay had</i>
<i>also violated Michael's authority...</i>

200
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,917
<i>and was teaching</i>
<i>George Michael to drive.</i>

201
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,953
Sure you don't want me
to watch you for a while?

202
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,684
Driving is about confidence, George Michael.
Jam on it! It feels great, right?

203
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,250
Now, put your foot on the brake.
There's a light in a half mile.

204
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,058
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Buster and Gob had begun...</i>

205
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,657
<i>the Sword of Destiny illusion</i>
<i>at the Gothic Castle.</i>

206
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:18,042
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah! Ooh! Whoo!

207
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,044
Stop it, Buster.

208
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,943
- And now our magic trick.
- Illusion.

209
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,039
Silence, slave!

210
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,143
In this magic trick,
I'm going to put a sword...

211
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,451
- through my assistant's tummy.
- No patter.

212
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,924
May I have the trick sword, please?

213
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,053
It's a real sword, master.

214
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,565
Oh-ho!

215
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,234
- Ooh! Hoo, hoo, hoo!
- We've got 'em. I'm gonna milk this for a minute.

216
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,900
Okay.

217
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,240
My hand! My hand!

218
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,419
<i>And the audience wasn't</i>
<i>the only one impressed by the performance.</i>

219
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,399
Bravo. Hey, give us a sec,
would you, Candida?

220
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,034
My brother's widow.
It's- up.

221
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,440
Hey, so the accident angle.
Right on.

222
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,774
- Oh, thank you, very much.
- <i>No, thank you.</i>

223
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,780
The "How'd he do dats?" ate it up.

224
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,611
Sorry. That's what we call the audience.

225
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,880
No, l-I know- I know about all that.
Used to have a solo act.

226
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,784
There was talk of boiling me
into a bisque at one point.

227
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,347
Not registering. But you hitched
your wagon to the right star.

228
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,190
- I want you guys on my next DVD.
- You want us for <i>Use Your Illusion?</i>

229
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,196
Actually, some band has
got the rights to that title.

230
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,198
So, I'm thinkin', like,
<i>Use Your Illusion II.</i>

231
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,633
But, yeah, meet me out there tomorrow.
And, uh, if you get thirsty-

232
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:06,312
Have a free round of drinks,
courtesy ofTony Wonder.

233
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,149
- It's a Subway Sub Club card.
- That's a magician.

234
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,224
Oh, it still needs three stamps.

235
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,225
<i>Michael hadjust come</i>
<i>around from his appendectomy.</i>

236
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,659
Give me the phone. I want to call
George Michael, tell him I'm okay.

237
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,095
He's on his way here.
We passed him on the road.

238
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,396
He was doing really well.
Had his first hop-on.

239
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,164
What are you talking about?
He's driving? I told Lindsay not to teach him.

240
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,332
- I was going to videotape that hop-on.
- Hey, Dad. How're you feeling?

241
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,672
Bad, George Michael. I just found out
Lindsay's teaching you how to drive.

242
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,680
Yeah. She's still trying to get the stairs
unwedged from the emergency room overhang.

243
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,240
I was gonna teach you. Just forget
everything she told you, and we'll start over.

244
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,252
Oh, for God's sake.
Tobias is right.

245
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,254
- What?
- You have to control everyone's life.

246
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,689
I don't know where you get that from.
Oscar, stop licking that sore.

247
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,456
- I'm not.
- Well, the operation went pretty smoothly.

248
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,967
<i>But once I got in there,</i>
<i>the appendix wasn't so inflamed. D'oh.</i>

249
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,901
- I knew it.
- Okay. Well, can we get me out of here?

250
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,201
I gotta retrain my son how to drive,
and I need to stop by the office...

251
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,471
- to make sure my business doesn't go to hell.
- And, not so fast, Michael.

252
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,274
There seems to be a bacterial infection
from the operation...

253
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,874
- which left an abscess in your abdominal wall.
- Ew.

254
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,146
I know, it's pretty gross.
It could heal on its own.

255
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:20,624
<i>But I say we go in there</i>
<i>Dr. Stein-style and cut it out.</i>

256
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,753
I want to show these interns what
the best doctor in Southern California can do.

257
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,664
- Well, I respect your decision.
- I'll check on you soon.

258
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,329
Michael, this crazy point you're trying to
make about respecting authority is absurd.

259
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,967
And one day, you're gonna wake up and find
out it has caused you nothing but trouble.

260
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:42,309
- And you are peeing again.
- <i>And as the anesthesia took hold...</i>

261
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,474
<i>Michael realized he was going to</i>
<i>wake up to nothing but trouble.</i>

262
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:50,214
The F.B.I. Has pinpointed the location
of escaped convict George Bluth today...

263
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:54,759
<i>thanks to a tape turned in by a rabid</i>
<i>and disgruntled employee.</i>

264
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,594
The F.B.I. Has matched the design of the attic
to one of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi houses.

265
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,465
- And it appears his son is with him.
- This is my demand.

266
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,664
Booyah!

267
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,105
<i>Buster and Gob were</i>
<i>waiting to meet with Tony Wonder.</i>

268
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,378
All right. He's gonna lowball us, so just
let me do the talking, all right, Busty?

269
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,613
This DVD is the destiny
the sword has chosen for me.

270
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,519
I wonder where he is.

271
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,821
Did somebody say, "Wonder"?

272
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,456
He just appeared out of nowhere,
in front of that dumbwaiter.

273
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,296
<i>Actually, he'd been hiding inside</i>
<i>the dumbwaiter for over 20 minutes...</i>

274
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:41,533
- <i>waiting for someone to use the word "wonder."</i>
- <i>I wonder where he is.</i>

275
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,972
Oh, hey, you've got a piece
of lettuce on your shoulder.

276
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,101
Ta-da!

277
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,511
Part of the trick.
So, let's get down to business, shall we?

278
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,176
Hey, can you, uh, go wait with
the other assistants over there?

279
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,584
- What?
- No, whatever you say to me, you can say to him.

280
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,090
I grant him magic sanctuary.

281
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,650
Uh, you grant me? Come on,
you can't just make up-
- <i>That's fine.</i>

282
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,323
I second the sanctuary.
But with a clause of silence.

283
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,096
So, I want you guys to be on <i>Use Your Illusion.</i>
Only now it's "Allusion" with an "A."

284
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,933
So if you guys want to put
an allusion in there somewhere...

285
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,372
like, you know, Poe or something or-
Don't do Poe, 'cause I'm doin' Poe.

286
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,706
- What about Chaucer?
- Just not Poe, okay?

287
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,215
And, uh, I don't think
we need, uh, your assistant.

288
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,513
- What?
- Eh! Clause of silence.

289
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,955
Look, my assistant is my partner.
I need him.

290
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,255
For what, Buster, huh?
You're the magic.

291
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,820
Check out those moves you're doin', man.
They're in their own orbit.

292
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,900
Look at Tiagra, my girl.
Don't look at her.

293
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,402
'Cause you look at her and it affects her
in a way that I don't feel comfortable with.

294
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,371
Or go for it. I don't care, whatever.
I'm just sayin' it's your world.

295
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,806
All right, you know what?
The trick is on you, Tony Wonder.

296
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:55,312
I'm the magician. He's the assistant.
We don't need him!

297
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,874
The real Sword of Destiny trick
hasn't even been performed yet. Ta-da!

298
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,715
<i>Whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>whoa, whoa. Wait.</i>

299
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,222
Are you tellin' me that you have a
multi-stage trick with hidden identities?

300
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,783
<i>That's right. And I'm gonna perform</i>
<i>the real trick this afternoon.</i>

301
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,591
- I guess we'll see what <i>you</i> can do then.
- <i>I guess we will.</i>

302
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:25,509
Ow! Darryl, I told you to move that-
chair 10 times!

303
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,079
And clean the-
Dumbwaiter while you're at it!

304
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,149
Oh, I was really hoping
for a graham cracker.

305
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,445
That would have been
a good spot for a trick.

306
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,816
- <i>Michael awoke from his second surgery.</i>
- Morning, sleepyhead.

307
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,288
- Did you get the abscess?
- Well, uh, we had a little whoopsie.

308
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,521
See, we got the abscess, but I think
we might have left some snippers in there.

309
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:48,760
It's not very likely, but one of the assistants
having taken them is even less likely.

310
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:53,736
- Unless I left them in my scrubs.
- <i>Michael, good news.</i>

311
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,774
They think George is in Iraq.
All the pressure's off him.

312
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,367
That was on the news?
I thought that I dreamt that.

313
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,505
- Oh, they're gonna think that I'm there. Ow!
- But not to worry.

314
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,947
Tobias said he's handling it
with the F.B. I<i>...</i>

315
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,542
and the employees have
everything under control.

316
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,554
No, that's the worst thing possible.

317
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,715
They think the company's in trouble
and that I'm in Iraq.

318
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,725
I gotta get down there.
I need your car keys.

319
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,853
<i>And so Michael</i>
<i>and George Michael headed to the office.</i>

320
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,625
- Right here, gentlemen.
- <i>Which is how Tobias missed him.</i>

321
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:24,964
Michael Bluth is not... in Iraq.

322
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,564
<i>Michael, back to bed with you.</i>
<i>You look awful.</i>

323
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:35,545
<i>Michael rushed to the office</i>
<i>only to find that his worst fears had come true.</i>

324
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,741
We're too late. It's gone.
Everybody said that I was too controlling...

325
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,253
but I walk away for one minute,
look what happens to the company.

326
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,289
I mean, this is why
I didn't want- Damn it!

327
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,290
Dad, you should probably take it easy.

328
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,589
I said that this would happen. I said respect
my authority, but no one would listen.

329
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,630
Everybody had
their own better id- Ow!

330
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,724
<i>And maybe it was the stress</i>
<i>or even the misplaced snippers...</i>

331
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,860
<i>but Michael had never felt worse.</i>

332
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,499
<i>However, thanks to taking on his authority,</i>
<i>the employees had never felt better.</i>

333
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,975
- Ted?
- Oh, hey, Michael. Good news.

334
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,410
We leased the top floor to another company
and moved down here.

335
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,711
But we can stay in business
without having to build the extra houses.

336
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,012
We did it.
We did it!

337
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,015
- You're goin' down, right?
<i>- Whoo!</i>

338
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,891
<i>And back at the Gothic Castle,</i>
<i>Gob was performing his illusion.</i>

339
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,695
Hey, after I cut the candle in half,
switch out the real sword for the fake one.

340
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,394
What are you doin'?
I'm Gob Bluth.

341
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,837
I'm the real magician.
This man is only the assistant.

342
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,274
Buster, the sword.

343
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,046
Handle first. Handle first.

344
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,776
<i>Oh, my fingers!</i>

345
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,318
He cut off my-
fingers!

346
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,945
- Oh!
- No!

347
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,752
- Guy is good. Damn good.
<i>- Bravo!</i>

348
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,557
<i>I'm not kidding!</i>
<i>He cut off my- fingers!</i>

349
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,067
- I didn't know we had taquitos.
<i>- More! More!</i>

350
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,068
<i>And Michael came to a decision.</i>

351
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,161
You know what, George Michael?

352
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:12,608
I think I'm going to give up
some of my authority, starting now.

353
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,373
You drive home. All right?

354
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,449
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Michael's decision to let his son...</i>

355
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,782
<i>drive a car with a more</i>
<i>responsive gas pedal...</i>

356
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,119
<i>was not a good decision.</i>

357
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,988
Your leg's gonna be fine, Michael.

358
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,857
<i>And I wouldn't worry about</i>
<i>getting hit by any more cars.</i>

359
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,626
I've shortened your calf muscles to
theoretically increase your jumping ability.

360
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,294
<i>But if it works,</i>
<i>I could be the best in the world.</i>

361
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,871
I want the other doctor back.

362
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,771
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

363
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,107
- <i>Michael gets a new roommate.</i>
- Your fingers have been perfectly reattached.

364
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,443
Go ahead, take a look.

365
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,044
My middle finger
and index finger are-

366
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,053
Switched for the first time ever.

367
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,623
- Nice job, Frank.
- Amazing.

368
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,661
<i>And the F.B.I. Finds footage more</i>
<i>troublesome than they'd originally thought.</i>

369
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,788
It appears there was
something else on the videotape.

370
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,799
We think it's a terrorist training film.

371
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:14,338
You're not half the man he was!

372
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,033
This kid's got moves.

1
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,134
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,465
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:09,732
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,041
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:25,211
<i>Michael Bluth</i>
<i>always rode his bike to work...</i>

6
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:27,882
<i>but the recent heat wave had</i>
<i>taken some of the fun out of it.</i>

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,186
<i>It had also caused problems...</i>

8
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:33,990
<i>in his presentation to</i>
<i>the Bluth Company investors.</i>

9
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:36,793
There's no screwups
with the permits this time?

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,130
The permits have been filed
absolutely on time.

11
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:41,067
You have my word on that.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,567
Um, I'll tell you what.

13
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:48,405
Let me get some of this, uh...

14
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:51,003
Well, as you can...
The important part is here.

15
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,139
- Bye, you guys. Really great to see you again.
- Bye.

16
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,280
They think you're full of...

17
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:02,688
- I think it's the sweating.
- I've gotta get a car.

18
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:05,124
Don't worry.
I told them the truth.

19
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,788
- That I rode here on a bike?
- That the permits weren't filed.

20
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:11,698
But my dad filed the permits
before he went to jail.

21
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,201
He most certainly did not.

22
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:16,363
So, I just lied
to the investors?

23
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,941
- You most certainly did.
- That's really great.

24
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:22,034
Now I gotta ride my bike out to
the prison and talk to my dad about this.

25
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,942
That'll be fun
in 100-degree heat.

26
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:26,208
Why don't you take
your dad's car?

27
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:30,150
No. Dad would never go for that.

28
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:34,053
No, no, no, no.
There's no ice cream in the car.

29
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:37,320
- I'll be careful.
- All right. This is what we're gonna do.

30
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:39,452
Careful, Michael.

31
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:45,123
Oh.

32
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,038
- <i>Whatever you think.</i>
- Yeah.

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,631
But I did see Gob
driving it last week.

34
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:55,472
<i>Wait. Honestly,</i>
<i>Gob's driving the car?</i>

35
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,207
I'm not the liar.

36
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:01,045
<i>Michael needed his father's car...</i>

37
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:03,449
<i>so he went to confront</i>
<i>his brother Gob.</i>

38
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:06,181
- Give me a Gob.
- Gob!

39
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,223
No, I didn't mean for you
to yell my name at me.

40
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,225
It's what I call a double-dipped banana
with everything on it.

41
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:13,524
<i>Hey, I can't believe you.</i>
<i>I asked you two weeks ago...</i>

42
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,064
whether we should use Dad's car,
and you said it would be bad form.

43
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,603
- Now I hear you're driving it.
- That is a lie, a bold-faced lie!

44
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:23,867
<i>Gob was lying.</i>
<i>He had been driving his father's car.</i>

45
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,189
Why don't you just take
your precious, portable...

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,191
stairway vehicle you're always trying
to convince us is a car?

47
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,386
Yeah, that would be great,
except our brother-in-law...

48
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,395
left it in
an airport parking lot.

49
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,192
From whence it came, huh?

50
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,530
<i>In fact, Tobias had intended</i>
<i>to park the family's only vehicle...</i>

51
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:54,536
<i>at the airport parking lot...</i>

52
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:57,732
<i>but was waved on</i>
<i>to the tarmac instead...</i>

53
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,139
<i>where he found a spot</i>
<i>close to his gate.</i>

54
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,970
Here you go, Uncle Gob.
I had to use two sticks...

55
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,015
to support all
the extra chocolate and nuts.

56
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,608
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
Two sticks and extra chocolate?

57
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,812
Is it Mardi Gras?
What are you charging for that?

58
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,549
- He doesn't like to discuss money.
- I don't like to discuss money.

59
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:18,150
- You don't pay for it?
- A Bluth banana? No, I hadn't planned on it.

60
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,126
But I'll tell you what...
if you want to use my likeness...

61
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,130
for a Hamburglar-type character...

62
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,792
I'll sign off on that,
Mr. Banana-Grabber.

63
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,927
No, no, no, no, no. No more banana grabbing.
No more car grabbing.

64
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:31,337
- Throw that away, please.
- But it's already made.

65
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:33,671
I don't care.
Nobody gets it now, okay?

66
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:39,615
- Are you happy?
- My own brother, Michael.

67
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:43,183
My own selfish brother.

68
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,021
- Michael.
- All right.

69
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:52,789
I do not want you to get upset.
He did not mean that.

70
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,763
- Sometimes he says...
- Selfish Michael.

71
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,869
He did not mean that either.

72
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:06,305
<i>Michael then went to his sister</i>
<i>to find his father's car.</i>

73
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,138
What car? I don't know
what you're talking about.

74
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:11,042
Dad's car. The one you
didn't tell me that you had...

75
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:13,809
even though I had to ride
my bicycle to work all week.

76
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,885
Oh, Dad's car.

77
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,681
Well, obviously, I'm gonna use it
if it's an emergency.

78
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:21,689
<i>Lindsay had such an emergency</i>
<i>three days earlier...</i>

79
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,557
<i>when her salon was able to squeeze</i>
<i>her in at the last moment.</i>

80
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,462
That color's discontinued!

81
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,034
I have to get ready
for the bachelorette auction.

82
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:34,262
The bachelorette auction?
You know you're married.

83
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,565
<i>You just go to dinner with the guy.</i>
<i>It's for charity.</i>

84
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:39,801
That's what you said about posing
for the Ladies of Literacy Calendar.

85
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,673
The one with the pictures of all
the 30-year-old women in lingerie...

86
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,942
with their nipples covered
by copies of <i>Oliver Twist.</i>

87
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,108
Yeah, that made a big difference
for the young ones.

88
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:50,482
It would have if it didn't
get banned from the schools.

89
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:53,078
Come on, face it. You do all this
charity crap just to stroke your ego.

90
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,089
You don't even know
what the auction's for tonight.

91
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:58,649
- The wetlands.
- To do what with them?

92
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:01,162
- Dry them.
- Save them.

93
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,698
From drying. Which is more
than you would ever do.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,995
You're, like, the least
charitable person I know.

95
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:09,128
I don't do
anything for myself.

96
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,207
Everything that I do
is for this family.

97
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,207
<i>Oh, you don't do it</i>
<i>for us, Michael.</i>

98
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,709
You just do it because you love
being the guy in charge.

99
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:20,875
Cause you love saying no, like you said
to Gob when he wanted a frozen banana.

100
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:24,351
And even after he gave you the rights
to his Mr. Banana-Grabber character.

101
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:28,015
You know what? I will start doing my
charity work when you start doing yours.

102
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:31,184
In the meantime, where's the car?

103
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:33,694
I think Buster has it.
I don't know. It's on the schedule.

104
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:37,028
There is a schedule?

105
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:41,536
I always try so hard
not to look at this thing.

106
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:43,873
- <i>So Michael went to find Buster.</i>
- Who let you in?

107
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:44,771
- <i>So Michael went to find Buster.</i>
- Who let you in?

108
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:47,399
<i>Your new cleaning woman.</i>
<i>What happened to Luz?</i>

109
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,946
Supposedly, Luz had to take
her daughter to the hospital.

110
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,947
That's Lupe, her sister.

111
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,485
- God, I hope she's okay.
- She's awful. Can barely wash a dish.

112
00:05:56,586 --> 00:06:01,922
Uh-oh. She better not walk through here
after she's been in there.

113
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,726
- Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
- <i>Mother.</i>

114
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:05,421
- Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
- <i>Mother.</i>

115
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:09,555
Oh, please. They didn't sneak
into this country to be your friends.

116
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,930
Wow.

117
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:15,630
Don't you judge me.
You're the selfish one.

118
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:19,731
You're the one who charged his own
brother for a Bluth frozen banana.

119
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,743
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's one banana, Michael.</i>

120
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:23,904
<i>What could it cost, $ 10?</i>

121
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,914
You've never actually set foot
in a supermarket, have you?

122
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,643
I don't have time for this.

123
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,742
I've got to get ready
for the bachelorette auction.

124
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:33,652
You're doing that? You can't possibly
tell me that you care about the wetlands.

125
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:37,954
I care about going for more money
than Lucille Austero.

126
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,859
<i>In fact, Lucille Bluth</i>
<i>had made sure of that.</i>

127
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:44,331
- Lucille!
- I got you tickets to <i>The Producers.</i>

128
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,164
I already saw it
in New York.

129
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,367
But that's of no use to a woman whose vertigo
makes flying a grotesque misadventure.

130
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:56,434
You must have scrimped
and saved for these.

131
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,276
But isn't this
the night of the auction?

132
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:02,010
- Is it?
- You seem pretty confident.

133
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:04,018
Oh, I think there's
a certain bachelor...

134
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,782
who won't mind coming home
with me at the end of the evening.

135
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,189
- Buster.
- Where did he go?

136
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,784
Buster!

137
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,524
<i>Why do you hide</i>
<i>every time the doorbell rings?</i>

138
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:19,124
I'm not hiding.
- <i>Buster was hiding</i>
<i>from Lucille Austero.</i>

139
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:23,467
<i>After inadvertently flirting with her at</i>
<i>a social event while not wearing his glasses...</i>

140
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,939
<i>Lucille had been</i>
<i>pursuing him ever since.</i>

141
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,670
Buster, hi. It's me again.

142
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:33,010
<i>I've still got those</i> Producers <i>tickets,</i>
<i>and I'd love to share them with you.</i>

143
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:36,745
<i>I don't want you to think</i>
<i>I'm taking this more seriously than you...</i>

144
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:41,017
"are and unless you're planning
some grand romantic gesture...

145
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:44,560
my feelings are just
the teensiest bit hurt."

146
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,425
- What are you going to do?
- Bid on you.

147
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,327
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.

148
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:51,332
- When?
- When they call my name.

149
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:55,165
No, they're not going to call your name.
They're going to call my name.

150
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:59,071
<i>Good grief.</i>

151
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:02,770
Hey, Busty.
You been using Dad's car?

152
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,575
No. Uh, well, yes.

153
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:09,516
- You got the keys?
- Uh, probably in my school pants.

154
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,520
- Okay.
- I have been a part of this archeological dig.

155
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:17,025
- Hmm.
- I think we found a part of a pterodactyl
under Fashion Island.

156
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,754
Be careful.

157
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,095
Oh!

158
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,690
That was 90% gravity.

159
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:28,532
It is my day on the schedule,
but I guess you get them first.

160
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:31,869
- Yeah.
- Wait. I need my rape whistle back.

161
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,034
You got all your stuff out of the car?

162
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:37,579
Yeah, I left my, um, homework in
the backseat, but I can get it later.

163
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

164
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,483
Help.

165
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:45,247
<i>Michael surveyed the damage</i>
<i>to his father's car</i>...

166
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:49,451
<i>the partially excavated skull,</i>
<i>the spilled nail polish...</i>

167
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,756
<i>the burned seats.</i>.. <i>and he came to</i>
<i>an important decision.</i>

168
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:56,161
Well, I'm getting some ice cream...
I can tell you that right now.

169
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:01,966
<i>Michael, now able to drive to prison...</i>

170
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,971
<i>confronted his father</i>
<i>about the permits.</i>

171
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,633
How come you didn't tell me
that you didn't file them?

172
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,871
I'm under a lot of pressure. I'm trying
to get my newsletter off the ground...

173
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:13,813
and I'm trying to decide
which gang to align myself with.

174
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,884
- Is it pledge week already?
- I've got it down to two...

175
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,886
but, honestly, I just
don't even want to choose.

176
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:23,322
I just feel... I feel like
the prettiest girl at the dance.

177
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:25,951
Listen, about that permit thing,
that's an easy fix.

178
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:29,259
just break into the permit office, slip
the application into the next file...

179
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,993
then you tell them, you know,
"Hey, you guys screwed up."

180
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:35,537
- I'm not doing that, Dad.
- Michael, you lied to your investors.

181
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:38,801
You gotta make that right.
Call Gob.

182
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:41,502
He'll handle it. That's what...
That's what he's for.

183
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,511
<i>That's</i> what he's for.

184
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,446
You better tell him I'm asking.
I don't think he's gonna do it for you...

185
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,017
after you wouldn't even give him
a frozen banana, Michael?

186
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:51,848
- What is there, a chat room that you guys...
- That's not charitable.

187
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:54,684
Never mind. I'll tell Gob
that you want him to do this.

188
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,851
- Okay. I got a dance I gotta get ready for.
- Whoa. There's really a dance?

189
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,226
I don't know.
Both sides are making a lot of promises.

190
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,630
You should call this
a Gob, guy.

191
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,743
Gob, can I talk
to you for a sec?

192
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:20,645
Listen, um, I'm really sorry
about before.

193
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,719
I said some things,
and I got a little carried away.

194
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,482
It's not the way you're
supposed to treat a brother...

195
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,557
especially one
that I value so highly.

196
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:33,924
- Oh, I need a favor.
- That was subtle.

197
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,692
- Did you just whistle?
- I had to buy a candied apple...

198
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,267
when you denied me a banana, so, yeah,
I'm whistling.

199
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,997
- Satisfied?
- It's not that noticeable. Listen.

200
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:48,635
- Dad would like for you
to break into the permit office.
- Dad?

201
00:10:48,744 --> 00:10:51,110
- Dad said he wanted me for that?
- Yes, he did.

202
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:55,344
- Will you do it?
- Maybe. I have some conditions.

203
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:58,853
- Terms.
- Boy.

204
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,923
- One condition and one term.
- All right.

205
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:03,583
- Let's have the condition first.
- Free banana whenever I want.

206
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,491
- Single dip.
- Double dip, but I'll take one stick.

207
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,826
- All right. What else?
- Creative control...

208
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:11,399
spin-off rights
and theme park approval...

209
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,799
for Mr. Banana-Grabber,
Baby Banana-Grabber...

210
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,997
and any other Banana-Grabber family
character that might emanate therefrom.

211
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:19,939
I retain animation rights,
and we're gonna go back to single dip.

212
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,441
- Done.
- Great. What else?

213
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,478
You humiliated me
in front of my nephew.

214
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,638
I expect you to fix that.

215
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:28,683
I want the respect
of your son.

216
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:30,843
You better let me
do the talking.

217
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:34,218
<i>George Michael,</i>
<i>your uncle has a request.</i>

218
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:36,553
One Bluth banana,
George Michael.

219
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,560
<i>Go ahead, give it to him.</i>
<i>Gob deserves your respect.</i>

220
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:44,099
And from now on, I want you to do
whatever he asks you to do, okay?

221
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,139
After all, he is your uncle, and I think
we ought to just embrace that.

222
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:54,300
- Thank you.
- Have I held up my end of the deal?

223
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,378
I can't believe I gave you
animation rights.

224
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,573
I hope that doesn't come back
and bite me in the ass.

225
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:02,150
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay,</i>
<i>wanting to prove to Michael...</i>

226
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,981
<i>that she was a charitable person,</i>
<i>joined a group of activists...</i>

227
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,648
<i>dedicated to preserving</i>
<i>the wetlands.</i>

228
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,659
Yeah. Hi.
I'm gonna need a taxi.

229
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:15,822
I don't know if that smell
is you, the car...

230
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,900
something you ate or
something you're about to eat...

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,366
but my God, you're in
a service business!

232
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,669
- Hello.
- I'm in the wetlands.

233
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,902
I've got a poker thing,
and I'm gonna clean them up.

234
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,706
So the next time you wanna
tell me that I'm uncharitable...

235
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:33,680
why don't you just ask yourself
who called you from the wetlands?

236
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:36,616
- Who is this?
- Nice try. You're the selfish one.

237
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:40,314
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some nature to save.

238
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:49,191
<i>While Lindsay was finding</i>
<i>it difficult to be truly charitable...</i>

239
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:53,530
<i>Michael was looking for an opportunity</i>
<i>to rise to Lindsay's challenge...</i>

240
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:57,572
<i>and that's when he recognized his mother's</i>
<i>fill-in housekeeper at a bus stop.</i>

241
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:00,233
Hello there.
You're not riding the bus today.

242
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:03,210
Get in this car. I'm not taking no
for an answer. Come on.

243
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:05,212
Don't make me get out
of this car and put you in here myself.

244
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:07,282
- That's right. Here we go.
- <i>Unfortunately, the woman he picked up...</i>

245
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:10,113
<i>wasn't Lupe,</i>
<i>but was a total stranger.</i>

246
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:14,679
<i>And upon seeing bones, a shovel</i>
<i>and what appeared to be blood...</i>

247
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,826
<i>she realized he wasn't</i>
<i>who she thought he was.</i>

248
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:23,297
Mister, please.

249
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,232
This is gonna be tricky.
I don't speak Spanish.

250
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:28,769
<i>Yo</i> "escared."

251
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:31,863
- Uh-huh.
- <i>"Izquierdo."</i> I know that one.

252
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:36,775
Left turn it is, Mrs...
They call me selfish.

253
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:42,076
<i>Michael thought he was</i>
<i>helping his mother's housekeeper...</i>

254
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:45,278
- <i>but he had the wrong woman.</i>
- I guess it would just be a guy who...

255
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:47,549
you know,
grabs bananas and runs...

256
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:50,956
or, uh, a banana
that grabs things.

257
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,585
I don't know. Why would a banana
grab another banana?

258
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:55,687
Those are the kind of questions
I don't wanna answer.

259
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:03,361
- Hello.
- Oh, Michael, it's so beautiful here.

260
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:06,873
- <i>You have to come down and see this.</i>
- I'm a little busy right now.

261
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,876
I've got someone else
in the car with me...

262
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:13,438
and I'm not going anywhere
until she's taken care of.

263
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,541
Look, I screwed up, okay?

264
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,621
I'm lost. And I hate them.
I hate the wetlands.

265
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:22,953
They're stupid and wet,
and there are bugs everywhere.

266
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,527
And I think I maced
a crane, Michael.

267
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:28,563
Look, you've got Dad's car.
Why don't you come pick me up?

268
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:32,600
Crazy<i>. Loco.</i>

269
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,327
Listen, we gotta make
a little detour, okay?

270
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,431
So I hope no one's
waiting for you.

271
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,306
<i>In fact, the woman</i>
<i>Michael thought was Lupe...</i>

272
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:44,402
<i>did have people waiting for her</i>...

273
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:47,505
<i>and they had</i>
<i>reported her missing.</i>

274
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:52,519
<i>The real Lupe, however,</i>
<i>was leaving Lucille's for the evening.</i>

<i>Buster, l</i>...

276
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,515
Oh.
Hello.

277
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:00,322
It appears my
one-time admirer...

278
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:04,661
is not planning some grand
romantic gesture after all.

279
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:08,259
You know what? It's his loss.

280
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:11,602
It's his loss.
It's his loss!

281
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:15,370
<i>Gob, meanwhile,</i>

- Say, you're not our regular guy.
- No, I'm the substitute.

285
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:30,385
Hey, Gary, get a picture of me
with the new whistling delivery guy.

286
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:33,223
<i>Gob realized he needed a new plan.</i>

287
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,661
So, I need you to give
your father a message for me.

288
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,290
All right. You heard my dad.
I have to do whatever you ask me to.

289
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:41,165
Right. I forgot about that.

290
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,865
All right. Take this lock-pick set,
break into the permit office for me.

291
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:47,306
- No, I think I better check with my dad first.
- Well...

292
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,573
You're gonna break into a permit office?
Sweet. Can I come?

293
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,739
<i>And George Michael</i>
<i>saw a chance to get closer to Maeby.</i>

294
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:56,977
You know, my dad hates to micromanage.
Let's just do this.

295
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,421
<i>And back at the wetlands...</i>

296
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:02,423
<i>Lindsay finally</i>
<i>found her taxi.</i>

297
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:06,621
Oh, good Lord.
You smell worse than before.

298
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:10,358
Oh, my God. It's me!
- <i>And in her haste</i>
<i>to leave the wetlands...</i>

299
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:12,593
<i>she forgot to call Michael.</i>

300
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,273
Hey. Hey! Stay there. What are you doing?
Get in the car. Don't move.

301
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,911
Lindsay! Linds!

302
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:26,004
Come on.
I'm tired of looking.

303
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,447
She's not here.

304
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,884
She probably never was here.
She set me up.

305
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:35,184
This is probably all about the car.
I'm gonna kill her!

306
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,385
Hey! Where are you going?
Hello!

307
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,595
I'm trying to help you.

308
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,033
You're welcome.

309
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,035
<i>Meanwhile, Gob met with his father...</i>

310

<i>to discuss</i>
<i>the permit office break-in.</i>

311
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:54,308
So I say to Michael, "If it's so important to Dad,

312
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,605
I'll look past your selfishness
and do it."

313
00:16:56,712 --> 00:17:00,978
There's a dentist in here who, uh,
took liberties with his patients.

314
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,383
- I'm gonna ask him to look at
whatever is happening with you.
- Thanks, Pop.

315
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:08,480
Hey, my stock is never gonna be higher
with his gang than it is right now.

316
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:12,652
Yeah. So have you, uh, made a decision or...

317
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:14,922
I don't know.
I thought I had it down to two...

318
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,966
but then the Haitians
made this beautiful pitch.

319
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:22,196
So, uh, any trouble
at the, uh, permit office?

320
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,932
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Easy.

321
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,565
- I delegated, just like you taught me.
- Who'd you get?

322
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,576
George Michael.

323
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:31,578
- My grandson?
- Yeah.

324
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:35,577
You got my 14-year-old
grandson to do this.

325
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,777
Under 18 walks out clean.

326
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:43,757
Listen, um, there's a very strict
"no touching" policy here, but...

327
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,488
Oh, what the hell.
It's worth a week in the hotbox.

328
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:50,759
- No touching!
- You stupid ass.

329
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:53,835
<i>And George Michael was successful...</i>

330
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:56,029
- <i>with the lock pick Gob had given him.</i>
- What are you doing?

331
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:58,106
We're supposed to put the form
in the wrong file.

332
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,107
I know. I'm just
leaving my calling card.

333
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,972
I thought we didn't want
anyone to know we were here.

334
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:05,012
It's a little late for that.
Our fingerprints are everywhere.

335
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,014
You said they weren't
gonna check for fingerprints.

336
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:09,016
No. I said don't
wear your mittens.

337
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:11,109
I didn't want you to look stupid
on the security camera.

338
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,950
- There's a security camera?
- <i>Security breach</i>...

339
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:15,956
Someone's coming. What do we do?

340
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:18,288
I don't know.
I always get caught.

341
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:20,760
Save yourself.
I'll take the hit.

342
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:23,798
My record's clean.
I got my bike seat stolen once...

343
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,094
but I don't think it counts
on your record if you're the victim.

344
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:28,226
There is a record of this, but it's not like I'm...

345
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:31,204
Thanks. I'll take the rap next time
we do something like this, okay?

346
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:34,470
Next time.

347
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:37,808
<i>Hold it!</i>

348
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,507
<i>And Lindsay made it</i>
<i>to the Save the Wetlands auction...</i>

349
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,311
- <i>with moments to spare.</i>
- Hey, Mom.

350
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:44,648
Oh, honey.

351
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:48,154
You're not supposed to show up
as the wetlands.

352
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:51,385
<i>While Lucille was waiting</i>
<i>for Buster to show up and bid on her...</i>

353
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,757
<i>Buster was waiting for</i>
<i>the other Lucille to leave...</i>

354
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:56,092
<i>for what he assumed</i>
<i>was</i> The Producers...

355
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:59,065
<i>but was now, in fact,</i>
<i>the bachelorette auction.</i>

356
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,069
<i>And Lindsay was finally</i>
<i>up for auction...</i>

357
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,663
<i>which Michael arrived</i>
<i>just in time to see.</i>

358
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,607
<i>What do I hear</i>
<i>for Lindsay Bluth?</i>

359
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:12,010
<i>Gentlemen, it's a good cause.</i>
- <i>And as Michael</i>
<i>looked at his sister...</i>

360
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:16,517
<i>uncertain whether her face was red</i>
<i>from embarrassment or the sun damage...</i>

361
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,588
<i>it was clear she had been</i>
<i>in the wetlands that day.</i>

362
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,057
One thousand.

363
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,684
Seriously?

364
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:32,358
Sold... to the man
who truly knows what charity is.

365
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:37,405
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the lovely Lucille.
- Move! Move! Move! Move!

366
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:41,272
- <i>Who is the lucky bachelor</i>...
- <i>And Buster showed upjust in time</i>...

367
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,210
Ten thousand dollars!

368
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,941
- Buster!
- <i>to bid on the wrong Lucille.</i>

369
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,483
How grand!

370
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:53,043
How terribly grand!

371
00:19:56,025 --> 00:20:00,553
Well, how embarrassing. My own
brother buying me? I'd rather die.

372
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:05,392
Thank you.
Maybe you're not that selfish.

373
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:08,595
You actually went out there.
I was impressed you gave it a shot.

374
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:10,763
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>Is this your car?</i>

375
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:13,674
Yes. It's his.

376
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:17,007
- You're under arrest...
- Ow! Ow!

377
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:21,105
for the forced abduction
of Helen Maria Delgado.

378
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,456
What'd you do?

379
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:31,685
just trying to be a good guy.

380
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:36,128
Me too. Me too.

381
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:38,392
Let's go see Pop-Pop.

382
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:44,167
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

383
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:48,471
<i>Michael gets a lucky break when Helen</i>
<i>makes the same mistake that he did.</i>

384
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:50,272
- Four<i>. Cuatro.</i>
- Four, step forward.

385
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,942
<i>And Gob kicks himself</i>
<i>for a bad business decision.</i>

386
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:00,180
Look, a seagull!

387
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:04,453
I never should've given up animation rights.

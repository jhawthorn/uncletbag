1
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,215
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:07,692
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,907
<i>Michael Bluth was taking his son...</i>

6
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,534
<i>to an interview at the prestigious</i>
<i>Milford School...</i>

7
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:27,808
<i>an institution</i>
<i>once famous for its credo...</i>

8
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,611
<i>that children should be</i>
<i>"neither seen nor heard."</i>

9
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:32,879
"Woman."

10
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:36,322
They're not getting in.

11
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:39,757
- I might not get in either, and that
wouldn't be the end of the world.
- Shh.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,420
We're not even going down
that road, okay?

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,055
The next four years
are all about your future...

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,327
and that's the most
important thing to me, okay?

15
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:50,734
Things have changed around here.
We have talking sessions throughout the day.

16
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:53,671
<i>We even have a talking room</i>
<i>where students are encouraged...</i>

17
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:56,242
to go in and talk
to their heart's content.

18
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:59,177
- Sounds like fun.
- First thing he's said all day.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,407
The point is I'm not my father.

20
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:04,143
<i>I do think it's best</i>
<i>for the Milford School...</i>

21
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:06,742
<i>to distance itself</i>
<i>from the Bluth name.</i>

22
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:08,754
It's... nothing personal.

23
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:11,324
Are you talking about the fact
that my father is in jail?

24
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:14,087
Because I don't like to be
compared to my father either.

25
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,255
- I don't mind being compared to my father.
- Save it for the talk room.

26
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:21,768
- Sorry.
- I can assure you that my family
is back on track...

27
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,930
- <i>and no longer in any trouble.</i>
- Not according to today's paper.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,008
Oh, God.
What have we done this time?

29
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:36,812
- Don't ever mention Klimpy's to me again.
- What did you do?

30
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:40,683
If I still had money, I'd buy a Klimpy's
just to burn it to the ground.

31
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:43,120
I know, Mom. You hate Klimpy's.
Tell me what happened.

32
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:47,217
Your sister and I tried to get into
that new restaurant, Rud...

33
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,319
and they wouldn't let us in.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,125
Mrs. Bluth, there's absolutely no room.

35
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:54,258
Come on. I've suddenly lost my appetite.

36
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:56,268
Oh, who's going to believe that?

37
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,463
<i>With her blood sugar at a perilous low...</i>

38
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:01,132
<i>Lucille made Lindsay pull into</i>
<i>the nearest restaurant.</i>

39
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:04,211
Welcome to Klimpy's!
Anywhere you like!

40
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:06,211
This does not bode well.

41
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:11,880
- I'll have the Ike and Tina Tuna.
- Plate or platter?

42
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,716
- I don't understand the question,
and I won't respond to it.

43
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:18,485
- And what would you like?
- I'd like my old life back.

44
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:21,584
So there really was no fight?

45
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:24,722
Well, one tiny thing at the end.

46
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:29,394
- How can you treat me this way?
- Oh, please! Everything I've said about you...

47
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:33,234
can be covered with makeup
and a lie about a thyroid problem.

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,040
Good grief almighty!
You think I'm enjoying my slide into poverty?

49
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:42,343
Sorry, Lindsay.
There goes your dessert.

50
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,851
Why don't you eat it, Mother?

51
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:49,514
Why don't you just take this cake
and shove it...

52
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,183
Hey, who called the cops?

53
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:55,524
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

54
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,529
Totally blown out of proportion.

55
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:02,125
<i>Well, listen, I think it cost George Michael</i>
<i>a chance to go to the Milford School.</i>

56
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:06,468
Oh, big deal.
Buster's the only one who ever liked it.

57
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:09,907
<i>Buster so excelled at being</i>
<i>neither seen nor heard...</i>

58
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,104
<i>that he remained at the school</i>
<i>undetected for a full two semesters...</i>

59
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:15,375
<i>after he was supposed to graduate.</i>

60
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,883
Nonetheless, this bad press
is starting to taint my son's future...

61
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:19,885
and we've got to put an end to it.

62
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:23,320
Michael, if this is a lecture on how we're all
supposed to whatever and blah, blah, blah...

63
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:25,984
well, you can save it
'cause we all know it by heart.

64
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:29,620
- Good-bye, Missus.
- Lindsay, you'll be happy to know
that I have a new idea.

65
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,166
I met a publicist today.
I'm gonna hire her.

66
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:36,725
- We need somebody to make us look good.
- I say it's a waste of money.

67
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:40,068
We're plenty sympathetic as we are.

68
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:42,074
- Is this your onion?
- Yes.

69
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:47,305
- What's in the foil?
- Nothing. It's a ball of foil for my son.

70
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:49,746
Have a great day, sweetie.

71
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,614
I don't know how she can't.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,520
So this publicist, Michael, is she cute?

73
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:59,616
I never really noticed.
- <i>In fact, Michael</i>
<i>had noticed her at the gym...</i>

74
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:02,594
<i>but only recently gotten up</i>
<i>the nerve to talk to her...</i>

75
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:05,494
<i>giving him a chance to work</i>
<i>on his flirting skills</i>...

76
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,091
- Race you to the top of the hill.
- <i>which had gotten rusty over the years.</i>

77
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:14,505
- I'll race you to the top of the hill.
- I brought a picnic lunch.

78
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,736
- Hey, that hill was really...
- Jessie Bowers.

79
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:20,143
If you ever have any
public relations needs...

80
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:22,943
My relations are already a little too public.
I'm Michael Bluth.

81
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,280
- From the Bluth Company?
- That's right.

82
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,286
I'm giving you my direct line.

83
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>Okay, sure. She's</i>...
<i>She's cute, I suppose.</i>

84
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,121
I mean, now that you're making me
think about it, uh, she's cute.

85
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:39,393
She's a cutie. She's a little cutie pie.
But I never really noticed.

86
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,968
- Why don't you just ask her out?
- That's not an option.

87
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,469
- 'Cause you're scared?
- <i>No, because of George Michael.</i>

88
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,472
He still hasn't gotten over
losing his mother.

89
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,974
I just want to get him through high school;
then we'll deal with me.

90
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,044
So you didn't get any
while you were in high school...

91
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:54,911
and now you're not gonna get any
while George Michael's in high school.

92
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:56,983
<i>And so the family gathered</i>
<i>at the model home...</i>

93
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,518
<i>eager to hear</i>
<i>their new publicist's plan.</i>

94
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,748
- Get jobs and behave?
- <i>Instead of us getting jobs...</i>

95
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:05,223
why don't you do your job and
tell everyone we've got jobs?

96
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,590
- I have a job.
- Kiss ass.

97
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:10,220
<i>Well, we were all thinking it.</i>

98
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,266
<i>Uh, I'm unclear about</i>
<i>what it is exactly you do.</i>

99
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,664
Excellent question.
A publicist...

100
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,998
No, no. I was talking
to George Michael.

101
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:19,231
When did you get a job?

102
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,865
- At the banana stand.
- Oh! Duh.

103
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:24,240
I thought you meant like
a plumber or something.

104
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:27,542
And I was like, "When did that happen?"

105
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:30,014
<i>Jessie, why don't you just</i>
<i>go ahead andjump in here.</i>

106
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:32,017
It's a tough group
to keep focused.

107
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,748
I'm going on the offensive.
I want to get an article in the paper...

108
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:38,791
to show that this is a functional family
and a relatable family.

109
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:41,691
Are we on? Hello!
Hello from prison!

110
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,730
<i>Thanks toJessie</i>
<i>for setting up this telelink.</i>

111
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,733
I've started a Torah study group.
I'm very excited about it.

112
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:52,738
Looks like... I don't know... looks like
I have some possible converts.

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,875
Your father's religious now?
We'll play that up.

114
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,467
Your father's religious now?
We'll play that up.

115
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:59,375
- It's very sympathetic.
- Yeah. Who doesn't love theJews?

116
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,574
And it allows me to put
Michael front and center.

117
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,583
He needs to be
the new face of this family.

118
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:07,051
He's the only likable one
in the bunch. No offense.

119
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:10,646
- None taken.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

120
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,953
Isn't Michael the least likable one
in the family?

121
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,221
<i>No. There are very few intelligent...</i>

122
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,492
attractive and straight men
in this town.

123
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,534
Well, that certainly leaves me out.

124
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,899
She... She said single.

125
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:28,839
You did say "single," correct?
I thought l...

126
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,843
I didn't quite hear that.
The reception is bad.

127
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,845
But as the Talmud tells us...

128
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,575
...to the jackal as to an oxen.

129
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,950
Did it get a laugh?

130
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,080
Sorry. I'm still on the whole
Michael being likable thing.

131
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,250
<i>You know that he's only had sex</i>
<i>with, like, four women, right?</i>

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,260
<i>Let's focus on</i> your <i>likability.</i>

133
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:50,922
You're going to start doing
some charity work with your magic.

134
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,556
<i>Actually, I'm kind of</i>
<i>the charitable one of the family.</i>

135
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,329
- <i>I think it's best if you got a job.</i>
- <i>Oh, come on!</i>

136
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:59,838
I'm a parent. I care about my daughter every
bit as much as Michael cares about his son.

137
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,408
What grade am I in?

138
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,943
- What kind of job?
- <i>Something where you'll be seen.</i>

139
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:06,945
I represent Cloudmir Vodka...

140
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:10,175
<i>and they want someone to promote it</i>
<i>by ordering it at a hot bar.</i>

141
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:13,481
- A place like Rud.
- Okay. I'll do it.

142
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,714
<i>And, Tobias,</i>
<i>you're a medical doctor...</i>

143
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,348
and you're living an absurd fantasy
as an actor.

144
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,519
- It's time to get real.
- Wow.

145
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:24,119
It's tough talk, but I like it.

146
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,461
You're saying land a major film.

147
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,296
I'm saying get your medical license back.

148
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:31,064
I've set up a hearing
for tomorrow in Boston.

149
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:35,301
- Michael has generously donated $1,100
for your trip.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

150
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,901
I truly believe that the universe wants me
to be an actor and not a doctor.

151
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,982
- I'm just waiting for a sign.
- Here's your cash.

152
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:45,984
- Universal Shuttle picks you up at 8:00.
- Any sign, really.

153
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:49,715
Sorry. Some of my students
are arguing the significance...

154
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:52,121
of the shank bone
on the seder plate.

155
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:57,664
But that... Not... not wag our genitals
at one another to make a point.

156
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:02,327
- Thought provoking.
- And, Lucille, people think you're cold.

157
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:07,068
Hanukkah can be spelled so many ways. Oh, God!

158
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:14,239
- Buster.
- Right here. Ready to go.

159
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:16,339
At your service.
Get me out there.

160
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,350
<i>I want you to stay in.</i>

161
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,920
<i>People find you</i>
<i>odd and alienating.</i>

162
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:23,717
<i>You make them uneasy.</i>
<i>Stay out of the spotlight.</i>

163
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:27,817
I shall be neither seen nor heard.
Watch me.

164
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:31,363
You can always tell a Milford man.

165
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,266
<i>Each with their new charge...</i>

166
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,935
<i>the Bluths set about</i>
<i>redefining their image.</i>

167
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,945
<i>Tobias was off to Los Angeles</i>
<i>International Airport...</i>

168
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:49,572
<i>determined to return</i>
<i>to his family with a career.</i>

169
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:51,583
Well, this is great.

170
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,119
Why would anybody take a limo?

171
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,689
What is this, like, $12?

172
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,988
Why would anybody pay more than $12
to go to the airport?

173
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:03,222
Next stop, LAX.

174
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,390
Come on! We're stopping again?
How many more stops are we gonna make?

175
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,233
Honestly, I haven't even seen
this part of Los Ang... Is that snow?

176
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,238
<i>Really, now. This is ridiculous.</i>

177
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>I paid 12 American</i>...
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

178
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:21,442
You are Carl Weathers, the actor.

179
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:24,574
I went to San Francisco to attend
your stage fighting workshop.

180
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:28,815
- But you never showed up.
- I got bumped from that flight.

181
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,822
Hell, they'll give you $300
if you get bumped.

182
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:35,725
It's this crazy loophole in the system
that the wrong guy discovered.

183
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,731
Guess where I won't be going.

184
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,291
Yeah. So...

185
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,894
I am an actor too.

186
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:48,031
- Oh. Good.
- Well, I want to be.

187
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:52,545
Without the proper training,
I'm afraid I'm doomed to be a doctor.

188
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:55,012
Well, hell, I can train you.

189
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:57,709
Oh, well, I'm afraid
all I have is $1,100...

190
00:09:57,818 --> 00:10:00,218
and that's for this plane ticket, so...

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,417
Check this out. $1,100 is exactly
what I charge for acting classes.

192
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:07,153
- No, it isn't!
- Yeah.

193
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,752
What are the chance...

194
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:12,957
Universe, you've done it again.

195
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:17,196
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was beginning</i>
<i>his charity work at a local nursing home.</i>

196
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:21,604
I'm gonna need a volunteer
for my next illusion, the Aztec Tomb!

197
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,144
- <i>A tomb?</i>
- Or box. Box is... fine.

198
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:28,544
<i>Oh, yes! Well, excellent.</i>
<i>Let's get you in the box.</i>

199
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,549
There's a panel.

200
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:34,087
just flip it around, curl up behind it,
don't make any noise.

201
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:41,985
<i>Ancient lore has it the Aztec gods</i>
<i>put a curse on any man who dare</i>...

202
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:46,532
- What?
- He's gone.

203
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:49,693
<i>Buster was also</i>
<i>doing his share for the family.</i>

204
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:57,333
<i>And Michael, atJessie's insistence,</i>
<i>was out on the town.</i>

205
00:10:57,444 --> 00:11:00,038
I haven't been out to dinner in so long,
I feel a little guilty.

206
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:02,581
You have nothing
to be guilty about.

207
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:05,243
You're the only one in your family
who's ever been responsible.

208
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,752
Well, I'm certainly the only one
that's ever held a real job.

209
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:10,755
<i>Oh, really, Michael? Watch this.</i>

210
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:13,348
Wow! This Cloudmir's
making me think fuzzy.

211
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,054
I have almost no judgment at all.

212
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:19,564
- Two more Cloudmirs, please.
- "Only one with a real job."

213
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,861
jessie, you've really been doing
a great job with my family.

214
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:27,304
- Oh, good. Get one of Michael and me on a date.
- <i>Sure.</i>

215
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:30,308
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

216
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,709
A date? This is a date now?
I thought this was just business.

217
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:36,647
Can't it be a little bit of both?

218
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,718
How will I know
which part of it is business?

219
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,083
Uh-oh.

220
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:46,121
Can't wait to see
which part of it is a date.

221
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,328
Show me business again.

222
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:56,265
<i>What you doing?</i>

223
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,930
just trying to get the TVworking.

224
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,940
Oh, yeah, I tried that earlier.
I think it's still hooked up to the prison.

225
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:05,307
So when those guys kept saying,
"Hey, you, boy," that was me?

226
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,348
- I was the boy?
- Sounds like it.

227
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,610
Have you told your dad
you don't want to go to that school?

228
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:15,245
I'm thinking of just going. I mean,
the graduates go on to do great things.

229
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:20,488
I suppose, but that means we won't
be going to the same high school.

230
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:23,358
Man, it just keeps getting worse.

231
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:26,261
- But he's my Dad.
I don't want to disappoint him.
- Man.

232
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:29,665
You and I are so different.
It's like we're not even related.

233
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,199
That'd be amazing.

234
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,836
Oh, my God.

235
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:42,282
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>
- Hey, Dad.

236
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:45,112
I'm sorry that I'm so late,
but I was with Jessie.

237
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:48,119
This girl's making some serious progress
in getting you into that school.

238
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,883
She just booked Gob a gig
at Earl Milford's nursing home.

239
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,118
- You're gonna be a shoo-in.
- Oh.

240
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,956
She's kinda something, isn't she?

241
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,361
Yeah, I guess.

242
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:02,299
I mean, you know, hey,
she is no replacement for your mom.

243
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,427
- Oh, no. No way.
- Not at all.

244
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:07,803
- She's just working for us.
You're not dating her.
- No, I am not dating her.

245
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,808
Absolutely not dating her.

246
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,811
just you and me.
The Bluth boys.

247
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:15,143
Bluth boys.

248
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:17,478
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

249
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:26,316
- Hey.
- Hey.

250
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,326
- Is he in bed?
- He's on his way.

251
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,529
Hey, listen, listen,
listen, listen.

252
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:36,728
This might be moving
a little bit too fast for him.

253
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:39,067
I mean for... for us.

254
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:41,504
Me. Uh, for me.

255
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:44,008
Maybe we should
take a step back...

256
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,238
and just keep
this relationship professional.

257
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:50,248
- Oh, I think that would take all the fun out of it.
- No. Seriously, seriously.

258
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,511
You're amazing...

259
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:55,349
- but I just think we should slow down.
- Uh-huh.

260
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:59,186
So the two months on the bike,
that was, what, for my health?

261
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,123
We had great conversations.

262
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:04,527
- Seriously, this is hard for me.
- This is hard for me too.

263
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:08,897
I've got a life to get on track,
and I don't like wasting time, so let's do this.

264
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,596
Let's take two steps back...

265
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,037
and why don't you find yourself
a new publicist.

266
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,540
jessie.

267
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:25,243
No. I was just saying your name
as you walked away. I didn't...

268
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,482
I have no follow-up.

269
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,115
Jessie.

270
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:35,126
<i>Michael felt bad</i>...

271
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:38,391
- <i>but he felt even worse</i>
<i>when he got a call from his brother.</i>
- Hello.

272
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:40,557
It's Gob. I'm looking forJessie.

273
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,966
- She just left. What's wrong?
- I need her to spin something for me.

274
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,970
Well, that's too bad
because I think she quit.

275
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:48,632
- What do you need her to spin?
- Murder.

276
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:57,473
<i>Michael was summoned to help his brother.</i>

277
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:00,781
- Murder, huh? Who died?
- My career.

278
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:03,651
- I'm going to go home now.
- I lost a guy.

279
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,222
I put him in the Aztec Tomb,
and he disappeared.

280
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:09,454
- Isn't that the point?
- This will ruin me.

281
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:12,293
- He's probably fine. He just escaped.
- No! I need Jessie!

282
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,197
Well, she quit when I told her
that I couldn't go out with her.

283
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:17,202
You know, I have to do
the right thing for my son.

284
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:21,832
Then you better get her back
because the guy I lost was Earl Milford.

285
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:25,810
- What?
- I didn't know it was him.

286
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:28,073
Although he was
spectacularly quiet in there.

287
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:30,376
You can always tell a Milford man.

288
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:33,317
Gob, have you destroyed my chance
at getting my son in that school?

289
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,650
Not with the right spin.

290
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,926
jessie. Get her back.

291
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,655
<i>Charged with the task</i>
<i>of renewing his medical license...</i>

292
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:47,597
<i>Tobias was enjoying his first acting class</i>
<i>with Carl Weathers.</i>

293
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:50,932
I don't know what your police captain
told you about me...

294
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,904
but I'm a different breed of cop.

295
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:57,499
I'm from the streets,
and I'm the <i>last</i> cop...

296
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:00,546
you're ever gonna wanna
mess with in a darkened alley.

297
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:04,947
Dark alley. And l...

298
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,110
Listen, Mr. Weathers,
I don't know.

299
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,120
Perhaps my wife was right.

300
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:12,658
I don't know if I'm cut out to be a...
a De Niro...

301
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,286
or a Regis or a Pinkett-Smith
or what have you.

302
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,296
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Tobias.

303
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:21,265
Dreams are worth fighting for.

304
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:26,032
<i>Now, are you gonna be a fighter,</i>
<i>or are you gonna be a doctor?</i>

305
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,130
You're right, Carl Weathers.

306
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:31,938
I should just march into that restaurant
where my wife works and tell her...

307
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:34,206
Your wife works in a restaurant?
Do they get a shift meal...

308
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:37,112
or do they just pay half-price
on select menu items?

309
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:41,313
- I don't know.
- Well, let's find out, man.

310
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,389
<i>And the press got hold of Gob's story.</i>

311
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,187
- Where is Earl Milford?
- l... I don't know, all right?

312
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,489
I put him in a box.
I didn't kill him, all right?

313
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:52,156
And don't edit this for your broadcast
so it looks like I'm screaming...

314
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:53,892
"I killed Earl Milford."

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,230
Startling confession,
tonight at 11:00.

316
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:59,396
<i>Minutes later, Gob unloaded his equipment...</i>

317
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,770
<i>and made a surprising discovery.</i>

318
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,142
Don't send me back.
They abuse us. It's not pleasant.

319
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,151
Earl, I have to take you back.

320
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:17,155
- It's the only way to clear my name.
- You'll have a new name:

321
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:21,159
- Hero.
- Hero.

322
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:23,286
That could work for me.

323
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:26,194
<i>Meanwhile, Jessie decided</i>
<i>to pay George Michael a visit.</i>

324
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:28,529
Hi, George Michael.
Proud of yourself?

325
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,967
Yeah. I got a bum away from the stand
without hurting his feelings.

326
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,471
- That was pretty sweet.
- <i>No. I mean about your father.</i>

327
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:35,939
About denying him
his chance to be happy.

328
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,875
You're into that too?
I'm rubbing off on you, huh?

329
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,106
No. I want my dad to be happy.

330
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,375
It's too late now.
I've seen to that.

331
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:46,543
Daddy lost his shot at happy,
and it's all your fault, Opie.

332
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:50,020
<i>Jessie had gone too far,</i>
<i>and she had best watch her mouth.</i>

333
00:17:50,123 --> 00:17:52,887
Michael's about to become
the most unlikable man in town.

334
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:56,019
Check the papers.

335
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:58,723
She kind of reminds me of my mother.

336
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,300
<i>And later that night,</i>
<i>Lindsay was working at Rud.</i>

337
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:05,132
You seem like a man of taste and class.

338
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:07,706
I'll give you $2,000 to touch me.

339
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,310
Oh, my God. My husband.

340
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,675
Oh, my God. My husband.

341
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:14,611
You're married to Carl Weathers?

342
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:17,444
What's going on? Why are you here?
Why aren't you in Boston?

343
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,919
- Who's he?
- His name is Carl Weathers,
and he's my new acting teacher.

344
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:25,822
And, Lindsay, he's teaching me
all these valuable life lessons.

345
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:29,361
- I buy all my cars at police auction.
- He's full of stuff like that.

346
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:33,956
And, Lindsay, he's teaching me
to follow my dreams.

347
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:38,469
Give me a bourbon.

348
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,165
Any room on that tab
for me to jump on?

349
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,174
<i>And Michael caught up with Jessie.</i>

350
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:45,176
Listen, thanks for coming.

351
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:47,269
I was just...
I was doing some thinking.

352
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,507
You know, I pulled away,
and that was wrong.

353
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:53,074
- I really want to make this work.
- Get away from my son!

354
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:55,552
Hey, Mom.
Kind of on a date here.

355
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:58,522
You'll change your mind after this.

356
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:03,892
<i>And Michael saw the story</i>
<i>thatJessie had planted.</i>

357
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,864
<i>Let me tell you something, sweetie.</i>

358
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,025
We may pick on each other,
get into little scrapes...

359
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:11,933
call each other names and
occasionally steal from each other...

360
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:14,097
but that's because we're a family.

361
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:15,936
You have no right.
You don't get to do that.

362
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,875
"Lindsay's a combative,
entitled princess"?

363
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,003
I should hire somebody
to kick your ass for that.

364
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:23,378
- Save your money.
- Yeah, you're right. I'll do it myself.

365
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:27,419
Hey, whoa! We are not settling things
like that anymore, all right?

366
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,422
- I don't need my son reading about us
in the paper.
- Oh, you and your son.

367
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:33,583
Stop using him as an excuse
for everything you do.

368
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:36,491
- I saw him today. He's fine with us.
- What? You saw him today?

369
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:38,826
Yeah. I told him he was getting
in the way of your happiness.

370
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:41,400
You did?
You said that to my son?

371
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,729
Yeah.

372
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,198
You're on your own.
Ladies?

373
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:53,845
<i>Food fight!</i>

374
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,448
<i>What are you doing?</i>

375
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:01,577
<i>Oh, my face!</i>

376
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:05,021
<i>I'm gonna get you guys!</i>
<i>Stop!</i>

377
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,616
<i>The press is having a love affair...</i>

378
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:10,059
with hating the Bluth family...

379
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:13,599
and they were the center
of another brawl this evening.

380
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,295
I'm looking at $50,000 worth
of medical bills here.

381
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:20,429
It looks like you won't be getting into
this school. Are you disappointed?

382
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,872
Well, are you disappointed?

383
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,503
Look, George Michael, I want you
to tell me how you feel, okay?

384
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:28,843
I don't want you to worry so much
about hurting my feelings.

385
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:32,349
I didn't want to go to that school,
and Jessie's a psycho.

386
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:35,453
That could've saved us
a little bit of time.

387
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:38,615
But, Dad, if you ever want to date
anyone else, that's fine with me.

388
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,853
Yeah? Thanks, buddy.

389
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:46,398
- 'Cause you know, I mean,
four women, that is kind of sad.
- All right. Thank you.

390
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:49,161
I know you got married in college,
but that was your sophomore year.

391
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,863
- You had your whole freshman year to...
- That's enough honesty for now.

392
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:55,304
- Thank you. Good night.
- There must have been girls at parties.

393
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:58,634
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

394
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:00,679
<i>Gob holds a press conference</i>
<i>ofhis own.</i>

395
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,340
And, now, prepare
to call me "hero."

396
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:08,921
He's resting, so...
Oh.

397
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:12,014
Pick a card.
Oh, boy.

398
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,593
<i>And Buster moves</i>
<i>to the kitchen.</i>

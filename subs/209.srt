00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,903
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,680
<i>Michael Bluth was working</i>
<i>at home when his son made a curious request.</i>

6
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,692
Dad, would anyone miss this
<i>Peter and the Wolf</i> read-along record?

7
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,854
No. I think that's part of
the model home decorations. Why?

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,128
You're right. My girlfriend Ann wants
to have a Christian music bonfire here.

9
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,864
That sounds like some mild fun.
I think we've got some Christmas music.

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:43,033
Oh, no. It's not- It's not a "Christian music"
bonfire. It's a Christian "music bonfire."

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,202
You know, we burn
all satanic music.

12
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,371
The thing is, though, the only music
I have is either instructional or humor.

13
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,882
<i>He'd been particularly fond</i>
<i>of a CD of something called TheJerky Boys.</i>

14
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,885
Hello.

15
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,956
Hey, nitz. Hey, jerky.
I wanna buy a house, Dad.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,218
- It's gotta be big.
- You said "Dad," buddy.

17
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,453
Shut up, jerky.

18
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,757
Hey, George Michael. Jesus called.
He wants your <i>Thriller</i> album.

19
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,563
<i>Yeah, I don't think the bonfire</i>
<i>is such a great idea.</i>

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,900
I know it might be weird,
but Ann's my girlfriend...

21
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,304
so I think I'll go
buy some albums today.

22
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,899
Hey, can you cover for me
at the banana stand if l-

23
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,173
- No.
- <i>I'll cover for you, pal.</i>

24
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,909
It's been a long time since I've been down
at that banana stand.

25
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,783
Oh, okay. Good. It's the only way
we're ever gonna get it air-conditioned.

26
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:32,085
<i>Michael! How would you like</i>
<i>me to owe you a favor?</i>

27
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,820
I want you to bid on me at
the charity auction this year.

28
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,362
Okay. Now I'd like to use up
my favor and decline.

29
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,523
And isn't that Buster's annual job?

30
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,465
Yes, but I can't have
a replay of last year.

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,027
<i>When Buster</i>
<i>inadvertently bid on Lucille 2.</i>

32
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,040
- $10,000!
- Buster.

33
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,373
And you're embarrassed to have Oscar bid on you.

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,606
With his two pair
of pants? You bet.

35
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,275
Oh, hi, Mom.
I have the afternoon free.

36
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,012
Really? Did <i>nothing</i> cancel?

37
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,555
All right.
I need to borrow a fur.

38
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,615
I thought you were antifur, Lindsay. Weren't
you protesting some hunter gun thing yesterday?

39
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,786
I stopped by.
I hadn't chosen a side.

40
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,126
...which follows all the rules.
- Murderers! You're all murderers!

41
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,998
There are plenty of rules
about guns already on the books.
<i>- Murderers!</i>

42
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,332
You're not allowed
to sell a gun to a kid.

43
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,169
- <i>You're not even allowed</i>
<i>to fire your gun in the air</i>-
- Is that Frank Wrench?

44
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,038
On the Fourth ofJuly.

45
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,978
<i>In fact, it was People's Choice</i>
<i>nominated actor Moses Taylor...</i>

46
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,346
<i>famous for his portrayal</i>
<i>of the rule-abiding detective</i>-

47
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,248
- Stop sign.
- <i>Frank Wrench...</i>

48
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,652
<i>star of the television show Wrench.</i>

49
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,088
<i>Well, that's one rule</i>
<i>I'm not gonna follow.</i>

50
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,758
- Aah.
- That's the Second Amendment. Read it.

51
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,831
What do you need
with one of Mom's furs?

52
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,492
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

53
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,432
- No.
- All right, look.

54
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,870
I met Moses Taylor. We're having
a date in the park tomorrow.

55
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:57,431
Try to get him to bid on you at the auction
tomorrow, because Michael can't.

56
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,444
He's bidding on Mother.

57
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,846
Except that I'm not. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go work in the banana stand.

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,442
And I'm gonna see if I can get
a wrench to strip my nuts.

59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,216
I was trying to be sexy.

60
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,291
It just got away from me.

61
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:17,523
<i>It's bachelorette season in Newport Beach,</i>
<i>and some lovely ladies are up for auction.</i>

62
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,827
<i>Plus, another wolf sighting in the park.</i>
<i>What that means for your weekend</i>-

63
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,834
Bad news, Michael.

64
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,064
I'm afraid the Blue Man Group
and I have parted ways.

65
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:30,233
Seems I'm officially no longer
a standby understudy.

66
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,143
- "Cease and desist."
- Seems they don't appreciate competition.

67
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,715
<i>Tobias had recently taken out an ad...</i>

68
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,284
<i>in a trade magazine</i>
<i>for a one-man show.</i>

69
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,412
<i>And the worst part is Lindsay's out there</i>
<i>chasing some successful actor.</i>

70
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,991
Television's Frank Wrench.

71
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,823
I need to prove to her that I'm
not just a man, but a man's man.

72
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,056
I think she knows that.

73
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,726
Jesus! It's the wolf! That is
the wolf! The wolf is upstairs!

74
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,167
I think it's just my son's
<i>Peter and the Wolf</i> record.

75
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,899
I thought that was a Homefill.

76
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,601
<i>Michael went</i>
<i>to check on his fugitive father...</i>

77
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,178
- <i>who was living in the attic.</i>
- You heard my call?

78
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,942
Have you been doing that all over town?
Because people think there's a wolf on the loose.

79
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,075
Yes, there is a wolf on the
loose. His name is Oscar.

80
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:17,418
Tell me he's not gonna be bidding on your
mother at that charity auction with my money.

81
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,491
Is that why you called me
up here, Dad?

82
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,356
Because you are a fugitive, and as far
as she knows, you're in another country.

83
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,262
It's driving me crazy.
They're parading in public.

84
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:30,166
My back is-is- it's in knots.
I haven't had a massage since prison.

85
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,170
Hope that was forced.

86
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,639
But then I found a way to fix my back
in this old catalog. Look at this hot tub.

87
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,200
I could use it for so many things.
It could be my, you know, water supply.

88
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:44,113
And those, uh, premade boil-in-bag meals-
You just toss those in there.

89
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,276
- You're not getting a hot tub.
- Come on. Please!

90
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,355
Dad, please. We can't afford that.
We're in this mess because of you.

91
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,946
I'm working at the banana stand
just so we don't lose a shift.

92
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,891
- But-
- We're done pampering ourselves in this family.

93
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,627
Yeah, I would like the biggest
air-conditioner you've got.

94
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,859
No, no, not tomorrow.
I need-

95
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,868
I need it today.
I'm not here tomorrow.

96
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,962
<i>Just then, Michael ran into</i>
<i>a woman whom he hadn't seen in years.</i>

97
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,406
- Michael?
- Sally Sitwell.

98
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,536
<i>Michael had always</i>
<i>been in love with Sally Sitwell.</i>

99
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,615
- We could steal a golf cart.
- No, they keep 'em locked up.

100
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,810
- I know, 'cause I have a key.
- I'll go get my sweater.

101
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,819
Oh, so you wanna use the key.

102
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,220
<i>But his father had</i>
<i>a longtime competition with her father.</i>

103
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,317
It looks like my boy is gonna be
sticking it to your daughter, Sitwell.

104
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,420
<i>Stick it to her.</i>
<i>Stick it to her.</i>

105
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,499
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>Michael was awkward around her.</i>

106
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,000
Should we go or... stick around?

107
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,072
No, we're not gonna be sticking anything.
Not-Not gonna stick a thing.

108
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,007
<i>Since then, he'd always been</i>
<i>eager to show her that he'd become a man.</i>

109
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,069
- Are you still working here?
- No, no, no. Filling in for my son.

110
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,945
<i>Michael, and</i>- <i>Wow.</i>

111
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,611
- Sally Stickwell.
- <i>Right.</i>

112
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,281
Because the guys
wanted to stick it to me.

113
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,187
- What? No.
- I never-

114
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,351
- Michael used to say that.
- No, I didn't.

115
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,554
- You said other stuff.
- I absolutely did not say that.

116
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,461
- Man, he loved you.
- So, Gob, tell me-

117
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,534
are you still doing
your little tricks?

118
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,125
Do you consider this
to be a little trick?

119
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,934
Oh. Did you just
squirt me with something?

120
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,703
It's lighter fluid.
Didn't put in a new flint.

121
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,712
<i>But still, where did</i>
<i>the lighter fluid come from?</i>

122
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:26,251
- That's- great.
- Michael, maybe I'll see you over at the club.

123
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,150
<i>We never really took</i>
<i>that cart ride, did we?</i>

124
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,622
And we never will,
'cause I'm not there.

125
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,661
- Nor am I here. I mean, I'm here today.
- I'm gonna go.

126
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,993
- Okay.
- Okay.

127
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,567
Smooth, Michael...

128
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,899
like her father's head,
chest, arms, legs and ass.

129
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,099
- What are you talkin' about?
- He's hairless, Michael. It's a condition.

130
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,336
I hate the guy, but at least he's got-
Satiny and smooth probably.

131
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,345
I'm just different
than you, Gob.

132
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,406
I'm not gonna siphon gas out of some girl's
car like you used to in high school...

133
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,510
just so you can show up
and say, "Car troubles?"

134
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,317
It's called taking advantage.
It's what gets you ahead in life.

135
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,518
Like you did with our biggest
shareholder, Lucille Austero.

136
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,925
That was a one-time thing,
Michael. It's over.

137
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,691
<i>It was far from over.</i>

138
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:18,203
- Shall I put the Posturepedic in the down position?
- Elevate the knees this time.

139
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,432
You just let Sally Sitwell slip away
right when she was ready to go.

140
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,509
- You were scared.
- What are you talking about?

141
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,577
Come on.

142
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,374
You gonna get off and do
your little dance too?

143
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,939
No, l-I hurt my ankle yesterday
shooting hoops or something.

144
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,111
Oh, God. My ankle.

145
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,349
- Don't move. Let me-
- No, no, no. It's bad.

146
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,688
- Mother! Mother!
- <i>Buster, it hurts.</i>

147
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,285
<i>Michael decided</i>
<i>that perhaps he should go after Sally.</i>

148
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,456
Have you seen
my other pair of pants?

149
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,228
Lupe washed them, and they
sprouted. I threw them out.

150
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,803
Well, that puts a lot
of pressure on this pair.

151
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,964
<i>I think this one's good.</i>
<i>Looks like it would've put up a fight.</i>

152
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,271
- I put up one to get it.
- As long as it gets Frank Wrench to bid on me.

153
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,277
- <i>It won't.</i>
- <i>Hey, Mom.</i>

154
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,677
I need to borrow
your country club card.

155
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,809
There's a friend I have that has lunch
there often I'd like to run into.

156
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,716
Sounds like you're asking
for a favor.

157
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,951
- I know what that's gonna cost me.
I'm willing to bid on you.
- I'll give you the money.

158
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,517
Start at five grand. If there are
other bidders, back off gracefully.

159
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,090
Shout out, "I get her 364 days
a year for free!" or something.

160
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,169
You're not gonna hear
that phrase.

161
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,603
<i>Soon, Tobias came across</i>
<i>a flyer that promised to improve...</i>

162
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,404
<i>both his masculine self-image</i>
<i>and his financial standing.</i>

163
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,411
They're literally blue, not sad.

164
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,005
<i>Meanwhile, Michael went to</i>
<i>have his accidental encounter with Sally...</i>

165
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,176
- <i>but had forgotten about the</i>
<i>club's dress code for lunch.</i>
- We have a dress code.

166
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,678
I can't wear this.
I look like I'm 16.

167
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,279
- <i>Michael?</i>
- Oh, no.

168
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,359
- Hello, Michael.
- Stan.

169
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,793
- Hello, Sally.
- Hi. So, are you meeting someone here for lunch?

170
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,025
No. I was going to, then they canceled.
So I'm gonna take off.

171
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,591
- No. Just join us, please.
- <i>Michael knew he couldn't say no...</i>

172
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,366
- <i>but he also knew he couldn't</i>
<i>flirt in front ofher father.</i>
- Let's do it.

173
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,376
<i>And at another table,</i>
<i>Gob was being taken out to lunch.</i>

174
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,378
Read me the appetizers again.

175
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,473
Fried cheese with club sauce.

176
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,385
Popcorn shrimp with club sauce.

177
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,616
Chicken fingers-

178
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,954
Oh, stop it.
You're making me dizzy.

179
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,551
With spicy club sauce.

180
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,961
No! I mean stop it.

181
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,431
- Gob?
- Michael.

182
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,399
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh, no.

183
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,132
- I'm just helping her eat.
- Oh, if you'd prefer privacy-

184
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,176
<i>What? No. Are you kidding? I didn't even</i>
<i>wanna have lunch with her in the first place.</i>

185
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:42,338
I just- or- I ju-

186
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,747
<i>And so lunch continued</i>
<i>with both Bluth boys trying to prove...</i>

187
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,480
<i>they weren't interested in the</i>
<i>women they were interested in.</i>

188
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,423
When I saw those golf carts,
it kind of brought back some memories.

189
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,756
Did you have too much club sauce
on your calamari?

190
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,024
<i>Gob, read me the desserts.</i>

191
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,826
She p-

192
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,299
probably forgot
her old lady glasses.

193
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,370
What is the matter
with you, Goby?

194
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,167
<i>I'm happy to read to the lovely lady.</i>

195
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,334
An assortment
of ice creams and sorbets.

196
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,674
- You all right with him reading to your girl?
- Not my girl.

197
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,838
- Huh?
- Why don't you read to your girl?

198
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,246
Come on. I don't have
a girl. No, thanks.

199
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,819
- Already taken care of. Thank you. Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,821
Apparently there's been some
increased activity on your card.

201
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,118
It's been declined.

202
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,286
<i>In fact, the increased activity</i>
<i>on Michael's card was his father's.</i>

203
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,887
You think a hot tub is the best thing
for someone with your condition?

204
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,299
I can't see, but, uh, I didn't know
there was a doctor installing this.

205
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,963
Somebody order a case
of Bag & Boil frozen dinners?

206
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,269
- I'm happy to get this.
- No, no. No, please, Stan. I'll do it. Um-

207
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,867
Can you put this on my mother's card?

208
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,845
Your mother? No. No, no, no.
She's a pool member only.

209
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,143
<i>You'll excuse me</i>
<i>if my tone is not polite...</i>

210
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,548
but this is more polite
than she has ever talked to me.

211
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,987
<i>Michael had a feeling</i>
<i>why his credit card had been rejected.</i>

212
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,184
What the hell did you do?

213
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,989
I overdid it.

214
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,929
Oh, it's so hot.

215
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:16,436
<i>Michael's father hadjust</i>
<i>installed a hot tub in the attic.</i>

216
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,534
- What happened to you?
- I tried to drink some of the water...

217
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,375
and it was too hot,
and it tasted like soy sauce.

218
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,349
<i>I think the teriyaki chicken burst.</i>

219
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,580
That's why people typically don't cook
in these things or install them in attics.

220
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,989
You gotta get it out of here,
Mikey. My eyes, they're burning.

221
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,220
<i>Wanna thank you for charging it</i>
<i>to my credit card.</i>

222
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,558
You made me look very foolish
in front of Sally Sitwell.

223
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,825
- Did you stick it to her?
- No, I didn't.

224
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,663
You screwed that up, just like
you screwed up this hot tub.

225
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,737
Is that veal Marsala
stuck in the intake?

226
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,602
They all look so good
on the boxes.

227
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,733
You know, it's good
you backed off Sally.

228
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:56,372
<i>I don't need that guy saying his</i>
<i>daughter's sticking it to my loser son.</i>

229
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:01,317
You know something? The reason I never went
after her is because you're always pushing me.

230
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,220
<i>But now that I know that I don't have</i>
<i>your approval, l-I think that, uh...</i>

231
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,122
I think that I'll
finally go for it.

232
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:13,096
<i>This isn't turning into</i>
<i>the party hangout I hoped.</i>

233
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,195
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, I thought I heard something before...</i>

234
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,294
like a wolf drowning
or something.

235
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,771
I think that that was
maybe the house settling.

236
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,342
Speaking of settling, how's Ann?
I mean, have you-

237
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,071
have you settled on an
artist's work to burn?

238
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,238
- I was thinking Eminem for a while.
- Sure.

239
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,839
But everyone is gonna be burning
Eminem. So, you know-

240
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,284
And then I got this Pat Boone
album, but the guy is Christian.

241
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,015
But, you know, I don't know.
Somebody's gotta burn, right?

242
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,355
- Well, I guess.
- Right.

243
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,098
- Hey.
- Oh, boy. I got some looks
on the bus 'cause of this.

244
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,031
What are you doing
with that thing?

245
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,594
I am going to catch that wolf, Michael. I'm
gonna shoot it with this tranquilizer gun...

246
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,800
get the reward, and bid on my
woman at the charity auction.

247
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,072
Isn't there some kind of a waiting period
for a rifle like that?

248
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,147
It turns out there is.

249
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,648
Two weeks?
Isn't there a loophole?

250
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,480
There is a gun show loophole.

251
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,352
What timing, huh? I mean, right
out back they were having one.

252
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,358
Gob, I'm going hunting
for my wife.

253
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,792
<i>How lame was Lucille 2 at lunch, huh?</i>

254
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,864
You've gotten attached, haven't you?

255
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,159
You're not gonna tell
anybody about this, are you?

256
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,167
Come on. I'm not one to judge.

257
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,329
Every time I've gone out with Sally,
I've looked like I'm 12 years old.

258
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,236
But, yes, I probably will
tell people about this.

259
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,835
Maybe we can strike up a deal. You keep
this to yourself, I help you get Sally.

260
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,914
Siphon a little
something from her car...

261
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,506
you show up in the Corvette,
looking like a man.

262
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,517
Car troubles?

263
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,883
Probably shouldn't do the fireball
when you siphon the gas.

264
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,321
I guess this flint's still got
a little life left in it, huh?

265
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,088
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile, was waiting</i>
<i>in the park for her date with Moses Taylor.</i>

266
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,721
<i>Sorry I'm late. Fans.</i>

267
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,029
Sometimes it takes a while to jar their memories.

268
00:13:56,135 --> 00:14:00,936
Nice fur. You know, there are some nuts out
there who'd wanna throw red paint all over you.

269
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,669
Wait a minute. I think
there's one right over there.

270
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,042
- Oh, my God. You're-
- Someone needs to read this.

271
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,116
<i>And that's when Lindsay's heel went out.</i>

272
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,287
- I got him.
- False alarm.

273
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,550
Crap.

274
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,961
- <i>I'm being saved by Frank Wrench.</i>
- No, you're not.

275
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,060
- Frank Wrench.
- Shut up.

276
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,231
<i>But, unbeknownst</i>
<i>to Lindsay and Tobias</i>-
- Oh, shoot.

277
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,640
- Oh, great.
- <i>the actor who played Frank Wrench</i>
<i>wasn't saving her...</i>

278
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,110
<i>but was just trying</i>
<i>to distance himself...</i>

279
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,149
<i>from the outlandish "Moses</i>
<i>Taylor Hunts People"scandal...</i>

280
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,482
<i>that had been started</i>
<i>by a rabid anti-gun fanatic.</i>

281
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,122
<i>And that night,</i>
<i>Michael went to help Sally...</i>

282
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,787
<i>with the car problems</i>
<i>Gob had created.</i>

283
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,866
What the hell?

284
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,129
<i>Only to find out</i>
<i>things had gotten out ofhand for Gob.</i>

285
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,137
<i>Michael did look heroic as</i>
<i>he went to put out the fire.</i>

286
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,436
<i>Unfortunately, Sally arrived</i>
<i>too late to see him that way.</i>

287
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,442
God, what happened?

288
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:16,310
Car trouble.

289
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,988
<i>Gob hadjust blown up a car.</i>

290
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,489
The next thing I know,
I'm running for my life.

291
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,084
And all I could think was, if something
were to ever happen to me...

292
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,095
how sad I'd be, you know?

293
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,963
What you did to me at lunch today-
You were ashamed to be with me.

294
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:40,937
No! I was ashamed to be <i>seen</i>
with you. I like being with you.

295
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,771
I'm sorry,
but you have no courage.

296
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,175
How can you say that? Shh.

297
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,613
I thought I heard my mom.
How can you say that?

298
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,185
- <i>And on the other side of the wall</i>-
- Michael?

299
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,413
<i>Lucille was finalizing</i>
<i>her plans for the evening.</i>

300
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,422
You can bid up to 10,000.

301
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,220
The deal is off. You didn't
tell me it was a restricted membership.

302
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,124
Find somebody else
to do your bidding.

303
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,025
There is no one else.

304
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,394
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,161
- They said I could see you finally.
- Yes.

306
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,796
God, I just feel awful
for whoever's car that was.

307
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,205
Mm-hmm. I know it.

308
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,370
Sally, I was thinking that maybe you
and I could-

309
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,576
Don't try to talk. I have to run anyway.
I gotta do this charity auction thing.

310
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:30,212
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Your Blue Cross Blue Shield</i>
<i>was denied. We've called your mother.</i>

311
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,988
I'll be back. I'll check
on you later. Feel better.

312
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,793
Go out sometime.

313
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,367
<i>Michael decided</i>
<i>to bid on her at the auction...</i>

314
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,438
<i>and he knewjust where he</i>
<i>could get the money to do so.</i>

315
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,701
Yeah. Start draining
the hot tub. It's going back.

316
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,436
<i>And Lucille, with no other prospects...</i>

317
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,342
<i>turned to the son she least</i>
<i>expected to support her.</i>

318
00:16:55,447 --> 00:17:00,282
Gob, I don't suppose I could pay you
to bid on me at a charity auction.

319
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,219
<i>And Gob was just</i>
<i>depressed enough to do so.</i>

320
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,449
- Whatever you want.
- Oh, goody.

321
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,025
<i>And finally, George Michael and Ann's...</i>

322
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,755
<i>Christian music bonfire was under way.</i>

323
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,856
- Without ever going to the gym.
- I can't believe how many
people you told about this.

324
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,232
Yeah, I hope I didn't confuse people
by saying it was a CD burning party.

325
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,305
Great party!

326
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,398
Maeby, I burned like 10 CD's
from somebody's MP3 player.

327
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,409
This is a disaster.

328
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,979
<i>Maybe you shouldjust try</i>
<i>listening to some of the music.</i>

329
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,207
Yeah, some of the artists
are kind of talented.

330
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,978
I don't know if you've heard ofThe
Jerky Boys. They do prank phone calls.

331
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,715
It's kind of old school, but-
I have the tape in my room.

332
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,314
I accidentally didn't burn it yet.

333
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,295
- <i>Meanwhile, the auction began.</i>
- Next up...

334
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,194
<i>we've got last year's</i>
<i>charity case, Lindsay Fünke.</i>

335
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,767
- <i>Lindsay showed up-</i>
- Oh, no. Not again.

336
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,837
<i>although she was still</i>
<i>feeling the effects of the tranquilizer.</i>

337
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,339
- Hundred dollars, folks?
- Stick a wrench in me. I'm done.

338
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,273
- <i>Anybody got 50?</i>
- My wife is humiliated.

339
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,904
This is my chance to right
the small wrong that I did.

340
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,609
You shot her in the ass with about
four ounces of horse tranquilizer.

341
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,515
I haven't been the perfect husband.
Yes, I admit that.
- <i>Twenty?</i>

342
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,088
But now is my chance to be a hero.

343
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,023
- Please, Michael, give me some of your money.
- <i>Ten?</i>

344
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,095
- <i>Does anybody have 10?</i>
- I've got $5,000, and I need that for Sally...

345
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,427
- but if you wanna make a low bid-
- Five thousand dollars.

346
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,501
For that? Sold.

347
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,763
I think you overpaid.

348
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,169
<i>George Michael's</i>
<i>prospects were also improving...</i>

349
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,037
- <i>as the two made prank phone calls together.</i>
- Let me try.

350
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,170
- Hey, rubberneck.
- Ann...

351
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,544
could you and George Michael please
call someone else for a little while?

352
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,617
- He knows it was us.
- What?

353
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,617
<i>We finally got a good</i>
<i>one comin'up.</i>

354
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,288
Sally Sitwell. What do I hear?

355
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,161
- <i>Five hundred dollars.</i>
- You're not bidding? I was hoping you would.

356
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,132
<i>- Six hundred!</i>
- You were?

357
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,931
You're a good kid.
You always have been.

358
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,665
Not like that showboat of a father
of yours, if you don't mind me saying.

359
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,503
<i>- Seven hundred!
- I've called him so much worse.

360
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,204
The truth is, sir,
I am interested...

361
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,803
but I don't have the money
to buy your daughter.

362
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,544
- You sure do drive a nice car.
- <i>Eight hundred.</i>

363
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,246
And I need one.
Mine got torched today.

364
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,415
<i>One thousand!</i>
Drop it off when you drop
my daughter off tonight.

365
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,325
<i>And finally, with</i>
<i>both the approval of Sally's father...</i>

366
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:28,388
<i>and the lack of approval ofhis own,</i>
<i>Michael was ready to make his move.</i>

367
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,731
- <i>15,000.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

368
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,828
- Wow.
- Yeah.

369
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,169
I gotta tell ya.
This puts a lot of pressure on me.

370
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,438
- It's for a good cause.
- I heard it was to reseed the greens.

371
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,844
Gonna be a lot of shifts for you
at the banana stand, huh?

372
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,746
I should be honest with you.
I don't have that much money...

373
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,252
- and I sold the Corvette to cover it.
- That's quick. To who?

374
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,948
- Your father, as a matter of fact.
- My father?

375
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,719
- Yeah.
- My father can't drive a convertible.

376
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,851
Mind if I open it up?

377
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,855
Wow!

378
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,867
- Got some pickup.
- <i>This is just like him.</i>

379
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,130
He always interferes
with everyone I date.

380
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,435
Well, you can tell him
to give you your car back.

381
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,443
- But I bought you.
- I'm sorry. I'm not like you.

382
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:18,209
I'd almost rather date someone
my father doesn't approve of.

383
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,115
Thanks anyway.

384
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,390
That-That-That is like me.
That's exactly like me!

385
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,519
<i>And soon it was time</i>
<i>for Gob to bid on his mother.</i>

386
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,589
Not all bad. The only one bidding
on Lucille 2 is that hairless Sitwell.

387
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,464
<i>Seven right there. Eight.</i>

388
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,400
- <i>Sitwell's bidding on Lucille 2?</i>
- Nine.

389
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,031
First he fires me,
then he steals my-

390
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,974
- <i>Going once</i>-
- mother's best friend.

391
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,308
Going twice.
Nine going twice.

392
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,610
- $10,000.
- Oh, how grand.

393
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,915
<i>Sold. Up from $800</i>
<i>to $ 10,000.</i>

394
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,013
<i>Wow. You guys really</i>
<i>want a new golf course.</i>

395
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,423
And all from nonmembers.

396
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,257
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

397
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,595
<i>George Sr. Shows up to bid on Lucille.</i>

398
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,668
<i>But the sound ofhis wolf call...</i>

399
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,465
<i>and the smell of chicken</i>
<i>teriyaki interfere.</i>

400
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,472
No, no, no, no.

401
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,338
<i>No. Oh.</i>
<i>Oh. Oh, no.</i>

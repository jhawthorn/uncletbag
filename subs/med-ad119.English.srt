1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:19,373
<i>Michael was meeting...</i>

6
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,170
<i>Michael was meeting...</i>

7
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:23,334
<i>with the company's accountant,</i>
<i>Ira Gilligan.</i>

8
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:25,469
Anyway, I have gone over this
10 different ways...

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,243
and you're reporting income on an account
that... You know, it is just freezing in here.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,284
Well, the thermostat
is in my office.

11
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:34,286
While it's freezing in here, it's still
hot in there. So please continue.

12
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:37,789
There's basically no money where it
should be. I think I'm catching a cold.

13
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:40,622
- You're not catching a cold.
- I know my body.

14
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,330
- There's no money in the account?
- I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:47,424
- This is like the bayou in here.
- I tried to tell you that.

16
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:50,333
I guess I just had
to find out for myself.

17
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:54,135
Anyway, this isn't the first
discrepancy with your father's books.

18
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,539
With this court case coming up,
I just have to warn you...

19
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:58,737
if they ask me to testify,
I am not gonna lie.

20
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:00,746
- No one's asking you to lie.
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

21
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,816
You're asking Gilligan
not to lie?

22
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:05,511
Please call me Ira.
I don't like Gilligan.

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,588
Who doesn't like Gilligan?

24
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:10,418
Is it cold in here?

25
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:13,015
So, listen. You have been married two
weeks now. It seems to be sticking.

26
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,924
And let's pretend
it's a good thing.

27
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:17,088
I guess this makes me
your best man...

28
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:20,929
and I would like to throw you
a bachelor party.

29
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,333
Yeah, I don't think
she'd go for that.

30
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:26,702
Besides, I talked to Dad. He said it was
stupid to get married in the first place.

31
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:30,106
And he's right. He's right.
I've gotta get rid of her.

32
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,669
You know, l... I said two weeks ago that
I thought it was a stupid idea.

33
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:35,476
Suddenly Dad says it
and it's good advice?

34
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,642
You know you don't have to do
everything Dad says.

35
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:40,220
I don't do everything Dad says. He just
happens to be right about this.

36
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,881
<i>You can help me</i>
<i>get rid ofher though.</i>

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,481
Mom's having a cocktail party. She'll be
there. Maybe you can try to break us up.

38
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:47,959
- I can't do that.
- Why not? You did it with me and Marta.

39
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,792
<i>You had no problem with that, guy.</i>
<i>You know what? Lie to her.</i>

40
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:53,628
Tell her that I'm
insensitive and unreliable.

41
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:57,465
Something about how
you can never confront people.
You need someone to clean up your messes.

42
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,903
See, that's great. And that's just
off the top of your head.

43
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,237
<i>Michael, Gob. I was just</i>
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

44
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:05,039
Good Lord.
It is sweltering in here.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,674
As you may
or may not know...

46
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:11,251
Lindsay and I have hit
a bit of a rough patch.

47
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,150
- Really? When did that start?
- <i>Well...</i>

48
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:17,190
I don't want
to blame it all on 9/11...

49
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,986
<i>but it certainly</i>
<i>didn't help.</i>

50
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:21,288
But anyway, I need your help.
If you could possibly...

51
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,329
Could we go back
to your office, please?

52
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,264
I just want to be
a family again.

53
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:30,428
I guess what I'm saying is
I want to reunite the band.

54
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,166
- Oh, no.
- <i>"Oh, no"was right.</i>

55
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:37,176
<i>In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk</i>
<i>music group with Lindsay and Maeby...</i>

56
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:41,908
<i>called Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural</i>
<i>Good-Time Family-Band Solution.</i>

57
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:45,611
<i>The group was underwritten by</i>
<i>the Natural Life Food Company...</i>

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,554
<i>a division of Chem Grow, an Allyn-Crane</i>
<i>acquisition, and part of the Squimm Group.</i>

59
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:53,115
<i>Their motto was simple.</i>
<i>"We keep you alive."</i>

60
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,931
Zanotab may cause
dry mouth, hair loss...

61
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:02,628
an overly alert feeling, and in some
cases may diminish your sex drive.

62
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,105
Well, there's a wellness
convention in town...

63
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,199
and I thought maybe you could talk
Lindsay into joining me up onstage.

64
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,713
- Yeah. Why don't <i>you</i> ask her?
- Oh, I would, but she just
doesn't take me seriously.

65
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:18,713
<i>Michael tried to find the</i>
<i>money the accountant said was missing.</i>

66
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,014
I don't know.
I probably stole it.

67
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,386
I mean, if he says
it's missing, it is.

68
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:26,085
Unless he stole it.
Hey, maybe he stole it.

69
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:29,458
- He's the one that said it's missing.
- Yeah, I probably stole it.

70
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,259
Well, we need to find it
before Ira is asked to testify.

71
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,300
- I thought we were talking
about Gilligan. Who's Ira?
- Ira Gilligan.

72
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:36,733
Ira's his first name.
He actually hates to be called Gilligan.

73
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:39,067
Well,
he never told me that.

74
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:42,574
Gilligan has promised me that all
this money will be saved in I.R.A.s.

75
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,668
- It's Ira, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Gilligan.

76
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,681
Will be saved in "Iras."

77
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,013
- What the hell is this, Gilligan?
- It's Ira, sir.

78
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,279
- Please call me...
- Gilligan!

79
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,514
Michael, if he testifies,
I am screwed.

80
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:59,491
Here's what you do. You take him
out for some fishing or something.

81
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,925
- Why would I take him fishing?
- Fun. Guy fun.

82
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:04,759
- Let's get him on our side.
- No. Look. I'm not taking him fishing.

83
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:06,162
Oh, that's right.
You hated fishing.

84
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,758
- No, I didn't.
- No, I'll get Gob. Yeah. He liked it.

85
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:10,996
- Hang on a second.
- He's the one who's fun.

86
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:13,869
I liked fishing.
Where are you going? I'm fun.

87
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:15,942
It's just that...
Listen.

88
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:19,012
The way to fix this Ira thing
is not to buy him off. All right?

89
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:22,571
- It's to find out where the money went.
- You're no fun.

90
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:24,844
Yeah.
I'm plenty fun.

91
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,448
<i>That night</i>
<i>the family gathered at Lucille's...</i>

92
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:31,616
<i>to welcome Gob's wife.</i>

93
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:34,990
I have always wanted a daughter.

94
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:37,120
And a blonde.
What fun.

95
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:40,325
- <i>Where did Annyong get thatjuice box?</i>
- <i>Annyong.</i>

96
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,892
Those are for his soccer team. No sugar
for you. You just get more awful.

97
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,134
Hey, Adopted Brother.

98
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,302
Do you think I could have a hit
of that juice box? That...

99
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,346
<i>Michael tried</i>
<i>to convince Lindsay to rejoin...</i>

100
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:06,654
<i>Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural</i>
<i>Good-Time Family-Band Solution.</i>

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,094
Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time
Family-Band Solution was a nightmare for me.

102
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:15,066
Hmm. Well, he said it was
the most fun your family's ever had.

103
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,070
Yeah, well, I was wacked
on Zanotab the entire time.

104
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,402
I thought Zanotab was supposed
to make everything a little bit better.

105
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:24,466
For 15 minutes. Then it burns when
you pee, and your marriage goes to hell.

106
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:28,105
It is not a good supplement. Besides,
Maeby's not gonna want to do it.

107
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,706
<i>I wanna do it!</i>
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

108
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,911
Those were
our best times <i>ever.</i>

109
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,387
This party just keeps
gettin' better.

110
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,085
So, uh... You know, if you want me
on wood block, I can keep perfect time.

111
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,458
Some call me
the human metronome.

112
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:45,225
You notice how I'm always on time?
I'm never late for things.

113
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:47,926
Yeah, but I think punctuality
is slightly different from rhythm.

114
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:51,869
No, it's not. It's the exact same thing.
It's knowing how long things take.

115
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:56,432
Look. I'm just doing this because if my
parents split up, it's a lot more work for me.

116
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:59,273
I know.
They split up once in Boston.

117
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,042
<i>When they get along,</i>
<i>I get tons more alone time.</i>

118
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,447
<i>When they don't, guess who</i>
<i>they start spending all their time with.</i>

119
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:08,043
- Me.
- We've been talking here
for 28 seconds. Just so you know.

120
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,116
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>Dr. "Funky?"</i>

121
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:17,926
- Ah, Fünke.
- Of Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural
Good-Time Family-Band Solution?

122
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:20,796
- Yes!
- Oh, my... I saw you in '96.

123
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,337
- Oh!
- You sang a song about
a supplement called Teamocil?

124
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:26,668
- Teamocil.
- I mean, you just nailed me!

125
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:30,005
It was like you knew every side effect
I was going through at that time.

126
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:38,411
- Sadly, Teamocil has been discontinued.
- Oh.

127
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,044
The sense of wellness
it created in relationships...

128
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:44,591
was merely the first sign of
complete pituitary shutdown.

129
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:46,592
- Excuse me? Are you, uh... Hi. I'm Michael.
- Hi.

130
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:49,629
- I'm Gob's brother.
- Yes. He told me all about you.

131
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,824
- You have a terrific voice.
- I smell olives!

132
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,924
<i>And Michael, as per Gob's request...</i>

133
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,970
<i>tried to convince his wife</i>
<i>that Gob was unreliable.</i>

134
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,336
So, Gob is late. But I guess
that's who you married.

135
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:03,274
He's probably out trying to do
something very important.

136
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:07,939
Are you hitting on me?
Gob said that would happen.

137
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:15,183
Hey, Gob. It's a good thing
you're not staying married to this girl.

138
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,555
You've got her hating me... at least your
version of me, which is actually you.

139
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,064
Well, I talked to Dad,
and he thinks that I should stay in it.

140
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:28,965
Stay in the marriage? You're not letting Dad
lead you around by the nose again, are you?

141
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,199
Think about it. I've got the marriage
and none of the good parts.

142
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:36,208
It's like, so far it's been
all chain and no ball.

143
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,801
- Sure.
- So, we'll have a ceremony and a bachelor party.

144
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:41,847
A bachelor party?
You want one now? Come on.

145
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,077
- You're not giving your best man
a whole lot of prep time.
- Dad can handle it.

146
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:49,747
- Dad?
- Yeah. You know.

147
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:51,848
He's a fun guy, and...

148
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,360
- I'm making him my best man.
- You're making Dad your best man. That's great.

149
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,362
I guess
being your brother...

150
00:07:57,464 --> 00:08:00,058
and solving all your problems for you
doesn't qualify me as your best man.

151
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:04,228
Hey. If he wants to support me,
I'm not gonna tell him to go to hell.

152
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,501
- Don't worry. You're still...
- What? Invited?

153
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:11,009
No, I was gonna say you're still the guy
I want solving my problems, but, yeah...

154
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:13,909
Let me talk to Dad
about that invite situation.

155
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:23,918
<i>The next day, Gob visited his father...</i>

156
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,924
<i>to prepare</i>
<i>for his bachelor party.</i>

157
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:28,051
You know, I really think
that you're gonna like this woman.

158
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:31,529
Well, she's costing me enough, but she's...
oh, she's a hell of a stripper.

159
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,361
- No, I mean my wife.
- Oh.

160
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,958
Well, l... I doubt that
very much.

161
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,871
Well, I can tell you that Michael was
pretty upset that you wanted to be best man.

162
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:45,104
- Don't worry about Michael.
- Yeah, my bachelor party's about having fun, right?

163
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:48,909
No, no. Your bachelor party's about convincing
Gilligan that he's killed a stripper...

164
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,007
getting him out of town
so he can't testify...

165
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:53,416
and making sure that people think
that <i>he</i> took the money.

166
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,385
- It is?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:59,255
This accountant can do us a lot of damage.
I want him neutralized. Do you hear me?

168
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:03,921
That's why I want you to use this stripper...
a narcoleptic, believe it or not.

169
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:07,933
A friend of mine at the yacht club,
he used her for his bachelor party.

170
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:11,402
We wanted you
to have the first piece!

171
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:18,167
You put her in a darkened space,
she's out.

172
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:20,109
You get him drunk.
He passes out.

173
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:24,480
Then you cover the floor with corn syrup,
mixed with a little red dye.

174
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:28,146
He comes to. "Eee! Blood! Aaah!"
He freaks out.

175
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:30,155
Okay. But how do you know
that he's gonna leave the country?

176
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:33,590
That's why I got you those honeymoon
tickets. You never thanked me for those.

177
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,628
I'm sorry. I meant to. I was gonna...

178
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,425
You just have to convince him
that this happened.

179
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,365
- That he killed a stripper?
- Can you do this?

180
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:43,629
Can I trust you? You're not
gonna go all Michael on me, are ya?

181
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,637
Nobody's turning
all Michael on you.

182
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,708
But when you get out, then we're gonna
have a real party. Right, Dad?

183
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,709
Are you kidding?
When I get out of here...

184
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,211
you're gonna throw me the biggest
party this town's ever seen.

185
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:55,611
All right?

186
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,684
<i>Back at the model home</i>...

187
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:02,854
Stop!
It is not Zanotab.

188
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,789
Well, maybe if I was allowed to have
a Zanotab, I'd remember it's Euphorazine.

189
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:09,385
No. We are not going to do that again.
This family is not about to start using.

190
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:11,794
We are pushers,
not takers.

191
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,995
Okay. Once more, from the bridge.

192
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,540
What is that noise?

193
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:24,236
We don't need
the wood block.

194
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:27,074
No, I just thought
I would join in on the fun.

195
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:30,378
I mean, you guys are always talking about,
you know, family and loving and...

196
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,076
having good times
in the circle...

197
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,086
You know what?
This isn't working.

198
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,713
Maybe I'm just gonna go off
and rehearse with Maeby alone.

199
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,848
Oh, fine. Then I'll rehearse
with Maeby after dinner.

200
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,591
No! This is wholesome,
family fun, okay?

201
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:46,427
Let's take it from loose stool!
One, two and a...

202
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,433
What is that in your mouth?
Is that a Euphorazine?

203
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,435
Lindsay, spit it out!
That's not real happiness!

204
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:53,097
- Well, it's better than what we've got now.
- Lindsay, spit it out!

205
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,038
<i>And Michael arrived home...</i>

206
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:57,940
<i>determined to prove</i>
<i>that he was, in fact, fun.</i>

207
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:00,070
I just booked us
a little fishing trip.

208
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,638
- But why? What did I do?
- Hmm? No, no. This is a fun thing!

209
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,775
Okay? Something I've always
wanted to do with you.

210
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:08,184
Everybody's always having fun
around here. Why can't we?

211
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:12,782
<i>Already down! Get</i>
<i>your finger out of my throat! It's down!</i>

212
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:16,385
- Anyway, I thought you hated fishing.
- No, it's fun. I like fun.

213
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:21,058
I just hated doing it with my dad.
This is gonna be you and me. Okay?

214
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:25,264
We get to stay at a hotel, get up at
4:00 a.m., slap on the old seasick patch.

215
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:29,035
We're gonna get out there on the choppy ocean.
We're gonna catch ourselves a little lunch.

216
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,542
Oh, we get to eat it?

217
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,136
After we gut it.

218
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,943
Yes.

219
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,643
<i>While the Bluth boys</i>
<i>contemplated having fun...</i>

220
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:41,915
<i>Lucille had a request</i>
<i>for Gob's bachelor party.</i>

221
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:44,820
- Why do I have to bring him?
- Because Buster's your brother...

222
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:49,157
and I'm not gonna leave him home alone
with all this J-U-l-C-E around.

223
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:52,130
I can spell, Mom.
You spelled "juice."

224
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,792
Oh, you're so brilliant.
Let's see you find it.

225
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:58,462
Besides, I'm going to Annyong's
soccer award ceremony...

226
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,773
<i>Annyong.</i>

227
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:07,614
And I don't need the other soccer moms
knowing how old my first batch of kids are.

228
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:11,072
And I don't need the other soccer moms
knowing how old my first batch of kids are.

229
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:13,675
- Yeah, I think they're gonna know
that Annyong's...
- <i>Annyong.</i>

230
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:16,915
Would somebody please tell
this insufferable child to...

231
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:18,753
God!

232
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:20,759
<i>And so, as Michael and his son...</i>

233
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,920
<i>checked into the hotel,</i>
<i>his brothers arrived.</i>

234
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,591
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, we're having Gob's bachelor party.

235
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,033
You're not going? Even Dad's coming...
Via satellite.

236
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:33,766
Uh, no. I'm gonna go fishing with my son
here. We're gonna go have some fun.

237
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:38,971
Real fun. Okay? Not everything is
strippers and booze and buckets of blood.

238
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,775
<i>Why do you guys</i>
<i>have buckets ofblood?</i>

239
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,941
It's not real blood.
It's corn syrup and red dye.

240
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,713
- Juice.
- We have unlimited juice?

241
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,018
This party is gonna be off the hook.

242
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,493
<i>Meanwhile, at the wellness</i>
<i>convention in the very same hotel...</i>

243
00:12:56,596 --> 00:13:00,532
<i>Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time</i>
<i>Family-Band Solution...</i>

244
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:02,602
<i>was preparing for their show.</i>

245
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,228
Here are the new
Euphorazine side effects.

246
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,503
<i>Ah, the solo. That is for my lovely</i>
<i>and talented daughter.</i>

247
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,907
"Delayed irritability?"
What do they mean by delayed?

248
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:15,209
It means it comes later! This is ridiculous!
Why do we even have to do this?

249
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:18,512
We are doing this
to keep our family together.

250
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:21,746
No, I'm serious.
We're dressed like we're in the '60s.

251
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:25,018
- It's the 21 st century.
We should be dressing like it's the '80s.
- Lindsay...

252
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,151
I'm tired of trying to find happiness
through lies and self-medicating.

253
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:31,253
If you need me,
I'll be at the bar.

254
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,265
Well, fine, Lindsay.
That's fine.

255
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,598
- Maeby and I'll just do...
- Yeah. I'm out too.

256
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:43,932
You think you can handle it alone? 'Cause
if you don't perform, we don't validate.

257
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:51,207
<i>Back in Michael's hotel room...</i>

258
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:53,513
<i>the guys were settling down</i>
<i>for the night...</i>

259
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,350
<i>so as to be ready</i>
<i>for their 4:00 a.m. wake-up call.</i>

260
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,220
It sure sounds like they're
having fun out there by the pool.

261
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:02,853
Oh, they think they're having fun,
Son, but it's not lasting fun.

262
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:06,524
It is fleeting fun,
like a bachelor party.

263
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:13,231
What we got here is lasting fun.
Okay? You think about that.

264
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,639
- Good night, Son.
- Good night, Dad.

265
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:19,507
- <i>Marco!</i>
- <i>Polo!</i>

266
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,513
<i>Marco!</i>

267
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,379
- <i>Polo!</i>
- <i>Marco!</i>

268
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:28,284
- Hey, Dad?
- <i>Polo!</i>

269
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:31,846
- Dad, are you still awake?
- Still awake.

270
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,188
It's just, um...

271
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:36,592
I mean, this is really fun
and everything...

272
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:39,665
This isn't even the fun part.
Tomorrow...

273
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,791
Yeah.

274
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:44,393
The problem I'm having
is, uh...

275
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:48,668
- I have a pretty finely tuned internal clock...
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:51,141
which is why I'm actually
such a good natural percussionist.

277
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:53,804
<i>And, um</i>...

278
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,075
I'm just worried that I'm not
gonna be able to fall asleep...

279
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:58,674
for another two hours
and 45 minutes.

280
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:02,118
So, I was thinking maybe I would
go down and check out Maeby's band...

281
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:04,690
and you could go see if Gob's
bachelor party has started.

282
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:08,022
Shh, shh, shh.
I'm right where I want to be.

283
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:10,187
<i>Gob had his chance</i>
<i>to have me there...</i>

284
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,764
but if you're sure
that you can't sleep.

285
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:15,266
It's just... I don't know when I'm gonna
get another chance like this...

286
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:17,268
- you know, to be there for family.
- Right.

287
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,067
- I'd hate to miss it, because I was too proud.
- Right.

288
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:29,211
Wait a minute. "Too proud?" What does
this have to do with "too proud?"

289
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,614
Actually, that part
was kinda just for you.

290
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:36,951
I was just worried the whole thing wasn't gonna
land unless I included the pride part.

291
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,457
<i>Upstairs, Gob was</i>
<i>preparing to set up the accountant...</i>

292
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,460
<i>under his father's</i>
<i>helpful gaze.</i>

293
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:44,962
- Who called the cops?
- <i>And with the aid of some helpful gays.</i>

294
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,965
You told me to hire people
to look like my friends.

295
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,194
<i>They're Hot Cops.</i>
<i>They're entertainers.</i>

296
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:52,829
Although I specifically asked them
not to come dressed as <i>cops.</i>

297
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:56,636
You better change now. He's gonna be
here soon. Butch, guys. I want it butch.

298
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,643
Hey, uh,
you got the blood. Right?

299
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:01,680
Yeah, I got two buckets full right... Hey!
What the hell happened to the blood?

300
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,809
- Hey, Brother.
- <i>Whoa!</i>

301
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,151
- Somebody put on his lipstick in the car.
- <i>I love</i> juice!

302
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:14,819
This next number is the only ballad
that the Solution ever attempted.

303
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,260
And I must say
I feel a bit like a Mary...

304
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:21,164
without a Peter and a Paul,
but I suppose it's worth a shot.

305
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,393
"Teamocil is
no longer available.

308
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,707
You're out of the band.

309
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,838
<i>And, back at the bachelor party...</i>

310
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,248
<i>Gilligan had arrived,</i>
<i>and the con was in full swing.</i>

311
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:13,649
It's Ira,
and I'm fine.

312
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,778
Come on! Have a drink!

313
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:18,653
There's some stuff coming up you
might not be able to handle sober.

314
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:22,159
Speaking of which,
where's Buster?

315
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,162
<i>In fact, Buster had finished thejuice...</i>

316
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:26,425
<i>and was desperately looking</i>
<i>for his next sugar fix</i>...

317
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,467
<i>when he discovered the cake</i>
<i>in the next room.</i>

318
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:33,028
<i>Unfortunately, he was unaware of the</i>
<i>narcoleptic stripper confined within it.</i>

319
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:39,104
Yeah, I better go in the
back room and have a look for him.

320
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:43,012
- Ira, have a drink!
- <i>I'm not thirsty. I want some food.</i>

321
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:45,277
<i>Ooh.</i>

322
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:47,285
Okay. Keep it together.
Don't go all Michael here.

323
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:50,083
Knock, knock!
Where's the married bachelor?

324
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,590
Michael, I thought you weren't coming.
I thought he wasn't coming!

325
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:56,287
Well, I wasn't going to, but he's my
brother, and I'm here to support him...

326
00:17:56,396 --> 00:18:01,595
like all these, uh,
hot men and Ira.

327
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:04,761
Well, you're not gonna stay.
I mean, this isn't your kind of scene.

328
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:08,329
Dad, please, stay out of it, all right? I'm
here for Gob. Now, where are the strippers?

329
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:08,608
- Well, l...
- Mmm! You got a little back room going, huh?

330
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:10,872
- Well, l...
- Mmm! You got a little back room going, huh?

331
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:12,877
- Huh? Huh?
- Well...

332
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:16,506
just relax. I'm as fun as anybody.
I can handle a back room.

333
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:20,881
- I'm calling the cops.
- No!
- We're changing again, guys!

334
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:23,785
- No. No cops.
- Well, what is this?

335
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,286
She died.
She's dead.

336
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:30,124
- It was Gilligan!
- <i>What?</i>

337
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,130
Gilligan killed
the skipper... stripper.

338
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,132
I didn't kill
any stripper.

339
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,327
- You're drunk. You don't remember.
- You're pulling the rip cord!

340
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:40,532
Ira, take my honeymoon tickets.
Get out of the country. Save yourself.

341
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,303
- I'm not drunk. Bix made me the designated driver.
- Bix!

342
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:46,709
<i>Just then, the stripper woke up...</i>

343
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:49,179
<i>saw Buster with what appeared</i>
<i>to be blood around his mouth...</i>

344
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:52,376
- <i>and thought she had killed him for groping her.</i>
- Not again.

345
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,892
You were setting me up.

346
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:03,019
You're trying to get me
to leave the country.

347
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,859
Well, the hell with you, sir.
Bix, we're leaving.

348
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,593
I'm testifying.

349
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:11,193
<i>Yeah, the party's over. That's it.</i>

350
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,272
You were trying
to set Ira up?

351
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:16,342
<i>Oh, Gob, Gob.</i>
<i>Come on. Is this true?</i>

352
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:19,071
Oh, wait a minute.
It wasn't your idea, Gob.

353
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:22,012
- It was your idea. Wasn't it, Dad?
- It wa...

354
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:24,549
- Huh?
- Even if it was my idea, which it wasn't...

355
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:28,246
Gob screwed it up,
which he did and always does.

356
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,754
- You don't have to take that.
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

357
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:34,189
Here.

358
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:41,097
- Oh, no. No, no. Don't you dare, mister.
- Do it. Do it.

359
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:43,795
<i>Hey, Gob! I am your best man.</i>
<i>I am your fath</i>...

360
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,974
What does it matter?
I screwed it up anyway. A complete failure.

361
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,875
<i>Can't even fake the death</i>
<i>of a stripper.</i>

362
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,642
Oh, come on.
That's not a bad thing.

363
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,378
- It doesn't make you a failure. Dad's the failure.
- <i>Really?</i>

364
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:02,455
When he was my age, he ran
an entire company, had kids.

365
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,820
The company was corrupt.
Look what he's trying to do to us.

366
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,825
<i>I'll tell you something else.</i>
<i>You might not be a father...</i>

367
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,918
but you are my brother.

368
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:14,391
I might be a father.

369
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:18,262
Why don't you start trusting
yourself. Okay? Not Dad.

370
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,339
You're a much better man
than he is.

371
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,238
- You're a better man than both of us.
- Well.

372
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:27,074
You're the best man.
You're my best man.

373
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,172
Not if I have an actual ceremony,
'cause Dad would kill me, but...

374
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:33,616
What do you say, <i>hermano?</i>
Help me clean up this mess?

375
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,585
What the hell.

376
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,950
Gob, I want out.

377
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,186
- I'm in love with your brother.
- What?

378
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,889
- You did it again, you son of a bitch!
- No, no! She's...

379
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,264
In-law. Tobias.

380
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,367
Sorry. I should have
finished that thought.

381
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:54,963
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

382
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,837
Oh, my god.
I killed Michael.

383
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:59,309
Yeah, but on the plus side,
you got punched in the face.

384
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:03,314
Hey, Brother.
Hey, Brother.

385
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,816
<i>Michael solves</i>
<i>the mystery of the missing money.</i>

386
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,787
Ira was signatory to all these accounts?

387
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,323
- Get me Ira Gilligan.
- <i>And Gilligan...</i>

388
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:15,451
<i>fulfills his destiny.</i>

389
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,121
<i>Let it ring.</i>

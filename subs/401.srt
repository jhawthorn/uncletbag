2
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:07,308
NARRATOR (gravelly):
It was May...

3
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:08,410
(clears throat)

4
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:09,898
It was May 4,

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,651
and in the bayside town
of Newport Beach,

6
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,111
the annual celebration

7
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:17,030
known as Cinco de Cuatro
was underway.

8
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:21,468
The holiday started as
a particularly vicious response

9
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:24,637
by a young Lucille Bluth
to the Mexican holiday...

10
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,973
- This still isn't made?
- ...of Cinco de Mayo.

11
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:30,185
- No, no, it's not. 
- Rosa, why is this still a mess?!

12
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:32,479
She said it's, uh,
it's Cinco de Mayo.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,720
She's taking, uh, the day off.

14
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,489
- She said that?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,991
- She called it Cinco de Mayo?
- She did, yeah.

16
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:39,702
Oh, why can't they
just call it May 5?

17
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:41,120
This is what
I was talking about.

18
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,705
It's all part
of the Mexican war on May 5.

19
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,426
- War on May 5, I know, yeah. It is. 
- It is.

20
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,542
NARRATOR:
But even a skeptical George Sr.

21
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,003
soon found himself feeling
similarly embattled.

22
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,671
Where the (bleep) are my socks?!

23
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:52,756
Now it's not so funny, is it?

24
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:54,758
No, not funny.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,677
We should start our own holiday.

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,930
NARRATOR: You see, the Hispanics
of Newport liked Cinco a lot,

27
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:03,475
but high up on Coast Highway,
Lucille Bluth did not.

28
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,437
Doesn't look like they'll be
done any time soon.

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,064
NARRATOR: And then Lucille had
a horrible thought,

30
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:12,568
a thought that was thoughtless
and better to not.

31
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,987
"What if," she thought
with a sneering grin...

32
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:19,950
Next year what if the party
didn't even begin?

33
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,870
NARRATOR: And so began
a holiday on the eve

34
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:24,788
- of the fifth of May...
- ♪ The cockroach... ♪

35
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,958
...originally intended
to deplete the party supplies

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,544
the Cinco de Mayo celebrants
were relying upon.

37
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,212
Fill the bay with chorizo.

38
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:34,715
- Chorizo dump! 
- NARRATOR: Over 30 years, however, it grew

39
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:37,217
and was soon embraced
by the Hispanic community...

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,594
You buy it, you break it!

41
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:39,637
...for financial reasons...

42
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,431
and as the celebrations peaked

43
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:46,018
with a boat parade
called the Festival of Lights--

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,770
another phrase
they wanted back--

45
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:51,273
one man was about
to hit his lowest point.

46
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:56,904
♪ On the sixth of May... ♪

47
00:01:56,946 --> 00:02:00,157
LUCILLE 2:
Happy Cuatro, happy Cuatro!

48
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,533
Let's throw
some more taco shells.

49
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:02,576
Olé!

50
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:03,953
Sally, can I...?

51
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:06,747
I need to speak
to Lucille 2, please.

52
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,750
It's okay, Sally,
I'll talk to Michael.

53
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,168
NARRATOR:
This is Lucille 2,

54
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,213
a longtime patron
of the Bluth family.

55
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:16,131
I'll be downstairs
kicking myself

56
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,467
for not marrying you
so many years ago.

57
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,220
Michael, do you have
something for me?

58
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,680
Does bad news count?

59
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,056
There's that Bluth wit.

60
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,975
Oh, I love your family.

61
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,559
NARRATOR: She certainly
had demonstrated that

62
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,687
with many of the men
in the family...

63
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,772
Oh, stop it,
you're making me dizzy.

64
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:34,233
...even having fallen
for a few,

65
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:37,486
although some of that was
the vertigo she suffered from.

66
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:38,821
But not all of it.

67
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:41,740
- Dad?
- No, no.

68
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:44,827
But seriously, she had gotten
intimate with Buster and Gob.

69
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:45,953
I need that money I lent you.

70
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:48,038
I am in the middle of a campaign

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,915
and I am desperate
for the ad money.

72
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:51,000
You're going to get it.

73
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,876
I just need an extension.

74
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:53,961
Why don't you go to your family?

75
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,838
I don't need them.

76
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,214
What I need is you.

77
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,675
What are you suggesting?

78
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:10,644
- (thud)
- No.

79
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:13,897
Okay, that was nasty.

80
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,482
- Aren't you sweet?
- (chuckles)

81
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:16,859
- Thank you.
- Okay.

82
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,988
Don't tilt your head, okay?

83
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,574
NARRATOR: And that's
when Michael debased himself.

84
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,742
What are you doing?

85
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:27,161
I'm gonna have sex
with you for money.

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,083
NARRATOR:
Later that night,

87
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,128
after Michael did
something unthinkable,

88
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,797
he was looking
for a place to hide

89
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:41,800
and he returned
to a long neglected model home

90
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,594
he believed to be empty.

91
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,181
GOB:
Thanks for coming

92
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:49,308
so late, Maria, I know
that you won't be cleaning up

93
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,727
tomorrow, and we did make
quite a mess of that bedroom.

94
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,562
Michael.

95
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,731
NARRATOR:
This is Michael's brother Gob.

96
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,524
Neither had expected
to see each other

97
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,651
after some recent
unpleasantness.

98
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,195
I didn't expect
to be seeing you again

99
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:03,572
after all the unpleasantness.

100
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,282
I-I've, I've,
I've been out of control.

101
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:06,909
Sorry.

102
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,327
In fact, I-I just did something
that I-I don't,

103
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:10,329
I don't, I don't know
why I did it.

104
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,705
Do you want to talk about it?

105
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:13,874
No, I do not,
I've said too much already.

106
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,042
You cannot help me.

107
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,043
Well, I wasn't hoping to help.

108
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,294
I was hoping to rub it in

109
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,171
because of all
the unpleasantness.

110
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:21,673
- Got it. - Oh, damn it, I meant
to throw these in the chipper.

111
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:24,259
God, I'm just not
into Cuatro this year.

112
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:26,136
I was the one that was wrong,
not you,

113
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:28,222
and besides, you could not
make me feel worse right now.

114
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:29,598
Well, I'd be willing

115
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,933
to let you have
your apology back

116
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:32,351
if you give me
the chance to try.

117
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:33,832
I mean, I'm gonna need
some specifics

118
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:35,270
about the thing
that you're ashamed of.

119
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:37,689
Otherwise I'll just be
taking general potshots.

120
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:43,612
Bad example: if you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

121
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,864
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

122
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,367
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

123
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,743
- It's not that.
- I said "Bad example."

124
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:51,161
I went to go see Lucille 2

125
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,623
and I just, I just-- 
I lost control.

126
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:56,416
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

127
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,252
You have got no idea how I feel.

128
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,962
Well, if you're talking about
doing something embarrassing

129
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,588
with a woman, then no, I don't.

130
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,090
NARRATOR:
But he should have.

131
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:04,967
It's almost
as if he found a way

132
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:08,220
to simulate amnesia.

133
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,305
Hey, I'm down
to my last Forget-Me-Now.

134
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,683
NARRATOR: In fact,
that is what he had done.

135
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:15,352
Hey, remember me?

136
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:17,104
NARRATOR:
Gob had always taken a pill

137
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,606
he called a Forget-Me-Now
for that...

138
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,275
- No más.
- ¿No más?

139
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,734
...but was commonly known
as a roofie.

140
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:23,735
GOB:
There's only one left.

141
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:25,237
How could that possibly be?

142
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,280
Unless... John Beard Jr.

143
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,990
I don't need to get into it.

144
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,783
I came here because I thought
the house was empty,

145
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,659
but I can go
somewhere else, okay?

146
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,288
- Hey, listen, Michael, if you
want, we can split this. - No,

147
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,206
I feel like this is something
that I shouldn't forget,

148
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,083
okay, and believe me,
this is the last time

149
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,210
I ever judge you for anything

150
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,211
that you ever do.

151
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,046
Oh, (bleep).

152
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,047
(door closes)

153
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,424
Is that who you were with?

154
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,301
I knew it, I always knew it.

155
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:48,927
- Take this, Michael, forget, forget. 
- No, no, no, no, no.

156
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,262
Put the mask back on.
Forget this, Michael.

157
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:52,431
- Forget, forget, Michael.
- Gob.

158
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:53,891
Forget, now is the time
to forget.

159
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:55,142
- (coughing)
- Now you're forgetting.

160
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:57,853
- Now you're forgetting.
- God.

161
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,396
♪ It's so easy to forget... ♪

162
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:00,772
(Michael sighs)

163
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,775
♪ It's so easy to forget. ♪

164
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,403
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

165
00:06:06,445 --> 00:06:08,363
NARRATOR:
Now, the story of a family

166
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:12,117
whose future was abruptly
canceled and the one son

167
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,203
who had no choice
but to keep himself together.

168
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,335
It's Michael's...

169
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:26,965
Six months
before the Forget-Me-Now,

170
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,009
Michael had made good
on a long-standing threat

171
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:30,802
to go to Phoenix,

172
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:34,932
and even though the Phoenix
he went to was online,

173
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,768
he still enjoyed
the full college experience

174
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:40,728
by living in a dorm room
while doing so.

175
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,232
George Michael, what is
my log-on password again?

176
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:45,317
NARRATOR: Unfortunately
it was his son's dorm room

177
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,110
at the University of California
at Irvine.

178
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:51,782
Dad, come on, what have we said
is the most important thing?

179
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:53,283
I have tried "family."

180
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,868
- It does not work for me.
- No, privacy.

181
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,120
NARRATOR:
This is Michael's son

182
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,831
George Michael-- a nice kid.

183
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:02,292
Uh, no one should have
your password but you.

184
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,835
I shouldn't even know it.

185
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:05,754
- You've made that point.
- Have I?

186
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,881
MICHAEL: My point is, we have
no secrets from each other.

187
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,384
We know everything there is
to know about each other.

188
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,385
We're like twins.

189
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,387
I don't see us as twins.

190
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:16,265
Yeah? You name me one way
in which we're different.

191
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:18,183
GEORGE MICHAEL:
I think you tend to be better

192
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:21,478
at feeling
like you belong places.

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,522
MICHAEL:
Do I?

194
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:29,027
I want you to start feeling
like you belong places.

195
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,153
Look at that guy.

196
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,364
He thinks he's a musician.

197
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,046
You know, like,
you've got to start having

198
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:36,326
a little bit better sense
of humor about yourself.

199
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,327
Look at me.

200
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:38,537
People say I don't age.

201
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:40,122
You know, like,
"Hey, look at that guy.

202
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:41,915
He's got the hair
of a teenager."

203
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:44,293
And I say, "Take your best shot"

204
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,169
because I think
that that's a good thing

205
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,879
because I'm self-effacing.

206
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,131
Hmm?

207
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,549
I want you to be able
to do that.

208
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,384
Well, it's hard
to be self-effacing

209
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:56,096
when you're a perfect specimen
of rugged manlessness.

210
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:57,097
(chuckles)

211
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,142
Well, you can't hear this, but,

212
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,727
but we're gonna work on it.

213
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,395
That's why I'm living
in your dorm.

214
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:04,837
Well, I thought
you were living here

215
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:06,440
because you had
nowhere else to go.

216
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, and because of the fact
you had this big double room

217
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,152
all to yourself
because of your name.

218
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,987
NARRATOR:
The name George Michael

219
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,781
did create confusion
in the campus housing office.

220
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,283
This guy's name is actually
George Michael.

221
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,451
No, it's two different guys.

222
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:20,245
- They're twins, ugly.
- (gasps)

223
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:22,205
BOTH: We should sign them up
for Twin Club.

224
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:25,292
And let's give them
the big handicap room.

225
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,960
Yeah, you see,
that's the other thing, is that

226
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,087
I kind of wanted to use
this time to almost kind of,

227
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,798
you know, wean off
of the name George Michael.

228
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,426
What?

229
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:37,179
I don't know, you know,
you get older, you do

230
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,514
a something search
of your own name...

231
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,433
NARRATOR: In George Michael's
case, you find this.

232
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:44,478
It was in this men's room in-- 
get this-- Beverly Hills

233
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,897
that singer George Michael
was arrested

234
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:50,025
for soliciting sex
from an undercover cop.

235
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,028
Well, it was your mother's idea
to call you George Michael,

236
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,196
you know, and I think
it was just

237
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,864
so that we didn't confuse you

238
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:58,116
with your Uncle George or
your Grandfather George.

239
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:00,786
- Right. 
- I got it, let's call you Boy George.

240
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:01,787
WOMAN:
Singer Boy George

241
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:02,788
in the news again today,

242
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:03,872
this time for sexual assault

243
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,874
in a men's public bathroom.

244
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,125
Beatrix Hebberly-Sneed,
Wee BBC 2.

245
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,960
GEORGE MICHAEL:
You know, I think

246
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:11,129
I'll, I'll just-- 
I'll stick with George Michael.

247
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,964
I mean, at least
it was consensual.

248
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:15,133
But I guess the, uh,
the bigger point

249
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,344
I'm making is just that,
uh, it's hard to have

250
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:19,179
any privacy
now that they've stuck me

251
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,431
- with an actual roommate.
- Well, you know, listen,

252
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,850
I'm all for kicking P-Hound out,
you know that.

253
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,061
Well, you know, I didn't
really mean privacy from him.

254
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,105
I know, I know, I know.

255
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,901
You want your space from me?

256
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:34,403
Um, look,

257
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:38,198
listen, hey, hey,
look, look, listen.

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,325
Listen, look it.

259
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,161
Are you listening?
You want your space.

260
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:44,454
I get it.

261
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,916
I did not mean
to crowd you, pal.

262
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,961
Listen, I thought that this was,
that this was fun, and,

263
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:53,088
- and it is okay if you didn't
see it that way. - Oh, Dad.

264
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,132
Buddy, it's not like
I don't have someplace to go.

265
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:57,300
You know, I'll just go
right back to the model home.

266
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,094
They don't have Internet there,
so I'll just put

267
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:00,971
the law school on, on, on pause.

268
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:02,597
It's not like the first time
that I've done that.

269
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,641
You know, last time I did that,
you were born. You know what?

270
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,309
Screw it, maybe I'll just go
to the real Phoenix

271
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:07,936
and finish school.

272
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,229
They got one in Costa Mesa.

273
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:11,022
Plus they want me
for an article.

274
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:12,399
Media wants to talk
to Daddy about the real

275
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:13,984
estate business,
and once they do that,

276
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,694
- I'm gonna be right back on top.
- (groans)

277
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,195
You know what?
This is your school rally shirt.

278
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:19,072
You know, same size--medium.

279
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:21,032
Do you know where mine is? We
wear the same size like twi...

280
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,410
We're just like twin-- 
couple of identical...

281
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,120
Dad, Dad, no, I...

282
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:28,623
Look, I was not talking
about privacy from you per se.

283
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:33,128
I was talking about my software.

284
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,588
What's that?

285
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,215
It's privacy software.

286
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:38,633
That's why the word came up.

287
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,385
It's not why the word came up.

288
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:42,345
But George Michael
was writing code

289
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:44,181
for a block software

290
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:46,683
with his roommate
that was proving challenging.

291
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,143
...you're leaving a hole

292
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:49,728
just right in the middle
of the block.

293
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,063
Both because of online threats
to his privacy...

294
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,025
Otherwise, people will be
able to hack in through

295
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:56,151
a mobile platform portal, and
it won't be a block anything 3G.

296
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:58,361
...and some in-room threats
to his privacy, as well.

297
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:00,322
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

298
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:01,656
No, we're just right
in the middle of this software.

299
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,450
Great, good.
Give me the lappy.

300
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:05,285
I'll hit save for you.
I got to Skype with my advisor

301
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,162
in Phoenix, and if I don't
get on right now,

302
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:11,500
he's gonna have to Skype me
from a T.G.I. Friday's.

303
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,502
- Oh.
- Yeah.

304
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:15,045
Whew.

305
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:16,379
'Cause that hurt for a second.

306
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,048
I was like, he wants me to go.

307
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:20,091
- No, no, no, no, no.
- But no. Yeah? No.

308
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,259
- Software.
- No.

309
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,469
I mean, yeah, I may need

310
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,596
some privacy, you know,
to work on it,

311
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:29,226
and that might mean...
you going.

312
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:33,688
Oh, you mean here.

313
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,357
Yeah, clearing out.

314
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,067
An hour, here, there. Yes?

315
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:38,401
Got it. Not a problem.
You give me a little

316
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,445
fair warning,
I clear right out of here.

317
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:42,239
Let's schedule it now.
We can do it.

318
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,740
I need help with
the calendar though.

319
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:46,368
It's, like, stuck on 2003.

320
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,369
- Help me just break into...
- You just hit "today."

321
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,080
- The "today" button.
- Sorry. It's stuck in 2003,

322
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,248
so I don't have "today."

323
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:52,290
I need to jump forward...

324
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,750
No, I know, there's a button

325
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,460
- that says "today."
- Yeah, this has no button.

326
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:56,628
Anyway, you know,
I'm just gonna run downstairs

327
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,546
and, uh, grab a bite.

328
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,714
Wait, I want to go.

329
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:01,216
(chuckles)

330
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:02,551
Let me go. I'll go. I'm hungry.

331
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:04,553
Come on.

332
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:08,473
NARRATOR: Michael Bluth
was fitting right in

333
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,141
with his son's
college experience.

334
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:11,768
Be good for you, huh?

335
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,853
Gettable, right?

336
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:15,522
Hey, tell me about
the software thing.

337
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,107
This is the Faceblock thing
you were working on?

338
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:18,108
Is it like Facebook?

339
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:19,859
Uh, well, no.

340
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,486
It's kind of the opposite
of Facebook, you know.

341
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,488
Facebook connects you
with everyone,

342
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,657
this blocks you from everyone.

343
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,034
Oh, okay. Kind of like
the antisocial network, right?

344
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:29,703
- That's very good.
- You can use it.

345
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,246
I don't understand
the Internet stuff.

346
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:33,665
You give me all the parts
and you tell me to build

347
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,917
a television set, I can
bang that out, but I, you know,

348
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,999
I can't get the right day
to display on my calendar.

349
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:39,963
- Just press "today."
- Yeah, just tried that.

350
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,756
Doesn't work on mine, pal.

351
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,675
This is very, very, very
exciting, you know,

352
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:46,761
because once they come out
with that article on me

353
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,680
in that in-flight magazine,

354
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:50,890
now, the family's gonna be
right back on top.

355
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:53,100
- The guy's doing a whole spread on me. 
- In-flight magazine?

356
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,686
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's called Altitude.

357
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:55,895
It's for OutWest Airlines.

358
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:57,063
Next to SkyMall, it's, like,

359
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,732
the number two most read
in all of coach.

360
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:00,191
Well, three with
the safety card,

361
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,902
but get a lot of attention
for Sudden Valley.

362
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:04,946
And then with your Internet
company, it's gonna be like--

363
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:06,948
we're gonna have two businesses,
you know?

364
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,658
And yours sounds like
such a natural.

365
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,785
I mean, no one likes
to share their identity.

366
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:11,995
- Right?
- Well...

367
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,120
Okay, give me
your meal plan card.

368
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:14,748
I'm gonna run in there,

369
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:16,041
I'm gonna grab a tray,
you run around back,

370
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,042
make sure you get there in time,

371
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,168
before my hand stamp dries.

372
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,169
Okay?

373
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,128
Here we go.

374
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:23,173
Michael had a right
to be excited.

375
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:25,592
It had been many years
since the Bluth family

376
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,552
had had any business success.

377
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:31,806
Not since Michael's mother
Lucille had sold off a quarter

378
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:35,018
of the company just before the
onset of the great dark period.

379
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,270
But after examining
the company's prospects...

380
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:40,147
Are those police boats?

381
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,900
Lucille 2.

382
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,568
...Stan Sitwell
quickly divested himself.

383
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,196
How'd you like to be bumped up
to Lucille 1?

384
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,155
So the Bluth family
had a new stakeholder,

385
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:50,992
while the old one,
who knew she'd be implicated

386
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,786
in some of
the family's misdeeds...

387
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:54,746
You boys know
how to shovel coal?

388
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:57,624
...headed out on whatever the
opposite of a maiden voyage is.

389
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,708
(ship horn blows)

390
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,086
Michael, however, made a pledge

391
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,797
not to get pulled
into the drama

392
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:06,925
and to let the family
keep themselves all together,

393
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,677
- for a while.
- ...for a while.

394
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:10,679
And he set off to sea, even as

395
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,056
his mother mysteriously
turned back.

396
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,934
Why the alleged ship-jacker
changed direction

397
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,560
is still unexplained.

398
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,979
But what is known
is that many of the charges

399
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,607
against this seaward matriarch
will fall under

400
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,236
the dominion of the little
understood maritime law.

401
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,613
And soon,
the hearing drew near...

402
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,073
Well, I missed the hearing.

403
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:31,783
...and then passed.

404
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,660
Oh, it just snuck up on me,
and then they called,

405
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,370
and they wanted me there
at eight bells.

406
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,914
You know, I thought
that was their 5:00 p.m.

407
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,041
By the time I got back,
the courtroom was

408
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,001
reverted back
to the crab restaurant.

409
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:43,670
"Eight bells" refers
to a watch length.

410
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,004
It's maritime law.

411
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:47,090
Yes, Michael returned
after all.

412
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,050
You know, one bell is struck
after 30 minutes, two bells...

413
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,385
It seems Michael
had been interested

414
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:53,138
in maritime law
since playing a lawyer

415
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,056
in an original school play

416
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:57,684
titled The Trial
of Captain Hook.

417
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,269
♪ You're a crook,
Captain Hook... ♪

418
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,104
Prior to this,
his only dream had been

419
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,605
to possess the power of flight.

420
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:05,066
But that one turned out to be

421
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,609
not as much fun as he thought.

422
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,862
Watch out for the seal!

423
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:09,863
(crowd gasps)

424
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,698
Loose seal! Loose seal!

425
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,658
I'm watching!

426
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,076
(crowd gasps)

427
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:18,079
You're out of the play!

428
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,039
That's why, at sea, a watch with
no incidents is described as

429
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:21,374
"eight bells and all is well."

430
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,877
Wow, maybe you should be
the maritime lawyer.

431
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:24,961
This is what I've been saying.

432
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,296
Because I did go to law school

433
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:27,756
with an emphasis
on maritime law.

434
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:29,758
Oh, your one year of law school

435
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,676
is going to beat Barry's three?

436
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:33,261
It's ridiculous.

437
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:34,345
We'll hire the best.

438
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:35,346
And who's gonna pay

439
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:36,848
for the best, Mom?

440
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,141
We have money from
selling some shares.

441
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:40,101
Plus, we got
that stimulus package.

442
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:41,352
What are you talking about?

443
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:43,021
That money is spent.

444
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:46,149
I just bought 4,000 acres
of California desert.

445
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,150
Time-out.

446
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:48,693
Hang on.

447
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,361
- What's this?
- Yeah. (clears throat)

448
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:53,406
I'm gonna be moving there
for a little while.

449
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:56,159
Old big bear's not gonna be
around much anymore.

450
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,161
- I don't care about that.
- He's in denial.

451
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,662
- We're getting divorced!
- Your mother and I

452
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:00,663
are getting a divorce.

453
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,040
(screams, gasps)

454
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,002
I want to know...

455
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:09,047
(whimpering)

456
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,760
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

457
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:16,679
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

458
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,348
You don't consider
that finished?

459
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:21,309
So the family got
a little stimmy.

460
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,144
Don't make a federal case
out of it.

461
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,730
That is exactly what they're
going to make out of it.

462
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,315
And when you say "family,"
you mean our family?

463
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:28,691
They've already got
their hooks in it?

464
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,026
Buster, no offense.

465
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:31,027
None taken.

466
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:32,487
Oh, I keep losing my jewels.

467
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,906
Michael, you never
accept help from anyone.

468
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:36,991
That's why we didn't cut you in.

469
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,409
We didn't want to demean you.

470
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,829
It's like tipping
an African-American.

471
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,248
You wouldn't tip
an African-American, would you?

472
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,250
Of course I would.

473
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,418
On a train?

474
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,878
What...

475
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,839
Did you know about all this?

476
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,174
No, I've been tipping them.

477
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,509
Even a waiter?

478
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:56,427
Okay, the treadmill's
up and running.

479
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:58,721
We got the door on,
and we were able

480
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,932
to match the faux on the paint.

481
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,480
Thank you so much
for your hard work.

482
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:13,862
So long.

483
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:17,866
Michael, we can't
give you that money.

484
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:19,367
We got to keep you clean.

485
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,119
You're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

486
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,245
Let me get this straight.

487
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:24,122
I still have to do all the work

488
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:26,958
as the president of the company,
but I can't use any of the money

489
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,210
for the company, and you won't
let me help with your case,

490
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,379
but you'd still like for me
to testify at your trial.

491
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,964
Is that right?

492
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:35,508
I just want you to say
I was a loving mother.

493
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,885
And now perjury.

494
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,219
Hey, it wasn't easy to get

495
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,555
Lucille 2 to keep you on
as president.

496
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,141
- I'll be sure to thank her.
- Don't thank her.

497
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:45,310
She doesn't have
enough shares to stop us.

498
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,270
Hmm.

499
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,314
And that's how Michael
found a way

500
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,315
to finish
Sudden Valley himself.

501
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,859
- Hello.
- Hello.

502
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:57,030
He simply traded his shares of
the Bluth company to Lucille 2.

503
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,740
I hold on to Sudden Valley;
it's like a pet project...

504
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:00,158
- Getting himself out,
- Thank you so much.

505
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,201
and giving the balance of power

506
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:05,330
to a woman who had
no power of balance.

507
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:06,789
- (gasps)
- Oh.

508
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,458
(grunts)

509
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:11,836
And for the first time,
he didn't feel he needed

510
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:15,298
to tell his family
he was done with them.

511
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,841
But he did anyway.

512
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:19,177
You know what,
I am done with this family.

513
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,803
I hope you've saved some money,

514
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,889
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

515
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,140
What's this?

516
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:26,893
And with his newfound wealth,

517
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:29,228
Michael was not only able
to send his son off

518
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,397
- Get out of here!
- to a bright future

519
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:34,025
in college,
with the family car...

520
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:37,528
...he was also able to finish

521
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,157
the long-delayed housing
development Sudden Valley,

522
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:46,245
but this time,
under his own company name.

523
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:47,872
Maybe I can give you a tip.

524
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,499
Might want to put a road
up to this place.

525
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,167
Well, we paved the neighborhood.

526
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,169
Just waiting for the city
to build a road to it.

527
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:55,380
And although his mother's
day in court was something

528
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:59,550
both he and his college-bound
son would miss,

529
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:02,095
Michael truly felt
that nothing could go wrong.

530
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:04,472
And then something did.

531
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,307
(rumbling)

532
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,476
Not that.
That happens all the time.

533
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:10,061
This.

534
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:12,522
The collapse of the California
housing market

535
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:15,984
is taking a personal toll with
cutbacks here at the station.

536
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,361
And since the main Internet
and information cable

537
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:22,073
had been severed when the
community pool was installed,

538
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:25,410
Michael suddenly found himself
living in a ghost town

539
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:27,453
he himself built.

540
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,878
Well, that's not a great sign.

541
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,131
(vulture squawks)

542
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:40,550
(plane passing overhead)

543
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:50,059
This is why you don't
confide in a competitor.

544
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,728
(vulture squawks)

545
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,480
NARRATOR:
Michael was desperate to cover

546
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,232
his copious building costs...

547
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:57,442
Just till I get on my feet.

548
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:59,152
...so he returned to a woman

549
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,487
he could count on
to put off his downfall.

550
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,322
- I got you!
- Just as he could count on

551
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:05,366
her putting him off
and falling down.

552
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,784
You did. Bye-bye.

553
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:08,161
Oop.

554
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:10,413
That's a hot mess.

555
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,165
But weeks
stretched into months,

556
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,666
and the situation got bleaker.

557
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,586
(wind whistling)

558
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:19,547
And it was either this
that made him lose hope...

559
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,760
(weakly):
Love each other.

560
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,595
Pete! Pete!

561
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:28,473
...or possibly it was
the death of that mailman...

562
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:29,515
Wait here.

563
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,808
Hang on, Pete!

564
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,809
...but Michael finally gave up.

565
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:33,227
I got one bar!

566
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,896
And having alienated

567
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:36,522
everyone else in the family,

568
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:38,691
turned to the one person
he had left.

569
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:42,361
I thought we'd have Thanksgiving
here for your senior year.

570
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:44,906
I don't have a kitchen.

571
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,949
Oh, these are my clothes.

572
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:50,578
Pete died.

573
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,497
God.

574
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:56,542
And so Michael moved into
his son's college dorm room.

575
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,837
You are kidding me.

576
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,380
They're gonna be
in seat backs today?

577
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:02,423
That is great news.

578
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,300
Which, in the new economy,

579
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,344
wasn't as unusual a phenomenon
as you might think.

580
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,304
Don't go through my stuff,
Granddad.

581
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,765
Hey, who do you think
paid for your stuff?

582
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,767
Excuse me. Sorry. Do you know
where George Michael is?

583
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,393
Um, he's in the computer lab.

584
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,895
Great.

585
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,939
- There's a computer lab?
- There's a computer lab?

586
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,940
Huh.

587
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,691
I'm putting up a wall.

588
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,277
We need to rework
our whole system here.

589
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,196
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

590
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,489
Hey. How'd you find me?

591
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,449
Uh, Trang's grandfather.

592
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:31,494
Boy, shoot me if I'm 86, living
in my grandson's dorm, huh?

593
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,538
Pal, good news.

594
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,373
The article that they did on me
in Altitude magazine

595
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:36,374
comes out today.

596
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:38,251
You're in Attitude?

597
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:39,877
That magazine is gay.

598
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,463
Oh, he wasn't being flip
with the word "gay."

599
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:45,675
Attitude is a British magazine
for homosexuals.

600
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:47,260
Altitude.

601
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:48,886
It is OutWest Airlines'
in-flight magazine.

602
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,929
Can I see it?

603
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:51,681
Probably doesn't have it.

604
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,724
Try finding a flight at this
time of the year. (laughs)

605
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,477
You ever even been on a plane,
you piece of (bleep)?

606
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:00,189
So can I see it?

607
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,234
It-it is not in the terrestrial
newsstands just yet.

608
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:04,944
Guess what though. You,
my friend, are in the article.

609
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:06,863
- I'm in it?
- You're in it, you're in it.

610
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:08,906
I mentioned you; I mentioned
that I'm living in your dorm.

611
00:22:08,948 --> 00:22:11,367
I thought that it might help
with your popularity problem.

612
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,744
Well, I'm gonna get going

613
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:15,621
- while the room is empty, so...
- Okay. Great.

614
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:16,998
See you later.

615
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,679
Boy, that's got to
drive you crazy, right?

616
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,876
The whole reason you had to come

617
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,668
to the computer lab
was for privacy.

618
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:24,005
It's no wonder you can't
get a real girl up there.

619
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,549
Michael was referring
to something he'd walked in on

620
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,009
a few days earlier.

621
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,510
There's a girl in there.

622
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:31,846
There is?

623
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:33,890
Where the hell is
George Michael?

624
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,682
- Excuse me. Hello. Oh.
- Dad.

625
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:36,726
- Hi.
- Yeah.

626
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:37,894
There's nobody in here.

627
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:39,729
Buddy, bad news.

628
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,606
P-Hound is yanking
our chain again.

629
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,316
- Uncle Michael.
- Oh, my God.

630
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:44,442
- Hi.
- Hello there.

631
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:47,445
There is a kind of girl here.

632
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,030
Didn't say it was your cousin.

633
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:50,406
Well, he doesn't know.

634
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:51,698
Now, that's smart.

635
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:54,368
Let him think
there's a girl in here.

636
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,329
Actually, we've been talking
about how crowded that room is,

637
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,874
and P-Hound was suggesting that
maybe we, maybe we do a vote

638
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,708
to see who stays
in the dorm room.

639
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,544
He suggested that?
Are you serious?

640
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:06,464
Well, the thing is that the room
is only sanctioned for two.

641
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:07,673
Right, and we have a vote.

642
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:08,925
He's gone in two seconds.

643
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,676
Ah.

644
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:12,053
Two against one, right?

645
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:13,971
- Well, actually...
- We got to do it.

646
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,599
The thing is that it kind of
puts me in an awkward position.

647
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,309
- Hi.
- Hey.

648
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,061
Because since there's only
three people voting,

649
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:22,688
everyone's gonna know
who voted against who.

650
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,565
Well, what about if your
"girlfriend" wants to move in.

651
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:25,691
That way, she gets a vote.

652
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:26,776
(laughs)

653
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:28,361
I'm just here for tutoring.

654
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:29,820
She's not my girlfriend,
she's my cousin.

655
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:30,905
I'm not attracted to him.

656
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:32,573
Well, why's that even an issue?

657
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:34,909
P-Hound doesn't know
any of that stuff. Okay?

658
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:37,703
He'll just think that her vote's
the vote that got him out.

659
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:40,581
Well, wouldn't my girlfriend
want to get rid of my father?

660
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:41,999
- I'm not your girlfriend.
- Not your girlfriend.

661
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,960
No, but he doesn't know that.

662
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,628
No, well, someone's got to vote
for me, that's right.

663
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,963
Otherwise, it's suspicious.

664
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:48,714
We don't want
a palace coup, right?

665
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:50,341
- Well, I'll vote you out.
- Yeah, I will.

666
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:51,801
- Happy to do it.
- I wouldn't make you do that.

667
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:53,344
You know, then I fall down
a flight of stairs,

668
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:54,428
I crack my head open,
you feel bad

669
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,513
about yourself your whole life.

670
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:56,889
And perhaps it was the chair

671
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,724
that fooled Michael
into thinking

672
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,726
his next idea was a good one.

673
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:03,646
What if I vote myself out?

674
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:05,398
You'd do that?

675
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,607
How would that help?

676
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,442
It's simple algebra.

677
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:10,903
You two vote against P-Hound,
nobody knows who did what,

678
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:13,030
because there's a vote
against me in there,

679
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,116
and it's adios, brothiero.

680
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:16,867
It cannot fail.

681
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:19,120
Michael was pleased
with his plan.

682
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,830
Won't that make it a tie?

683
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:21,831
Briefly.

684
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,374
Hmm?

685
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,001
I mean, if the two of us
vote against P-Hound,

686
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,961
and you and P-Hound
vote against you,

687
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:28,921
then it's two against two,
right?

688
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:31,716
Wow, you think, you think
that'd he'd vote against me?

689
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:33,092
I mean...

690
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:34,927
Um...

691
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,387
All right, new plan.

692
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:38,055
The details of the plan

693
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:39,890
continued to develop
through lunch.

694
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:41,392
MICHAEL:
So we got two scenarios.

695
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:43,436
It's either two votes
against P-Hound,

696
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:45,146
one vote against Maeby,
one against me,

697
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:48,607
with that vote being my own;
or if it's two votes against me,

698
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:50,192
then clearly
P-Hound is being nasty,

699
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:52,403
that triggers a recount,
and then it's a P-Hound blitz.

700
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:53,904
We all vote against P-Hound,
he's gone.

701
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,114
Mm-hmm.

702
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:56,823
What if whoever loses...

703
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:58,075
Yeah?

704
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:00,036
...refuses to go?

705
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:02,455
You think P-Hound would do that?

706
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:03,914
Okay, new plan.

707
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:05,583
And so the planning
continued through

708
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:07,793
what should have been
organic chemistry.

709
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,962
MICHAEL:
We all pack ahead of time,

710
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,757
really pack a bag, so it doesn't
look rigged, you know?

711
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:14,383
And then the loser,
straight out the door.

712
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,842
I mean, that's-that's the deal.

713
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:17,636
You know, that's the cost
of having a vote,

714
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:18,637
that's the price of freedom.

715
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,097
You know, maybe it's...

716
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,640
maybe it's better
if we're all just

717
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:22,975
direct with each other,
you know?

718
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:24,518
Just-just say
what's on our minds.

719
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,062
Yeah, I think it's gonna
come out anyway.

720
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:30,566
Um, Dad, you know, I-I've really
loved living with you...

721
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:31,609
No talking.

722
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,488
No talking
once the votes come in.

723
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,156
You're just right out the door.
That's the missing piece.

724
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:38,824
That's it.

725
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:40,659
This plan is foolproof.

726
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:43,454
Oh, I've cherished this,
too, pal.

727
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:44,997
Yeah. I mean, how many,
how many fathers

728
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,916
get to go to college
with their kid, huh?

729
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:49,043
So obviously
this is what happened.

730
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:51,878
Michael read
his own vote first.

731
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:54,924
First vote to remove...

732
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:56,092
Michael.

733
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:57,760
Huh, what are you gonna do?

734
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:02,223
Second vote to remove...

735
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,102
...Michael.

736
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:09,772
Michael expected this,
but didn't expect the sting.

737
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,690
Wow.

738
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:15,194
Obviously, if there's a tie,
there's an immediate runoff.

739
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:17,904
Third vote to remove...

740
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:21,200
...Michael.

741
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:30,668
(quietly): Did you mean
to write "George Michael"?

742
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:33,629
Obviously, the verdict was in.

743
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:35,673
And it's hard to know exactly

744
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:37,508
why Michael opened
the fourth ballot.

745
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,512
Was it out of hope
or confusion?

746
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:44,765
Either way, it couldn't be
what he wanted to read.

747
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:08,205
Michael did the only thing
he could think of

748
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,791
that would save face.

749
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,644
(jet engine roars)

750
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:33,772
NARRATOR: Michael had just been
stunned by some bad news.

751
00:27:33,814 --> 00:27:35,649
And with nowhere to go,
he decided

752
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:38,444
to pick up a copy of Altitude
to lift his spirits.

753
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:39,945
- Hi. Hello.
- Hey.

754
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:41,530
Where you heading today, sir?

755
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,199
Well, actually,
I just wanted a copy

756
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,451
of your in-flight magazine
Altitude.

757
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:47,453
Ah, this is ticketing.

758
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:49,580
You can get the magazine
on the flight.

759
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:52,291
I get it. But I'm actually-- 
I'm in the magazine.

760
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,751
How many bags?

761
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:56,295
Oh, I'm not checking these.

762
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:57,338
Ah, sorry, you actually

763
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:58,923
can't carry those on board.

764
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:00,716
Let me start over.

765
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,843
Uh, I-I am the star of
Altitude magazine this month--

766
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:04,762
or quarter, actually.

767
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:07,515
It's an April-September issue,
and I just wanted to get a copy.

768
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:08,933
I'm not flying anywhere.

769
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,351
Why do you have suitcases?

770
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:11,644
Those are irrelevant.

771
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:12,728
Not to me.

772
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,688
Okay.

773
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,733
I was mistakenly voted out of
a four-person housing situation,

774
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:20,486
uh, in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

775
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:21,862
Does that clear it up for you?

776
00:28:21,904 --> 00:28:24,365
What do you mean
by "mistakenly"?

777
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:26,534
I voted against myself to spare
my son the embarrassment

778
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,495
of, of having to vote
his own father out of his dorm.

779
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:30,704
That's all.

780
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:32,331
But that leaves
three other votes.

781
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:33,499
Yeah.

782
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,376
Can I get a copy
of the magazine, please?

783
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:37,753
No, I'm sorry,
they're actually for passengers.

784
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,505
We don't even give out
honey nuts, so we're not gonna

785
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:41,674
- give you a magazine.
- Who wants honey nuts?

786
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:42,883
I don't want the honey nuts.

787
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,218
I want to just jump
onto the plane,

788
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,427
- grab a magazine.
- Oh, okay,

789
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:46,845
yeah, sure, we just, uh,
let people walk

790
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,389
onto the plane all the time.

791
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,933
- Do you want a box cutter also?
- (laughter)

792
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:52,560
- Oh.
- Nice.

793
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:54,478
These guys are jerks.

794
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,729
Take that, take that.

795
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:58,482
Enjoy.

796
00:28:58,524 --> 00:28:59,733
Tell you what-- 
give me a one- way ticket

797
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,819
to your cheapest destination,
please.

798
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,363
Oh, you lucked out.

799
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,323
Today it's Pittsburgh.

800
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:08,659
He's good.

801
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:10,452
What's the second cheapest?

802
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:12,413
NARRATOR: So Michael ended up
spending a little more

803
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:14,248
to fly a little less,

804
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,584
and after some confusion
at security...

805
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,876
But you've got nothing
in your luggage.

806
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:18,961
I wasn't supposed to be
traveling today.

807
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,546
I told you, it was

808
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:21,630
a voting situation, there was a
miscalculation.

809
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:22,923
Well, I mean, obviously

810
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:24,508
P-Hound's gonna vote
against you.

811
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,302
- I've never seen nothing...
- These three people with burkas

812
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:28,012
just walked right by you.

813
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:30,389
...he found his seat.

814
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:33,475
Unfortunately the seat
he was assigned didn't have

815
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,394
a seat back pocket.

816
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:38,522
Hello, hi,
does each ticket entitle

817
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:40,274
the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

818
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:41,775
No, it only guarantees you
a seat.

819
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:43,777
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

820
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,863
or if I'd rather, you can.

821
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:48,741
NARRATOR: Michael had
to go back four seats

822
00:29:48,782 --> 00:29:51,118
before someone would.

823
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:58,834
And Michael kicked himself
for a pose

824
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:02,046
he thought would express
humility to Sanjiv,

825
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:05,007
the Altitude photographer.

826
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:07,509
And so Michael--

827
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:10,429
a man who'd for years
threatened to leave

828
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:13,807
his family but had always
stayed for his son,

829
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,811
a man who no longer had that
excuse nor anywhere to live--

830
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:20,356
found himself
with nothing to lose

831
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:22,983
in a town
that he'd always imagined

832
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:25,027
would be his destiny,

833
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:28,572
and for the first time
in many years,

834
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:30,616
Michael had hope.

835
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,832
Michael steps out
of the air-conditioned airport.

836
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:41,835
Hope you know a good place
to live because I'm...

837
00:30:41,877 --> 00:30:44,421
Ooh, dear Lord.

838
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:45,964
(chuckles)
'Cause I'm looking

839
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:47,800
- to make a new start.
- Don't touch that handle.

840
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:49,134
Whoa, Mother of God!

841
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:51,095
Dear Lord!

842
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,513
Whoo!

843
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:54,515
NARRATOR:
And Michael returns

844
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:58,435
to the only viable place
he can think of to live...

845
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:00,771
Gentlemen, start your engines.

846
00:31:00,813 --> 00:31:03,565
...where he begins his new life
cleaning up

847
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,567
after his family's old one.

848
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,152
Buster.

849
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:11,448
No... no, Gob.

850
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,450
- (ostrich screeches)
- Oh!

851
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,494
NARRATOR:
It was Lindsay.

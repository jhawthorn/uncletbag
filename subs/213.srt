1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:05,404
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,421
<i>Michael Bluth had gotten up early...</i>

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,514
<i>in the hopes of avoiding his family.</i>

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,652
<i>His mother, however, was already dressed,</i>
<i>made up and waiting for him</i>-

8
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,856
- <i>Good morning.</i>
- Ooh!

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,059
<i>Which put her wake-up time</i>
<i>in the 3:00, 3:30 area.</i>

10
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,365
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>
<i>I always get this way before Motherboy.</i>

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,701
Oh, God.
It's Motherboy already?

12
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:45,073
<i>Motherboy was a dinner dance</i>
<i>aimed at promoting mother-son bonding.</i>

13
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,705
<i>Lucille had gone</i>
<i>over 25 times with Buster...</i>

14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,342
<i>and on a few occasions,</i>
<i>had won Cutest Couple.</i>

15
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,353
<i>As one entered sexual maturity,</i>
<i>and the other one left it...</i>

16
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,389
<i>it became harder to win.</i>

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,857
- I'm so hot.
- If you were hot, Mother, we would win.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,293
<i>It's not just Motherboy.</i>
<i>It's Motherboy XXX!</i>

19
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,958
- And I think with you, I've got a shot.
- Oh, no.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,333
- Buster, for the first time ever,
doesn't want to do this?
- No, he does.

21
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,565
It's just,
he's been so mopey.

22
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,642
That could have something to do
with the fact that a seal ate his hand.

23
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,541
- I don't know what it is.
- I think that's what it is.

24
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,308
- Who knows?
- <i>It was that.</i>

25
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>It had happened weeks earlier when Buster</i>
<i>went swimming in the ocean...</i>

26
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,448
<i>against his mother's wishes.</i>

27
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,888
<i>He had become haunted by the loss...</i>

28
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,791
<i>seeing reminders of the accident everywhere.</i>

29
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:49,240
<i>Mother, I can't sleep. I may not be able</i>
<i>to go to dance practice today.</i>

30
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,139
I'm going out. Zip me up.

31
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,303
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>look how he zips now.</i>

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,041
I know what this is. You're embarrassed
by him, aren't you?

33
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,083
You spent your whole life
over-mothering the guy...

34
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,414
and when he finally needs you,
you're not there.

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,420
Well, I don't see you
spending time with him.

36
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,014
<i>The Bluth children had been</i>
<i>uneasy about missing limbs...</i>

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,618
<i>since their father used a one-armed man</i>
<i>to teach them lessons.</i>

38
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,163
That's why you don't yell.

39
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:16,326
As a matter of fact, I'm going to see Buster today.

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,428
So you're gonna have to find a different
dance partner for Motherboy.

41
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,100
God. Not that "I'm in love
with my mother" dance thing.

42
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,269
I'm so glad there wasn't one of
those for daddies and daughters.

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,871
- Of course they have father-daughter dances.
- They do? He never took me?

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,714
It was before we did your nose.
Toodle-oo.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,789
- You're up awful early.
- Well, my marriage is falling apart.

46
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,792
- Tobias is back with Carl.
- <i>Tobias had gotten a call...</i>

47
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,057
<i>from his one-time acting</i>
<i>teacher, Carl Weathers.</i>

48
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,295
He's directing something for TV,
but he thinks he might have a part for me.

49
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:53,805
<i>If this takes off, I might be able to buy you</i>
<i>the happiness that you deserve.</i>

50
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,933
He said the same thing when he got cast as
Frightened Inmate Number Two...

51
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,170
in that film he got fired from.

52
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,238
<i>He had even gotten a vanity plate</i>
<i>made up announcing the achievement.</i>

53
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,477
<i>And this wasn't the first time.</i>

54
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,725
He's so clueless.
He's not your real "take charge" husband.

55
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,818
Lindsay, you're still looking
for somebody like Daddy, okay?

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,559
Let's not forget that he was also
dismissive and disinterested.

57
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,658
No. No, he had good qualities.

58
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,567
<i>Actually, George Sr. Was secretly living...</i>

59
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,164
- <i>in the attic above them</i>
<i>and was starved for company</i>-
- Nellie.

60
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,708
Now-

61
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,335
who wants to take their top off?

62
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,006
<i>when George Michael and Maeby came in.</i>

63
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,243
<i>So you and Ann are actually going on</i>
<i>a Christian camping trip?</i>

64
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,446
It's called the Promise Land.
You're supposed to make promises...

65
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,719
about your relationship as a tribute to
the generations that preceded you.

66
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,726
Hey, there's booze in this.

67
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,296
That's the Promise Land
that Ann's taking you to?

68
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,729
You're gonna need this
more than Polly here.

69
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,202
- <i>That one's Polly?</i>
- Hey! What are you kids doin' up here?

70
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,705
We're lookin' for the camping stuff. Do you
know where the pump is for the air mattress?

71
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:05,209
I had to take all pumps
out of here a long time ago.

72
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,108
Take this down to
the kitchen, will you?

73
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,272
I think it's getting too risky
keeping you up here.

74
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,044
You know what's risky?
Lettin' your son go on that church thing.

75
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,551
Her name's Ann, Dad,
and he's not "going" on her, okay?

76
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,554
- They're just friends.
- <i>Not for long.</i>

77
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,647
They're making promises
to each other.

78
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,489
It's all that fidelity and pledging
yourself to a woman garbage.

79
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,063
<i>I wine 'em and dine 'em,</i>
<i>but I don't let 'em tell me what to do.</i>

80
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,999
I don't... let 'em tell me...
what to do.

81
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,639
<i>Okay, I should've never taken</i>
<i>the pumps out ofhere.</i>

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,574
<i>Listen, unlike you,</i>
<i>I respect my son's choices.</i>

83
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,306
<i>George Michael, I don't think you should</i>
<i>be going on this Promise Land thing.</i>

84
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,075
What? Why?
Because I'd miss school?

85
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,173
- No.
- You get to miss school for that?

86
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,550
<i>And that's when Maeby decided</i>
<i>to become a devout Christian.</i>

87
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,091
Do you guys know where I could get one of
those gold necklaces with the "T" on it?

88
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,160
- That's a cross.
- Across from where?

89
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,253
Um, it's not about school, pal.
It's more about family.

90
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,424
<i>Your Uncle Buster's been very depressed</i>
<i>lately, and you haven't visited him.</i>

91
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,994
<i>Family first. Or did they not teach you that</i>
<i>at the Promise Land?</i>

92
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,869
- I don't know. You won't let me go.
- Attaboy.

93
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,513
<i>Michael then went to the office,</i>
<i>where he ran into Gob.</i>

94
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,141
Barry come by yet?
I need to talk to him about my divorce.

95
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,742
<i>Gob had once</i>
<i>gotten married on a dare...</i>

96
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,721
<i>a fact he'd only remembered</i>
<i>when he was served with divorce papers.</i>

97
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,657
- That cow is going after me.
- Your wife? She was super-thin.

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,159
- She was?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,025
What about her cans?
She have big cans?

100
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,997
- You don't remember her at all?
- It was one night of wild passion.

101
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,627
- And yet you didn't notice her body.
- I like to look in the mirror.

102
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:42,470
That would be disgusting if you'd actually
slept with her, but I don't think you did.

103
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:46,409
- I did! And it <i>was</i> disgusting.
- <i>They didn't, but it would have been.</i>

104
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,174
Anyway, remember that seal of hers
that I released into the ocean?

105
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,182
- Bit off Buster's hand?
- Vaguely.

106
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,151
Her lawyers are claiming
that the seal's worth 250 grand.

107
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,153
And that's not even
including Buster's Swatch.

108
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:00,055
Listen, Gob, if you admit in court that
you never consummated the marriage...

109
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,354
you can get it annulled
and walk away free and clear.

110
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,159
You just can't deal with the fact that I've got
a super-thin wife with huge cans.

111
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,234
All right. Who's ready to show
their lawyer some love?

112
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,304
<i>The seal?</i>
<i>Must've had a tracking device on it.</i>

113
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,669
Someone tracked it all the way
to a dock in Dana Point.

114
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:19,211
You know, if that hand is still intact inside
the seal, Buster's got a shot at a transplant.

115
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,803
At the very least, we can get Buster's
Swatch back, right?

116
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,882
Up top. No?

117
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,551
<i>And Tobias met with</i>
<i>Carl Weathers at Burger King.</i>

118
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,178
<i>And Tobias met with</i>
<i>Carl Weathers at Burger King.</i>

119
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,083
Thanks for meeting me down here
at Burger King.

120
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,316
I'm tryin' to get them to underwrite
a new TV project I'm workin' on.

121
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,861
Get some money in exchange
for settin' a scene here in Burger King.

122
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,453
As long as you
don't draw attention to it.

123
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,431
I'm directing an episode
of the series <i>Scandal Makers.</i>

124
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,697
It's about the Bluth family and your
father-in-law's escape from justice.

125
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,864
- I play the lead- a bounty hunter, name of Ice.
- Oh, no.

126
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,033
You want me to play myself,
don't you?

127
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,043
I swore I'd not go reality.

128
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,876
- I will do-
- No, I already got a great guy
named Dave Attell to play you.

129
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,950
I wasn't actually here
to ask you to be in it.

130
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,143
I'm lookin' for somebody
in your family to sign a release.

131
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,214
I could not betray my family
like that.

132
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,622
Come on, man. I've got every part cast
except for George Sr.

133
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,890
- I want that part.
- Then sign over the rights.

134
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,056
I'm gonna go get a new soda.

135
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:18,263
Did you know that you can get a refill
on any drink you want here, and it's free?

136
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,896
It's a wonderful restaurant.

137
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,341
<i>It sure is. George Michael,</i>
<i>meanwhile, spent an afternoon...</i>

138
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,141
- <i>with his uncle, at his father's suggestion.</i>
- King me.

139
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,647
Oh, God! I keep forgetting about this.

140
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,743
- Oh, me too.
- Well, that's a do-over. So, who should go first?

141
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,754
I know.
Let's rock-paper-scissors for it.

142
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,950
- No! You would've-You would've won that, so-
- Oh.

143
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,257
George Michael- Buster, did you at least
offer your nephew a bowl of soup?

144
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,331
Yes, Mother, I did.

145
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,458
- Can I open a can of soup for you?
- Can it open a can?

146
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,163
- Can what open a can? Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

147
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,365
Actually, I just wanted to spend some time
with my Knuckle Buster.

148
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,741
- See, Mother? Not everybody is afraid of me.
- Oh, my God!

149
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:04,374
<i>Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending</i>
<i>some time with what's left of your uncle.</i>

150
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,545
I was supposed to go away to the Promise Land
this weekend, but my dad didn't want me to.

151
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,646
- Family first.
- Well, you've done your duty this week.

152
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,624
You're a very sympathetic
young man.

153
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,456
Very sympathetic.
You know what?

154
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,193
You deserve to go out of town this weekend,
and I'm taking you.

155
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,498
Really?
George Michael should have realized...

156
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,403
<i>by the sailor suit</i>
<i>Lucille dressed him in...</i>

157
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,306
<i>that he wasn't going north</i>
<i>to the Promise Land.</i>

158
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,312
I can't believe you don't know this song,
George Michael.

159
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,906
No, he was going south.

160
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,384
- <i>South to Motherboy.</i>

161
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,185
<i>And Michael and Gob headed out</i>
<i>to find the seal with the tracking device.</i>

162
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,891
I guess we should call Buster
and have him meet us at the dock, right?

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,366
I guess so.

164
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,263
Or we could make sure
it's the right seal first?

165
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,206
- I mean, why get his hopes up?
- Yeah, that's better.

166
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,277
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, God!

167
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,039
- Monster!
- Hey, Brothers.

168
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,841
- Buster.
- Bonster!

169
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,246
- Sorry about the window.
- Not a problem.

170
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,845
I really hate this stupid hook.
But I certainly can't walk around like this.

171
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,856
- Why not?
- Very handsome.

172
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,724
We were just gonna call you.
We think we know where the seal is.

173
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,796
- The seal that did this to me?
- Yeah.

174
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,058
- Take me!
- Yes. That's a good idea.

175
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,158
I'm gonna go with Barry.
You should get in here. I'll just go with Barry.

176
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,036
There's not enough room for you and me
and the stump and the thing- stuff. Barry!

177
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,110
<i>Tobias had gotten his first speaking role...</i>

178
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,078
<i>simply by signing away</i>
<i>the life rights of everyone he loved.</i>

179
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,708
- <i>And now he needed some research.</i>
- I'm George Sr.

180
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,946
Ooh, that's good.
That's the voice. I've got the voice.

181
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,421
- <i>That's not my voice.</i>
- Oh, my God!

182
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,425
- What are you doing here?
- I'm havin' a- tea party.

183
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:59,464
What does it look like? I live here.
You tell anybody, you are dead.

184
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,829
<i>Tobias saw the raw power of George Sr.</i>

185
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,200
Stop licking my hand,
you horse's ass.

186
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,900
<i>Apower he needed</i>
<i>the man to teach him.</i>
- That's it.

187
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,309
<i>So he explained the project,</i>
<i>and George Sr. Agreed on one condition.</i>

188
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,381
If you play me,
you gotta play me like a man...

189
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,009
and not some mincing little
Polly or Nellie.

190
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,078
I get those names confused.
Apologies. Apologies all around.

191
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,992
<i>And the search</i>
<i>for Buster's hand continued.</i>

192
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,426
I would love to be able
to say "Look what I've had reattached...

193
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,396
while you and George Michael
were off to Motherboy."

194
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,763
Motherboy? Wait a minute.

195
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,768
Mom took him to Motherboy?

196
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,534
He couldn't wait to swoop in and throw on that
sailor suit, because he's not damaged goods.

197
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,439
Wait a minute.
I don't want him doing that.

198
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,875
You gotta go with me down there
and help me get him, all right?

199
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,244
- That place is your scene.
- Face it, Michael. They've won.

200
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,249
He's the new Buster.

201
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,479
<i>This was the worst thing</i>
<i>Michael could possibly hear.</i>

202
00:10:55,588 --> 00:11:00,048
Oh, I'm so sorry. False alarm.
What they tracked down was a shark...

203
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,128
<i>and he must've bitten off the part of</i>
<i>the seal with the tracking device on it.</i>

204
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,029
- Left flipper.
- So, the seal lost his hand too.

205
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,624
Yeah, poor guy's probably out there
without a flipper...

206
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,330
<i>swimming around in a circle,</i>
<i>freaking out his whole family.</i>

207
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,067
That tracking device tells me
he was raised in captivity.

208
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,407
- <i>There's no way he stood a chance</i>
<i>out in the real world.</i>
- See that? He was a victim too.

209
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,040
<i>You both were too sheltered</i>
<i>to learn how to protect yourselves...</i>

210
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,050
and we can't let that happen
to George Michael.

211
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,883
I will help you, Michael.
We've got to rescue your son.

212
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,150
<i>And I've got to</i>
<i>staple this to a seal.</i>

213
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,317
<i>And I've skipped breakfast,</i>
<i>so I'm off to Burger King.</i>

214
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,630
<i>And Lucille arrived at</i>
<i>the hotel where Motherboy was taking place.</i>

215
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,363
This is nice, spending some time,
just the two of us.

216
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,202
Oh- me.
The exact same color.

217
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,208
What are the odds?

218
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,278
Not to worry.
Gangy brought some backups.

219
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,279
We'll get a room
so we can change.

220
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,282
You think enough time has passed
to do Sonny and Cher?

221
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,409
- <i>Who?</i>
- We're here for Motherboy.

222
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,919
And you do realize
this is not the band.

223
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,616
<i>Motherboy was also a heavy metal band...</i>

224
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,717
<i>That used to rock</i>
<i>pretty hard in the '70s.</i>

225
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,194
<i>We are legally obligated</i>
<i>to make the distinction.</i>

226
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,288
Maybe I should let
my dad know that we're here.

227
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,197
Oh, he'll know when we
bring home the trophy.

228
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,770
Yeah, but maybe
I'll just give him a call.

229
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,237
<i>And what name shall we</i>
<i>put the room under?</i>

230
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,310
- Karmopolis.
- <i>And Lindsay was about to see...</i>

231
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,869
<i>a Tobias with</i>
<i>the raw power of George Sr.</i>

232
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,881
I sort of want to talk
to you about some things.

233
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,316
It's a little late for talk, Lindsay.
I'm a man of action now.

234
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,884
You don't need the calories.

235
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,428
This isn't working.

236
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,730
Is it my imagination, or is he more
commanding and mannish?

237
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,999
It's like- I don't know.
Maybe I do want to be with him.

238
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,574
Then you should go to him.
For as it is written...

239
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:01,942
you shall be with whom you have formed
a more perfect union with under God.

240
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,242
She's right.

241
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,443
This isn't working.

242
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,611
I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong Motherboy.

243
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,621
This looks like the place.

244
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,816
<i>And Michael and Buster</i>
<i>arrived at Motherboy.</i>

245
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,951
Excuse me.
Has a Lucille Bluth checked in?

246
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,359
- I have no one by that name.
- God.

247
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,694
- She knows you're after her.
- She does?

248
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,428
Wait a minute.
I recognize those outfits.

249
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,936
- We're getting you out of here.
- Thank you! Thank you!

250
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,007
- Oh, God! It's red.
<i>- Take me with you! No, please! Please!</i>

251
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,076
- It's the wrong child.
- Where do we go next?

252
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,409
I will tell you this, Michael. If Mother saw
those two, she is going to change clothes.

253
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,414
And that means
he'll be on the balcony.

254
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,213
Whenever she changed clothes,
she made me wait on the balcony until zip-up.

255
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,550
And yet, anything goes at bath time.

256
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,284
Let's check the balconies.

257
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,952
<i>And Barry prepared Gob</i>
<i>to meet with his wife.</i>

258
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,188
If you really want
to settle this, your job...

259
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,231
is to convince
that "wife" of yours...

260
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,961
<i>that you are willing to go in front of thejudge</i>
<i>and admit that you never had sex.</i>

261
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,937
She has a name, Barry. You don't happen
to know what it is by the way, do you?

262
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,168
<i>That's why I want to settle.</i>
<i>I'm not super prepared.</i>

263
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,905
Well, we did have sex.
And I'm not a great liar.

264
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,038
<i>Both things hejust said were lies.</i>

265
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,050
- But if you think it'll scare her off.
- I do, and it will.

266
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,588
And you don't want to go in front of
that judge. I caught him in a drag club.

267
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,853
- What were you doin' there?
- Wow. You should be the lawyer.

268
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,265
<i>And soon, Michael and Buster</i>
<i>surveyed the hotel...</i>

269
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,267
<i>Iooking for George Michael.</i>

270
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,133
There's a very bored-looking little
Sonny Bono on that balcony.

271
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,867
<i>Oh, God. That means</i>
<i>she'll be dressed like Cher.</i>

272
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,672
I have an idea.

273
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:44,215
It is time I used something I trained for in army,
but I never got a chance to do.

274
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:48,013
- You cannot zip-line over there!
<i>- Either I zip down or he zips up!</i>

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,418
And that is a mighty long zipper
on Mother's Cher jumpsuit.

276
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,956
You have to get on
your knees to start it.

277
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,549
This is much less scary.
Godspeed, Buster.

278
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,764
One, two, three-

279
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,463
You came for me!

280
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,597
<i>Zip me up.</i>

281
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,108
We're switching rooms again.
And costumes.

282
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,956
<i>Tobias had begun work</i>
<i>on the set of</i> Scandal Makers.

283
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,619
<i>What's so great about Tobias is he's got this</i>
<i>obligation to his wife and daughter.</i>

284
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,288
- Whoa. This guy's straight?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,424
Then what the hell am I wearin' these for?
Look at that.

286
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,094
Hey, gang. I'm sorry.
I don't want to note you to death...

287
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,967
but you should be wearing those
under your pants.

288
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,804
- Why?
- It's a thing. There's dozens of us.

289
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,105
This whole thing is startin' to feel
like a real career killer.

290
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,112
- Yeah, I know, man.
- Also, l-

291
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,149
Tobias, why don't you go learn
your lines, man? Work on them.

292
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,583
Did I get lines? God!

293
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,621
They told me I was just jumping
onto a moving stair car.

294
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,748
If that man's straight,
then I am sober.

295
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,486
Hi. Um, I'm waiting
for "Gawb" Bluth.

296
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,789
I'm Gob Bluth.
My wife send you?

297
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,365
- I'm your wife.
- I knew that.

298
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,594
Nice to see you again, Usarmy.

299
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,434
You lost a lot of weight in Iraq,
especially up in the northern region.

300
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,668
- So where's the seal?
- Hey, that's not my problem.

301
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,267
As far as I'm concerned,
we were never even married.

302
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,314
Maybe I'll just say that
we never <i>sealed</i> the deal.

303
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,441
- You're willing to admit that?
- Lie about it? Yes.

304
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,453
<i>Wow. I mis-underestimated you.</i>

305
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:33,457
You've got some courage.
Makes me wonder what I'm missing.

306
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,527
You mean, other than your cans?

307
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,187
No. They're still here.

308
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,891
<i>And so Gob set about consummating...</i>

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,969
<i>the marriage he'd finally agreed</i>
<i>to claim he hadn't.</i>

310
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:51,532
<i>And back at Motherboy XXX, Lucille</i>
<i>was finding her new partner an asset.</i>

311
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,737
- Is this your son?
- No, I'm his grandmother.

312
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,838
- He's an orphan.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

313
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,350
- Well, you guys should win.
- I'm not an orphan. I have a dad.

314
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,750
Well, good luck to you.

315
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,822
Well, that little bit
of honesty helped nothing.

316
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,827
You'd better bring it
to the waltz, young man.

317
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,763
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and Buster</i>
<i>had retrieved Buster's hook...</i>

318
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,233
<i>and were staking out</i>
<i>the situation.</i>

319
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,328
<i>Gypsies.</i>

320
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,499
Hey.

321
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,840
They've changed into gypsies.
My army training...

322
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,382
tells me that this is
going to be a hot mission.

323
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,951
- One hot mission.
- Yes.

324
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,511
I create a diversion, and you grab
George Michael and go.

325
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,490
We need a name.

326
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,551
Maybe "Operation Hot Mother."

327
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,895
- No, let's try to top that.
- <i>They never did.</i>

328
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,095
<i>And later, Operation Hot Mother was underway.</i>

329
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,867
<i>Buster was waiting for Michael's cue</i>
<i>to unplug the lights.</i>

330
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,432
<i>But that's when Buster</i>
<i>caught his hook on a sandbag.</i>

331
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,378
Hey!

332
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,483
<i>And now from the land of gypsies,</i>
<i>Lucille Bluth and her orphaned grandson.</i>

333
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,485
What the hell's goin' on, Buster?
Cut the lights!

334
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,292
- Buster?
- Grab him! Take the gypsy boy!

335
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,127
- I'm taking you out of here. Let's go.
- They haven't served dinner yet.

336
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,962
- George Michael.
- You're not taking him.

337
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,935
- Take me with you!
- What are you doin'? I can't.

338
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,302
<i>Get off of me!</i>
<i>Buster, let's get out of here.</i>

339
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,899
I'm stuck. Go.
Take the boy. Go!

340
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,638
<i>All right, Motherboys.</i>
<i>Our curtain seems to be stuck.</i>

341
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,648
We're going to do some freestyle
waltzing while we get it fixed.

342
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,344
Boys' choice.

343
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,286
- <i>George Michael, you're choosing me.</i>
- No, Mom.

344
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,358
You had no right to bring him to this freak show.
He was supposed to be visiting Buster.

345
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,359
No, you were supposed
to be visiting Buster...

346
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,986
but you made your son do it
because you didn't want to.

347
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,088
- You were supposed to do it?
- You didn't want to?

348
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,932
No. Buster, l- I didn't know how
to, uh, treat you, all right?

349
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,972
I thought that you would be a little
different, but you're not.

350
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,474
I was wrong, okay?
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,603
You know, you're as good a brother
as you ever were.

352
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,808
- Thank you.
- All right?

353
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,182
Yes. I am no different.
I am the same old Motherboy.

354
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,518
George Michael still has a chance.
Take him!

355
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,217
Thanks. Let's go.

356
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,956
Boys' choice?

357
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:31,001
That is, if you're not embarrassed
to take my hook.

358
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,162
Of course not.

359
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,539
I'm Peter Pan,
and you're Captain Hook.

360
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,979
We'll pretend it's a costume.
Let's dance.

361
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,589
<i>And that night, Michael,</i>
<i>his brother and his son...</i>

362
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,090
- <i>arrived at the Promise Land.</i>
- All right.

363
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,320
I appreciate you taking me
up here to see Ann.

364
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,760
- A promise is a promise.
And I'm glad the three of us...
- Yeah.

365
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,492
- Were able to spend some time together.
- Oh, yeah.

366
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,061
- And I finally feel good about myself. "Saddest."
- <i>And I saw some of those people.</i>

367
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,039
- That was a very competitive category.
- Oh, don't I know it.

368
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,042
- Here we go.
- I can't get out, actually.

369
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,908
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

370
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:19,177
<i>Lindsay finds herself strangely compelled</i>
<i>to be with Tobias.</i>

371
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,014
I have never
been more attracted to you.

372
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,054
Wow. The service
sent you over fast.

373
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,784
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm in the wrong trailer.

374
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,792
<i>But not the one she's married to.</i>

375
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,886
So you don't cry
when you take those off?

376
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,160
<i>Having finally had sex, Gob can admit...</i>

377
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,462
<i>he never consummated</i>
<i>their marriage.</i>

378
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:42,700
Judge, maybe you should take a look at this.
It was taken in your office just moments ago.

379
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,902
- <i>But Gob catches a lucky break.</i>
- There's no way to tell who this man is.

380
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,036
<i>But it doesn't last long.</i>

381
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,546
That's me, Your Honor.
L- my wife.

382
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,982
<i>We really lost this case.</i>

383

385
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,222
Knock, scrape.
The only thing more terrifying...

386
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,593
<i>than the escaped lunatic's hook</i>
<i>was his twisted call!</i>

387
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,599
Hey, campers.

388
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,731
I'm a monster!

389
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,810
This may have been
a step backwards.

<i>Upon her knee</i>

391
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,827

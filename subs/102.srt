Quick question though.

Am I panicked about the fire,

Or, even better,
could you mail this letter for me?

237
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:19,088
You can't just give that
to a mailman?

238
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:22,687
I can't trust a mailman with this.
This is important.

<i>[Narrator] Gob was intrigued.</i>

You are not going to keep

That's why you wanted me
to give T-Bone a job?

- To pay him back
for burning down the storage unit?
- Michael, that's ridiculous.

Well, I'm not hiring him. No.
We don't have the money, Pop.

all summer with you pulling the strings.

What was I gonna do, put a kid in charge

Sure. That's what I did.
I just made my son the manager.

00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,798
This is just like when we were kids,
and you were the only one...

318
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,928
- he let work in the banana stand.
- Well, I got news for you.

319
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,201
Dad still doesn't trust me to this day.
He treats me like a low-level employee.

320
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:02,402
[Scoffs] Better than being treated
like the goofball...

321
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,207
the joker, the magician.

322
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,616
I thought you were gonna do,
like, a trick there.

323
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,618
- A fireball or something.
- I was. It didn't go off.

324
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,620
- These things never go off when you want them to.
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

325
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:16,054
- My least consistent trick.
- Hang on one sec. Hello.

326
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:19,150
- Hey, Uncle Michael, it's me, Maeby.
- Where's George Michael?

327
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:23,891
At the banana stand. He's about to do
something really irresponsible.

328
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,763
<i>You</i> think it's irresponsible?
I'll be right there.

329
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,535
- I'm gonna get blamed for this.
- <i>[Michael] George Michael.</i>

330
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,665
- Dad.
- Hey, what are you doing?

331
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:38,406
I was just, uh...
I was burning down the banana stand.

332
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:41,244
- What?
- I'm sorry. I screwed it all up.

333
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,250
I've got no right to
call myself Mr. Manager.

334
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:45,183
- Manager.
- Manager. I'm sorry, Dad.

335
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:48,347
- Oh, George Michael.
- I am. But I'll make it up to you.

336
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,186
I'll work weeknights.
I'll lay people off.

337
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,089
I'll give up my summer,
all my summers.

338
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,162
just just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

339
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:58,757
<i>[Narrator] Michael realized he had done</i>
<i>to his son what his father had done to him...</i>

340
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,267
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

341
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,305
- Burn it down.
- What?

342
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,239
Let's burn this son of a bitch.

343
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,277
This is gonna be
our best summer ever, buddy.

344
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,152
<i>[Narrator] And so, Michael, his son</i>
<i>and his brother together enjoyed...</i>

345
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:30,561
<i>the cathartic burning</i>
<i>of the banana stand.</i>

346
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,863
You mailed that
insurance check, right, Gob?

349
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:51,114
<i>[Narrator] The next morning,</i>
<i>Lindsay woke up late in the day...</i>

350
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,415
<i>hungover from celebrating</i>
<i>her one day of employment...</i>

351
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:56,184
<i>which, it turns out,</i>
<i>she had slept through.</i>

352
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,885
[Roger] All right, Lindsay, forget it.
We'll get someone else.

353
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:01,155
- <i>[Narrator] Tobias was next on the call list</i>...
- <i>[Ringing]</i>

354
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,163
- <i>but, unfortunately, couldn't hear the phone</i>...
- <i>[Sobbing]</i>

355

- <i>over the sound of the shower.</i>
- <i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

356
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,698
<i>He did, however,</i>
<i>use Lindsay's conditioner...</i>

357
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:12,069
- and was surprised to find that
it did help his self-esteem.
- Mornin'.

358
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:14,699
- You look nice.
- What?

359
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,710
You look
very handsome today.

360
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,677
Thank you, Lindsay.

361
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,580
<i>[Narrator] And Michael finally got to show</i>
<i>his father who's boss.</i>

362
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:26,450
- You what?
- Burned it right down to the ground.

363
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:30,013
Are you crazy?
There was money in that banana stand.

364
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,094
Well, it's all gone now, Dad,
and it was my decision.

365
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,254
So the next time you wanna have
a little power struggle...

366
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,696
just remember that
you're playing with fire.

367
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,203
There was $250,000 lining the walls
of the banana stand.

368
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:45,467
- What?
- Cash, Michael.

369
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:48,372
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- How much clearer can I say...

370
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:52,413
[Shouting] "There's always money
in the banana stand"?

371
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,414
- No touching! No touching!
- No touching!

372
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,882
- No touching! No touching!

378
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:15,228
You couldn't have called me?
I can't swing a hammer?

379
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:20,402
- I got a rabbit to buy.

...tell them
how you were drowning

84

to save you.

85
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:28,171
Tell them what I did.

86
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,133
- The truth.
- Okay.

87
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:33,969
She stole the "Queen Mary"
to get away from the SEC.

88

Oh, and she winked.

00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,308

- Oh, God.

91

- Hey!
- What are you doing?

92
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:42,644
Wait, wh-where you going?

93
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:44,020
Wait, she doesn't
have her make--

94
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:45,396
I have her lipstick!

95
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,149
<i>But Buster knew that lipstick</i>

99
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,536
This is the same scene
I came back to

100
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:03,332
after Cancun four years ago.

101
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:07,418
<i>And after devising their plan</i>
<i>to build the wall,</i>

102
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,546
<i>it was decided that</i>
<i>George Sr. should move out,</i>

103

<i>in order to make</i>
<i>their fake divorce look real.</i>

104
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,593
After the trial,
you can move back in.

105
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,263
It's only a trial separation.

106
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,556
(laughs):
I made a pun.

107
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,557
(chuckles)

108
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,768
Even in this time of stress.

109
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,229
You think you're gonna be okay,
alone with Buster?

110
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,481
If I need a moment to myself,
I'll step out on the balcony.

111
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:30,192
Your ankle bracelet--
it's gonna go off.

112
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:31,985
So I'll make him
stand on the balcony.

113
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:33,987
He's happiest
when he feels useful.

114

125
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,891
<i>But as her trial grew closer,</i>

126
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:06,395
<i>for Lucille</i>

127
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,147
This toast has hook holes...

128
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,317
...again! I told you to get rid
of that thing; it's hideous.

129
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,819
Plus, what's gonna happen
when they swear you in?

130
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,905
You're gonna
rip the Bible in half.

131
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,240
The jury will love that.

132
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,534
You're getting pretty snippy

133
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,203
to your key witness, aren't you?

134
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,704
What do you want?

135
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:28,417
Maybe you could hook me up
with a little stimmy.

136
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,503
Lil' stimmy.

137
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:33,629
Are you trying to do this?

138
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,215
Yes!

139
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,259
And I want stimmy
to get a hook that'll do that.

140
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,052
<i>When no such hook</i>
<i>was available,</i>

141
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:42,764
<i>Lucille found other means</i>
<i>to mollify her alibi--</i>

142
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:45,225
<i>both of which were unveiled</i>
<i>at a family meeting.</i>

143
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,353
...you're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

144
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,063
Wait, I thought
I was the key witness.

145
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:51,689
- You're the star witness.
- Oh.

146
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,567
Because it was your life
I was going after to save.

147
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,069
He fell off the boat.

148
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,071
- He'll tell you in my own words.
- (groans)

149
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,572
(mumbles):
Homosexuals kidnapped...

150
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:02,033
Up-up-up.

151
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,119
(loudly):
Homosexuals kidnapped the boat

152
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,912
and took it on a joy ride.

153
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,747
Mother didn't want to trample
their rights, so she let them.

154
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,332
Then she realized
that her son fell

155
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:11,709
off the boat and into the water,
and she went back.

156
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,586
Oh, and a fish swam by my ankle.

157
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,297
(gasps)
That really happened.

158
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,465
Should I keep that?

159
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,840
- Make it an eel.
- Okay.

160
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:19,801

- Better.

161

Buster, I'm going to exhale!

164

No, please!

165
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:32,688
I've had, like, seven
in the past half hour.

166
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,317
You're not the one
staring five years in the face.

167
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,278
Well, right now, I'm staring at
a hundred years in the face!

168
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,113
(whispers):
How dare you.

169
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:43,492
Would you mind?

170
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,701
Be careful, defendant.

171
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:48,579
Remember who you're talking to.

00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,832
It sure would be a shame
if something happened

173
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,251
to your pretty little
key witness.

174
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,420
Star witness.

175
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:57,588
And are you
threatening yourself?

176
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,132
Maybe I am.

177
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:03,345
<i>And losing confidence</i>
<i>in her star witness,</i>

178
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:05,596
<i>Lucille decided to take</i>
<i>a few keepsakes with her,</i>

179
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:09,476
<i>in case things didn't</i>
<i>go her way.</i>

180
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,270
<i>And that's when she discovered</i>

181
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,605
<i>that the family</i>
<i>she believed supported her</i>

182
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,484
<i>had actually already begun</i>
<i>divvying up her stuff,</i>

183
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,693
<i>in case she lost.</i>

184
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,280
Aw...

185
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,574
And he's supposed to be
the good one.

186
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:27,494
This does not bode well
for tomorrow.

187
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:30,246
<i>Actually, they'd claimed</i>
<i>those things years earlier</i>

188
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,041
<i>when she was having</i>
<i>a sunspot checked.</i>

189
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:34,543
<i>But she was right</i>
<i>to worry about</i>

190
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,169
<i>the turnout for the trial.</i>

191
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:39,088
Does the defense have a witness
they'd like to call?!

192
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,673
Any witness?

193
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,758
Please tell me you're working on
a strategy for us.

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,927
Oh. It's us now?

195
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,263
Well, we have Lucille Austero.

196
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:48,639
She's the only one who showed.

197
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,683
I don't think
that is good for us.

198
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:51,851
Nonsense.

199
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,353
- She owns the company now.
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,480
She's got as much to lose
as I do.

201
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,232
And she's a dear friend.

202
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:58,816
I'll do it myself though.

203
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:00,402
I need this to go well.

204
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:03,530
<i>And so it was Lucille</i>
<i>who did the questioning</i>

205
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,241
<i>of her new star witness,</i>
<i>Lucille 2.</i>

206
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:08,701
Thank you so much
for coming to be my witness.

207
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,953
You're such
a large shareholder...

208
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,539
Oh...

209
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:14,290
(chuckles):
I've made a pun.

210
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:17,502
Oh, how could I not do it
for my oldest friend?

211
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:18,711
Oh!

212
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:20,922
Now I've gone and done a double.

213
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,215
(laughs):
A double.

214
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:23,925
Like your pre-surgery chin.

215
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,510
Or your post-breakfast drink.

216
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:28,679
Oh, I wish you'd come
to my rehab clinic.

217
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,807
But anything to help that
Keystone Cop family of yours.

218
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,268
Keystone Cops.

219
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,604
Your references are as fresh
as the wallpaper

220
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,480
in the room
of that pretend child

221
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:39,357
you've had all these years.

222
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,443
- But, my friend...
- You're right, I shouldn't joke.

223
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:44,153
None of your family showed up,
you poor thing.

224
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:46,739
This is such a black mark
on all of you.

225
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,658
You should know
about black marks.

226
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,952
Your pillow must look like
a Rorschach test.

227
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:53,580
(chuckles): Not that there'd be
anyone to see it.

228
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:55,373
So, as I was saying...

229
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:56,832
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

230
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:59,252
<i>their 30-year</i>
<i>passive-aggressive dance</i>

231
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:01,003
<i>was losing some of its passive.</i>

232
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,047
As if everybody in this room
couldn't tell

233
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,801
how jealous and conniving you
are, my dear Lucille Austero.

234
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:10,597
What I knew was that you were
stealing for years-- we all did!

235
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,433
That's why nobody was surprised
when you stole that boat.

236
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:14,892
And I knew you couldn't wait

237
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,479
to get your liver-spotted claws
into my company!

238
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,730
Says the woman whose liver
can be spotted from outer space.

239
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,024
- No further questions!
- No further answers!

240
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,401
Am I done?

241
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:27,322
Oh, that's got to be
a treasure chest.

242
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:28,490
You think that went well?

243
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,575
BARRY:
I do.

244
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:33,495
<i>The judge kept Lucille on ice</i>
<i>while she awaited the verdict.</i>

245
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,246
Have you heard anything?

246
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:38,916
Well, our cashier's pregnant,
and she's not married, so...

247
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,209
I mean about me.

248
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,295
Oh, you're guilty--
three to five.

249
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,723
<i>Lucille was</i>
<i>checking in to her new home.</i>

250
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:56,851
Hello! Oh, Mrs. Bluth is here,
for stealing the "Queen Mary."

251
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:59,854
- We're so glad to have you here.
<i>- It was one of the so-called</i>

252
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:00,813
<i>country club prisons...</i>

253
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:03,024
So... you are here.

254
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:05,776
<i>...that had become popular</i>
<i>after the Enron debacle.</i>

255
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,195
...so you're gonna take
this hallway to the elevators,

256
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,488
and then you're gonna
want to go...

257
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,989
Slow down.

258
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:11,949
You sound like the end
of a Cymbalta commercial.

259
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,160
Even the lifers get confused.
Don't worry...

260
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,954
<i>Even though it was a nice</i>
<i>prison, it was still prison.</i>

261
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:18,331
...your choice of
fresh scent, sport,

262
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,957
or floral for your delousing.

263
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,502
Also, if you're
sexually assaulted by a guard...

264
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:25,171
A $20 gratuity is appreciated?

265
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,422
(laughs)

266
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,799
No, but press seven
on your phone.

267
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,553
If you go through the front
desk, it'll take forever.

268
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,764
<i>After Lucille got settled in,</i>
<i>she received a visitor.</i>

269
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,057
LUCILLE:
You missed my trial, George.

270
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,266
How could you?

271
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,976
GEORGE SR:
I told you I was sorry.

272
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:40,770
I was unconscious
on the sweat lodge floor.

273
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:41,812
I lost two days.

274
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,398
I'm losing three to five years.

275
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,692
And those are the last years,
George, the best years,

276
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:48,027
where you can have sex and not
worry about getting pregnant.

277
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:49,362
All right, here's the good news:

278
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:51,030
they only got you
on stealing the boat.

279
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:53,074
They didn't even touch us
on the financial stuff.

280
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,159
- You're gonna get out of here.
- When?

281
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,537
Better be before the money runs
out; this place isn't cheap.

282
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,665
I know, and you are
running up those spa bills.

283
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:03,793
The same girl who hands me
towels does the cavity checks.

284
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,253
You tip.

285
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,589
Barry says he can get your
sentence reduced if...

286
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,050
you agree to leave here
and go to Lucille 2's

287
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:12,552
rehab clinic.

288
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:15,304
That's the bitch
that put me here.

289
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,391
And I'm not gonna fake having
some sort of...

290
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,017
I don't know-- alcohol problem--

291
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,604
just so that sterile cuckoo bird
can laugh at me.

292
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:24,188
I figured. Okay.

293
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,941
I have another idea--
now, you know China Garden?

294
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:28,234
I know the one by the harbor.

295
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:29,277
No, this one's a person.

296
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,486
And that one closed.

297
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,947
China Garden's Aunt Olive

298
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:35,491
is very well connected
with the Jade Triad Gang.

299
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,743
It's a prison gang here.

300
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:38,661
And believe me,
they will protect you.

301
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,747
That's a gang?

302
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:43,833
I thought they were
tech support.

303
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,585
<i>It turned out</i>
<i>they were a gang.</i>

304
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,796
<i>And thanks to China Garden,</i>

305
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:50,047
<i>Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a probationary member.</i>

306
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,674
You play mahjong before?

307
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:53,884
Our beach club used
to have a Jewish Day.

308
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:54,969
Your move, Olive Garden.

309
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,596
I can't concentrate.

310
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,973
Playing mahjong
without cigarette is like

311
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:01,058
playing video poker without...

312
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,101
cigarette.

313
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,019
Why are we not allowed to smoke

314
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,605
in this stupid prison?

315
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:08,524
<i>And that's</i>
<i>when Lucille made her move.</i>

316
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:11,444
- I know a loophole.
- Huh?

317
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:12,654
"Roop hore"?

318
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,489
- Roop hore.
- Roop hore.

319
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,658
<i>It was a loophole</i>
<i>that would get Lucille</i>

320
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,034
<i>accepted as</i>
<i>a full-fledged member</i>

321
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,704
<i>member of</i>
<i>the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

322
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,456
You couldn't have chosen
a harder word to say.

323
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,419
<i>And soon</i>
<i>the Dragons were taking</i>

324
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,505
<i>"drags on"</i>
<i>their cigarettes again.</i>

325
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:32,590
There's always a way
to get what you want.

326
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:36,678
My husband is a very
powerful man, Lucille Bluth.

327
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:39,764
Perhaps we can help each other
get what we want.

328
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,184
<i>And that's how Lucille found</i>
<i>a deep-pocketed investor</i>

329
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:44,935
<i>to help build the wall.</i>

330
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:48,606
I got Olive Garden
to offer us unlimited bread.

331
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:51,651
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

332
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:54,612
So the Chinese will own
a piece of the wall

333
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:55,988
between U.S. and Mexico?

334
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,740
They'll own all of it,
but they'll make us

335
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,784
very rich in the process.

336
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,411
We just need to get Michael
to sign a release.

337
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,330
He sold his shares,
but he could still claim

338
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:05,623
that he deserves a piece.

339
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,250
Or worse, find out
and blow the whistle.

340
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,211
Where the hell did we go wrong
with that kid?

341
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,963
Probably where we went wrong
with the others-- I don't know.

342
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,884
I like the plan... I just wonder

343
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,386
if we're not in that
treason-adjacent place

344
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,847
where the, uh,
government will retaliate

345
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,765
and, uh... execute us.

346
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:25,643
LUCILLE: Oh, they'd never
execute a woman for this.

347
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,479
I have a good feeling
about these people.

348
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,398
Oh, that's good enough for me.

349
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,107
- (George crying)
<i>- But the change in the economy</i>

350
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,570
<i>led the government to put</i>
<i>the wall project on hold.</i>

351
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:36,946
<i>And as the months passed</i>

352
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:39,448
<i>and the Chinese saw</i>
<i>no progress on the wall,</i>

353
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,867
<i>tension mounted.</i>

354
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:43,703
<i>And Lucille was getting</i>
<i>more controlling.</i>

355
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:44,871
She said you're fat.

356
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,622
That's what you said, right?

357
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:47,916
Or does that mean something

358
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,668
- different in Chinese?
- No, it means "fat."

359
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,420
You keep causing trouble,
you're going to end up

360
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,964
- with noodles in your belly.
- I like noodles.

361
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:57,884
Not this way--
very hard to digest.

362
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,552
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

363
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:01,387
It's no secret--
we'll kill you.

364
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,472
<i>- She was even being controlling</i>
- Did you get that?

365
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,725
<i>of the"R.A.P.H.O.C.W.C.P.S."</i>

366
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,435
<i>reality TV crew.</i>

367
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,186
Do you need a clean of
her making the threat?

368
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,772
I can lean back,
but you will come around

369
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,398
and get my reaction, yes?

370
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,817
Oh, I'll say it again--
we'll kill you.

371
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,152
<i>But soon</i>
<i>the threat was made real.</i>

372
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:19,781
Oh!
She's got a sharpened noodle!

373
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:21,616
She's trying to noodle-stab me!

374
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:23,117
- Back up!
- (people screaming)

375
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:24,243
(yells)

376
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,496
- (grunts)
- (people yelling)

377
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:28,748
(blows)

378
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,625
Aah, my eye!

379
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,085
This will be even more
exciting if you jump cut it.

380
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:34,796
Quiet!

381
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:39,258
You can't just come in and have
bread for nothing around here.

382
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,886
You have to pay bill some time.

383
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:44,722
<i>It wasn't a great time to find</i>
<i>out George didn't own</i>

384
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,725
<i>the right property</i>
<i>to build the wall on.</i>

385
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,519
<i>- And so a new plan emerged</i>
- LUCILLE: Make sure Hebert Love

386
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,229
comes out against the wall...

387
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:55,817
<i>They needed the government</i>
<i>to kill the wall completely,</i>

388
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:57,610
<i>- but pay them anyway.</i>
- As much as I'd like to stay

389
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:58,778
and lay some more pipe with you,

390
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,571
I better get moving
on this thing.

391
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,364
We've got to make
this wall work, George.

392
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:04,033
We know Lucille 2
will oppose it,

393
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:06,410
we just have make sure
Herbert Love does.

394
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:08,244
Oh, don't worry-- that's
why I asked Michael for help.

395
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,707
Michael? What are you bringing
Michael into this for?

396
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,751
The only thing he should
be doing is signing over

397
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:14,877
his rights to the company.

398
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,420
I asked him to do this as well.

399
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,630
<i>He made it a condition</i>
<i>of the now</i>

400
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:19,590
<i>four favor family pact.</i>

401
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:20,842
Will you please relax?

402
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:21,801
...do something for me?

403
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,678
You know,
your mother is very hurt.

404
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,805
You haven't visited her.
It's like you have given up

405
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,389
- on the family business.
- I have.

406
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,183
Yes, but not in writing.

407
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:30,977
To protect all of us, visit her,

408
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,270
sign a little something
saying it's all hers.

409
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:34,605
- Will you do this, Michael?
- Yeah.

410
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:35,690
But I get to make you look bad

411
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:36,983
- in the movie, okay?
- Okay.

412
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,067
- Should we settle up?
- All right.

413
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,610
Who owes what-what to who?

414
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:40,987
LUCILLE: <i>Send me some evidence</i>
<i>of a wall</i>

415
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,530
<i>I can show the Chinese.</i>

416
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,698
And the government.

417
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,034
We need to make
this happen, George.

418
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,077
The Chinese have more
than a sharpened noodle

419
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:49,745
with my name on it.

420
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,831
NARRATOR: <i>And days later,</i>
<i>that evidence arrived</i>

421
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,248
<i>from George Sr.</i>

422
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,792
We've built this wall.

423
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,544
We have miles and...

424
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:59,714
and miles of wall, uh...

425
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:06,012
(audio fast-fowarding)

426
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:08,514
- There's more wall, uh...
- Dad! Dad...!

427
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:11,225
- And you know, and it feels good
to help, -It's spinning!

428
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:12,935
to protecting our-our border.

429
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,812
LUCILLE: My God,
he Steamboat Willied it.

430
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:16,898
- It's a heart project.
- Dad! Dad!

431
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,315
We love America.

432
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,943
- We love America.
- Daddy!

433
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:23,988
(sighs)

434
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,616
<i>And that's when Lucille noticed</i>
<i>something worrisome.</i>

435
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:32,246
<i>It seemed her prison family</i>
<i>was preparing</i>

436
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,917
<i>for her to disappear as well.</i>

437
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,800
<i>So Lucille took matters</i>
<i>into her own hands.</i>

438
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,055
GOB: Well, that was fast,
you hot little...

439
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:51,557
- It's your mother. -Hi, sorry, I
thought you were somebody else.

440
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,225
I can't tell you who, 'cause
I'm-I'm dating someone famous.

441
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,685
someone... famous.

442
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,687
You better start to build
this wall built pronto.

443
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:59,148
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

444
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:01,067
Well, I'm kind of busy now--
I'm working with Michael.

445
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:03,111
What are you working on
with Michael?

446
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,779
Dad made him give me a job.

447
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,196
I see--
so he thought it was

448
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,532
a good idea
to have you two together.

449
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,034
Isn't that nice?

450
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,578
My God, is there anyone there
with half a brain

451
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,829
that can help me with this?

452
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,123
I don't know about
"half a brain,"

453
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,665
but Tobias is living
with me right now

454
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,292
and he's not very bright.

455
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,378
Although he is working in
the rehab where Lucille 2 is.

456
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,797
He is?

457
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,339
<i>And that's</i>
<i>when Lucille came up</i>

458
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,008
<i>with a plan</i>
<i>to get transferred away</i>

459
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,468
<i>from the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

460
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,053
Hire a crew and start the wall.

461
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,554
And not a word to your brother.

462
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,056
I'm getting a transfer.

463
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:34,809
It's time for Mama to put on
the old drunk act.

464
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,518
GOB:
That was an a...?

465
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:41,190
<i>After a call</i>
<i>to Lucille 2's rehab center,</i>

466
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,942
- (slurring): Lucille 2, please.
<i>- where her drunk act was</i>

467
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:45,486
<i>as good as you'd see</i>
<i>at the Method One Clinic...</i>

468
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,155
Fine, Lucille Austero.

469
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,115
<i>...Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a patient.</i>

470
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:50,449
<i>And soon met the therapist</i>

471
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,241
<i>who held the keys to her</i>
<i>freedom.</i>

472
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,409
You look great.

473
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,120
That suit looks
very hetero on you.

474
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:56,998
Well, thank you--
you look very hetero as well.

475
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,334
Now... how are you?

476
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,961
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.

477
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,213
So write that down on a form,
sign me out,

478
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,548
I won't have
to go back to prison,

479
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,385
and maybe you'll find a new car
parked in your driveway.

480
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:13,764
Oh...

481
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,975
Yes, well,
it-it doesn't work that way.

482
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:18,811
We have to have a series
of sessions, and, uh, I have to

483
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,313
swear in the best
of my professional opinion

484
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,691
that you have accepted
and made every effort

485
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:26,443
at thoughtfully reflecting
upon your weaknesses.

486
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,487
Yes!
Write down that I did that.

487
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,156
Well, no,
I-I don't work that way.

488
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:31,532
You don't work any way.

489
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:33,325
This is your first paying job
in ten years.

490
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:34,702
Oh, no, no, this doesn't pay.

491
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,537
This is part of a
work release program.

492
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:38,706
The state of California thinks
that I'm a sex offender.

493
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:41,416
D-D-Don't worry about what
the state of California thinks.

494
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,127
The point is we have a chance

495
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,753
to be honest with ourselves.

496
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,673
Fine-- you don't look
heterosexual in that suit.

497
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,051
You look as swishy
as Ryan Seacrest.

498
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:51,886
Ryan Seacrest is straight.

499
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,013
And I'm 40!
Sign the form.

500
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,182
Well, at least we have
a dialogue going.

501
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,683
Dialogue?

502
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,727
If you don't release me
you've heard the last

503
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:01,687
I'm going to say to you
in these sessions.

504
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:03,605
Fine, but you will have
to sit with me

505
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,274
for the full session.

506
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:07,818
Every single session.

507
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,156
Now, Lucille, I can't
make you talk.

508
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,658
But you know what I can do?

509
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:22,208
Hmm?

510
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,462
Okay, I can't trick you
into talking, either.

511
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,798
<i>This went on</i>
<i>for several sessions.</i>

512
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:39,683
Perhaps that's
why they call this place

513
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,853
Au-stare-ity.

514
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,315
No?

515
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:51,028
Au-stare-i...

516
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,154
Fine.

517
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:53,197
Well, if you're
not going to talk,

518
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,448
I'm just going to...

519
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,366
- write this up.
<i>- Earlier that day,</i>

520
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,410
<i>Tobias had encountered</i>
<i>a plot problem</i>

521
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,288
<i>with the</i>
<i>"Fantastic Four"musical.</i>

522
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,496
A villain.

523
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,124
I was thinking the same thing.

524
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,876
I mean, why aren't the
Fantastic Four fighting anyone.

525
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:07,586
Instead of just
dancing around, you mean.

526
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:09,755
Right, it's like all Sharks
and no Jets.

527
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:11,799
Then we would have a second act.

528
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,467
Lucia, right?

529
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:14,969
I mean, that's their foe.

530
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,345
Lucia Von Bardass?

531
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,557
Have you guys ever
even read one of these things?

532
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,977
<i>So Tobias was glad for the</i>
<i>break in Lucille's sessions.</i>

533
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,019
- ...to do this right?
<i>- So that he could work on it.</i>

534
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,520
I mean, really right.

535
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:27,940
This woman is a villain.

536
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,317
You think I'm a villain, too?

537
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,609
- No...
- My children

538
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:32,153
are all waiting for me to die

539
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,654
so they can divvy up my stuff,

540
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,614
my Chinese gang mates were
getting ready

541
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:38,284
to noodle stab me,
and even one of the guards

542
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:40,328
called me "Gangie,"
and he was talking

543
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,703
about the monster movie.

544
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:44,165
He thinks that horrible
monster looks like me!

545
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:46,667
So fine, you want to call me
a villain, I accept it!

546
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,960
I'm your villain!

547
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:50,171
Uh, actually I was writing down

548
00:20:50,212 --> 00:20:51,213
a casting breakdown

549
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,007
for the role of Lucia

550
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:54,800
for my "Fantastic Four" musical.

551
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:57,761
This was all
about your stupid play?

552
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:59,388
I was about to cry

553
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,556
for the first time in 60 years.

554
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:04,101
I remember when
the last time was, too.

555
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:07,062
I hid under Mama's porch
during a thunderstorm...

556
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:09,273
(voice breaks): and I found
the remains of my ostri...

557
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,775
It's not a stupid play.

558
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,319
It's a musical.

559
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,653
And I have to debut it

560
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,238
on a boat at Cinco.

561
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:18,782
It's on a boat?

562
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,326
Take to the sea!

563
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,786
Yes, I'll sign everyone out
for the night,

564
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:26,123
but I guess I'll have to play
the old sea bitch myself.

565
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,749
I'm in.

566
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,459
Really?

567
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,045
Well, that's wonderful.

568
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:33,047
Well, I think we have made
a breakthrough today.

569
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,174
In the musical, not you.

570
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,926
Oh, God, no, there's miles
of work to do with you. (laughs)

571
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:40,512
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>he would make her audition.</i>

572
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:42,597
<i>So Lucille wrote a song</i>
<i>from the heart.</i>

573
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,266
LUCILLE:

574
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:45,893

575
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,477

Terrifying.

585
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,454
Isn't she?

586
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:06,705
Betty, you can leave.

587
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:08,540
Lucille, would you please stay?

588
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:11,419
<i>But staying was the last thing</i>
<i>Lucille had in mind.</i>

589
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,878
- (phone rings)
- LUCILLE: Hello?

590
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,880
MAN: I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

591
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:15,839
George, is that you?

592
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,383
<i>It wasn't.</i>

593
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,968
<i>It was Oscar who,</i>
<i>living as George,</i>

594
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,096
<i>- and feeling more amorous...</i>
- (Oscar whistles)

595
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:25,474
<i>...went to visit Lucille 2</i>
<i>for an afternoon delight.</i>

596
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:27,726
<i>When she wasn't there,</i>
<i>he found her work number.</i>

597
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:28,810
WOMAN:
Austerity.

598
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,229
Lucille 2, please?

599
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:32,231
<i>But, of course, at Austerity,</i>

600
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:34,649
<i>- this woman is Lucille 2.</i>
- Hello.

601
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,651
I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

602
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,237
LUCILLE:
George, is that you?

603
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,489
<i>But a newly virile Oscar</i>
<i>figured, in a pinch,</i>

604
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,366
<i>any Lucille would do.</i>

605
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,826
Yes, this is George.
Where are you?

606
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,412
I'm in rehab, you know that.

607
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:49,039
Why don't I swing by,
and we can conjugate?

608
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:50,665
Let's do our business
over the phone.

609
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:53,627
May not have a lot of time,
but, uh, all right, here goes:

610
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:56,838
I want to pull your panties
off with my...

611
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,340
Real business, George.

612
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:01,551
I'd very much like to pull your
underwear off with my teeth...

613
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:02,970
LUCILLE:
No-- at Cinco,

614
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:05,431
we're getting on a boat,
we're leaving the country.

615
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:06,932
OSCAR:
But what about love?

616
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:10,102
Easy-- Gene Parmesan
got photos of Herbert Love

617
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:11,312
with some redheaded whore.

618
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:14,773
I'm giving his wife a taste,
so he knows we know.

619
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,068
If he wins, we should be able to
get him to do whatever we want

620
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,694
with that wall now.

621
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:20,737
- (phone beeps)
- I'm not completely following...

622
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,323
Oop. Hold on.

623
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:24,283
<i>And that's when Lucille finally</i>
<i>had a visit from her son.</i>

624
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:26,327
- Hello.
- Michael Bluth here to see you.

625
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,869
Send him up.

626
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,997
- OSCAR: ...with my teeth.
- Michael's here.

627
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:31,499
- Oh...
- This is my chance to make sure

628
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,167
he doesn't get
too cozy with Gob.

629
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,294
- Why?
- Bad things happen

630
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,004
when brothers collude.

631
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,051
When can we have sex?

632
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:44,303
LUCILLE:
After Cinco.

633
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:46,054
Cinco?

634
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:48,682
LUCILLE: Just get a boat ready,
we'll make our getaway.

635
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,600
So not... not today.

636
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:54,146
<i>And that's when she saw Michael</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

637
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,524
<i>since the last time</i>
<i>he left the family.</i>

638
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:57,899
Wow.

639
00:23:57,941 --> 00:23:59,360
This is a step up from prison.

640
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,944
How would you know?

641
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,530
You haven't come
to visit me once.

642
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,531
Yeah. Sorry.

643
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:04,948
I feel bad about that.

644
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,616
So you're here to make amends?

645
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,203
Because you know your mother
will always take you back.

646
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:11,788
And because
I know my mother wants me

647
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,082
to sign away any connection
to the family business.

648
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:15,083
I just need a signature.

649
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,668
I'm happy to help.
If...

650
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,004
- you do something for me.
- For me.

651
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:21,340
Yeah, I heard
that's been happening.

652
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:23,592
I'm happy to help you, honey.

653
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,594
Me, too.

654
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:28,305
<i>And that's how Michael got his</i>
<i>mother's rights to the movie.</i>

655
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,849
<i>But not right away.</i>

656
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:43,237
So happy to help.

657
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,238
Me, too.

658
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,656
- So, everything else is good?
- Yeah.

659
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:49,159
You've talked to your sister,
the radical?

660
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,203
Yeah. She's a redhead now,
and she's dating Herbert Love,

661
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:52,996
but other than her looks
and her belief system,

662
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,498
- Oh...
- she's the same old Lindsay.

663
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,376
So that's Lindsay in the photo.

664
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:59,086
And I hear you're dating
an actress...

665
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:00,588
who's also dating Ron Howard?

666
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:01,589
(wry laugh)

667
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,131
No, no...
no, no, no, no, no, no.

668
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,300
She is not dating
Ron Howard, Mother.

669
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:06,552
Ron Howard is her father, okay?

670
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:08,011
(Michael chuckles)

671
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:10,055
Your mind...

672
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:12,224
I did, though, actually
find out who she is dating.

673
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,226
<i>Michael had found out,</i>
<i>earlier that day,</i>

674
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,686
<i>when he visited</i>
<i>her apartment to head off</i>

675
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:20,315
<i>any ill feelings</i>
<i>she might have about this...</i>

676
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,775
I'll do everything
in my power to make sure

677
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:22,984
she never dates you again.

678
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:24,027
<i>Or this...</i>

679
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,279
You are ruining
my life, Ron Howard!

680
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,447
Nice, right?

681
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,906
Is too big.

682
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:30,200
She likes small.

683
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:32,119
LEM:
Can I please have ice cream?

684
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,330
No, no, you are a Depardieu.
No sweets.

685
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:37,416
Getting excited about Cinco?

686
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,794
Your Cinco, not ours.

687
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:47,217
<i>Michael wasn't proud</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

688
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,303
Hey, Lem, I can reach
the ice cream and, you know,

689
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:50,804
in my family,
we play a game called

690
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:54,516
"If You Do Something For Me."

691
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,017
Rules are meant
to be broken, huh?

692
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:59,187
I will give you this Dove bar,
if you do something for me.

693
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:00,522
We have Dove bars?

694
00:26:00,564 --> 00:26:02,316
We do. Look at that.

695
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:06,320
Tell me what you know
about this "George Maharis."

696
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:07,279
Not much.

697
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,363
He's old.

698
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:09,698
Is he older than me?

699
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:10,949
A few years.

700
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:12,326
He looks like you.

701
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,287
So, handsome.

702
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:17,665
<i>And that's when Lucille</i>
<i>found a way</i>

703
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,541
<i>to keep the brothers</i>
<i>from colluding.</i>

704
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,209
George Maharis.

705
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:23,211
George--
that's your brother's name.

706
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:24,796
George Oscar Bluth.

707
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:28,509
Yes, uh, George
is Gob's first name, yep.

708
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,884
<i>And that's when Michael</i>

709
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:31,845
<i>remembered something else</i>
<i>strange.</i>

710
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,309
I probably should have
expected that.

711
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:38,310
<i>And then stranger...</i>

712
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:40,145
MICHAEL:
"Love each other..."

713
00:26:40,187 --> 00:26:42,272
Oh, that definitely
sounds like Gob.

714
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:45,108
<i>And he did say he was</i>
<i>seeing someone famous...</i>

715
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,568
...dating someone famous.

716
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,029
<i>And Michael remembered</i>
<i>hearing about that, as well.</i>

717
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,989
Me doth think he hath a lady.

718
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:54,451
- Oh. -And they're both
a bit of celebrities.

719
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,120
Well, that is odd, because I,
I'm also dating a celebrity.

720
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:58,372
If I were you,
I'd put a tail on him.

721
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:00,207
Get a P.I.

722
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,584
Where the hell
am I gonna find a P.I.?

723
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,002
Gene Parmesan...

724
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:05,671
at your service.

725
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:06,672
(screaming)

726
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:07,673
Gene!

727
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,799
He does this to me every time!

728
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,968
- What's he doing here, Mom?
- Oh, he's working for me.

729
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,969
Why'd you scream, then?

730
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:16,431
I thought he was that guy.

731
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,810
Mm.

732
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,980
NARRATOR:
<i>At Lucille's behest,</i>

733
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:27,108
<i>Michael borrowed the family</i>
<i>P.I. to follow his brother.</i>

734
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,194
GENE:
He just drove by. Pick me up.

735
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:31,780
MICHAEL:
This is the great disguise, huh?

736
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:33,156
Fry cook!

737
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:35,075
Oh, no, no,
this is my horrible night job.

738
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:37,202
In fact, I was hoping
you could drop me off

739
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,870
at Chicken Dan's
when we're all done.

740
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:39,913
Chicken Dan's, huh?

741
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:41,498
That is embarrassing.

742
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,667
This from a man who's driving
around a mapping car?

743
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,586
You know, I don't even think
these things work.

744
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:47,546
That's why I rely
on these babies right here--

745
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:48,880
the old binocs.

746
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:51,007
Let's see if we can't find
this target.

747
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,051
You know, the great thing
about these is,

748
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:55,763
there's no software to update...

749
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,514
- Oh, God, what are you doing?
- Sorry.

750
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,182
Oh, these binoculars
make me nauseous.

751
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,350
MICHAEL:
Well, of course they do.

752
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,851
Why don't you just use the maps?

753
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:04,479
- No. -We're in
a satellite-linked mapping car.

754
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:07,315
No, no. Sometimes
the old ways are the...

755
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:08,567
- Hey.
- You-you better pull over.

756
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:09,777
- All right, hang on.
- Pull over!

757
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,194
One, two.

758
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,237

No. DeBrie, come on. (laughs)

784

<i>Oscar did indeed borrow a boat</i>
<i>and left it idling,</i>

785
00:29:02,245 --> 00:29:06,082
<i>which unfortunately, was what</i>
<i>this man was looking for.</i>

786
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:08,627

What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

791
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,471
We made plans...
to escape on the boat!

792
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:21,640
I never made plans with you.

793
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:25,268
But we talked
about it on the phone,

794
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,020
when you were trying
to talk dirty to me.

795
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,480
- Oh.
- What is wrong with you?

796
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:30,357
This is... this is embarrassing.
Full disclosure.

797
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:31,859
Uh, that was Oscar,

798
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,902
who may have been the one
you were talking with.

799
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:37,113
He's been filling in...
for me occasionally.

800
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:40,784
Filling in?
As in, visiting me?

801
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,620
You sent your brother
to have sex with me?

802
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:45,330
No, I sent him to listen to you

803
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,374
one time, and then,
he found out about the wall,

804
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,042
and tried to get you
talking about it,

805
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,879
and this was his way
of shutting you up.

806
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,088
- He told you this?
- No, you told me

807
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,465
when I visited.

808
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,343
I got in there
a couple of times... too.

809
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,845
Oh, but not for sex.

810
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:01,763
I don't have the tiger
in my tank anymore.

811
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:03,557
Maybe I do need a vacay.

812
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:04,933
So, tell me about this trip.

813
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:06,685
That's interesting.
Where we going?

814
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:08,311
I'll tell you where we're going.

815
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:09,855
We're going to court.

816
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:11,981
We're getting a real divorce.

817
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:14,442
You're out of the marriage.

818
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:16,319
Lucille...?

819
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:19,573
<i>And that's when she came</i>
<i>face to face with the man...</i>

820
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,241
<i>...whose face</i>
<i>she'd just faced...</i>

821
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:22,910
- Are you ready?
<i>...but it was a different...</i>

822
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,536
<i>- It-it was Oscar.</i>
- Hello, Oscar.

823
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:26,621
You should get an Oscar
for your portrayal of George

824
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:28,665
in "Screw the Oblivious
Sister-in-law."

825
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:31,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

826
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:32,794
You-you got me.

827
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,671
I was gon...
I was gonna tell you.

828
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,965
I was acting
when I pretended to be George,

829
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:39,133
but I am dead serious when I say

830
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:42,763
you are the hottest woman
I know.

831
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:47,601
I'm here tonight because
I want to run away with you.

832
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,143
Oscar. Really?

833
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:50,896
Of course. What?

834
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:53,648
Do you think I'm here for the
donkey punch? Which I do love,

835
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,650
and it's the only night
you can get it.

836
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,737
But you are the only woman
for me, Lucille!

837
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:02,198
Bring me those thin,
pot-stained lips.

838
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,951
Oh, honey.

839
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,786
(both moaning)

840
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,537
- What's this?
- I have no idea.

841
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,080
<i>And that's when she found out</i>
<i>the latest thing</i>

842
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:11,165
<i>that was hers</i>
<i>that had been claimed.</i>

843
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:13,710
<i>He'd actually acquired it</i>
<i>earlier that night</i>

844
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,837
<i>when he was... polling</i>
<i>for Lucille 2.</i>

845
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:18,339
- That, um...
- She's claimed you!

846
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:20,592
Everyone I know wants
to take everything away from me!

847
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:21,843
No! That's not true.

848
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,177
I love you.

849
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:25,096
I don't know if it's the maca.

850
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:26,848
I've just been so randy lately.

851
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,183
But you're...

852
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,477
you...

853
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:32,228
you're my kind of Lucille!

854
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,480
Get away from me, you liar.

855
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:35,607
I can't believe
you were with her.

856
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,275
She's finished.

857
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,778
And the Oscar goes, too!

858
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,154
To...?

859
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:42,614
Get out of my sight!

860
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:43,949
<i>She was in an emotional storm</i>

861
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:45,993
<i>and could have used</i>
<i>a therapist.</i>

862
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,953
- Oh, my God...
- TOBIAS: Lucille!

863
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:49,955
<i>- When she ran into a therapist</i>
- Where are you going?

864
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:51,581
<i>who could've used a storm.</i>

865
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,082
To disappear.

866
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:55,002
That's what everyone
wants me to do.

867
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:57,963
Lucille!

868
00:31:58,005 --> 00:32:00,173
You are not the villain.

869
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,133
(sighs)

870
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:04,052
I'm so tired
of being the villain.

871
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:05,553
Well, those days are over.

872
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:08,723
What you are
is the Invisible Girl.

873
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,391
You make it impossible
for people

874
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,226
to see you in order
to protect yourself.

875
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:13,770
<i>And somehow, in that moment,</i>

876
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:15,188
<i>something changed for her.</i>

877
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:16,606
I do do that.

878
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,525
And in this way, you launch

879
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,276
sneak attacks,
and you create a force field

880
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:21,695
to keep people away.

881
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,738
Right! I'm not a villain.

882
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,490
I'm the Invisible Girl!

883
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,034
Yes, that's what I'm saying!

884
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:30,286
Oh, you know, it's funny...
I never would have

885
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,540
come to this if it hadn't been
for Lucille 2's rehab.

886
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:37,085
I need to pay her back
for everything she's done to me.

887
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:40,047
I'm going back to rehab.

888
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:44,009
I just have
to make one quick stop first.

889
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,719
I don't think we have time.

890
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,345
<i>And that's the night</i>
<i>that Lucille decided</i>

891
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,847
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>to be invisible anymore.</i>

892
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:50,598
I've got to do this...

893
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,060
<i>And perhaps, ironically,</i>
<i>it was also</i>

894
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:57,522
<i>the night that Lucille 2</i>
<i>became the Invisible Girl.</i>

895
00:32:57,564 --> 00:32:59,190
(explosion)

896
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:03,737
<i>Tobias boards the boat</i>

897
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:05,864
<i>originally meant</i>
<i>for Lucille's escape,</i>

898
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:09,617
<i>and after making one stop,</i>
<i>faces the awful truth.</i>

899
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,162
They're going to be talking
about this bomb for years.

900
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:15,456
TOBIAS:
Oh, God, it is bad, isn't it?

901
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,667
Lindsay was right
to discourage me.

902
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:21,546
- Tobias?
- Marky?

903
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:23,631
If you're not Lindsay,
then where is Lindsay?

904
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,092
Isn't that her
on the love boat?

905
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,761
- But I just put a bomb
on the love boat! -What?!

906
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:29,303
- Lindsay! Lindsay!
- Lindsay! Lindsay!

907
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:30,638
Lindsay, there's a bomb!

908
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:34,475
<i>Lindsay remembers</i>
<i>she's on a boat...</i>

909
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:35,393
Oh, (bleep)

910
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:37,478
<i>...that Marky had intended</i>
<i>to bomb.</i>

911
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,230
You gotta get off the boat!

912
00:33:39,272 --> 00:33:40,648
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>to be kind of romantic.</i>

913
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,734
Bomb!

914
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,194
(whoops)

915
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:48,698
<i>...that Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>have matching suitcases.</i>

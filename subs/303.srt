1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,901
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,584
<i>Michael Bluth and his family were
meeting with their new attorney.</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,920
Look, this is not the first time I've been
brought in to replace Barry Zuckerkorn.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,256
I think I can do for you
everything he did...

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,955
plus skew younger...
with juries and so forth.

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,691
Any other questions?

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,791
Yes. How can you be even cuter in person
than you are in your ads?

11
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,393
<i>Are you a CEO, CFO or other executive...</i>

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,803
<i>facing these or similar charges?</i>

13
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:45,867
Why should you go to jail for
a crime someone else... noticed?

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,745
You don't need double-talk.
You need Bob Loblaw.

15
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,783
<i>Bob Loblaw</i> no habla espanol.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,445
Well, we're not here to talk
nonsense to Bob Loblaw.

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,886
We need to find out if the government
has a good case against us.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,891
I mean, there is a lot of proof that
my father was building houses in Iraq.

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,723
Well, your father claims he was
put up to it by a British syndicate.

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,423
- And you've been threatened. Isn't that correct?
<i>- It was.</i>

21
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,729
How would you like someone going after
some stupid person in your family?

22
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,565
Now, back off, you!@%$# ponce!

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,400
It's been a week.
Nothing's happened.

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,600
Yeah, but you're not the one stuck
under house arrest like a sitting duck.

25
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,609
Oh, yeah. That's my father.

26
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,236
That's why we had the meeting
here... so he couldn't interfere.

27
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,748
Interfere? I oughta pull down
your pants and spank your ass raw.

28
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,251
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

29
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,789
Oh, yes. This is Larry Middleman.
He's your father's surrogate.

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,154
- Surrogate?
- That's right, you dumb!@%$.

31
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,250
I hired this guy to wear
a camera in his hat...

32
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,091
so he could be my eyes and ears
while I'm stuck in this penthouse.

33
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,224
This camera helps me
keep tabs on you idiots...

34
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,427
while this thing rubs my ankle raw.

35
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,994
- I mean, look at this thing.
- I can't even go in the hallway...

36
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,440
- Without hearing that...
- Beep, beep, beep.

37
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,273
That's one of my partners.
Excuse me.

38
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,745
Uh, I would like to be
one of your partners.

39
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,647
Do you think he got that?
The two meanings?

40
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,651
He's running pretty fast.
I think he did.

41
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,653
Well, he was flirting earlier.
I'll tell you that.

42
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,656
Just so you know,
I'm looking to get divorced.

43
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,282
- Are you interested?
- Yes.

44
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,133
Let's call that a half hour.

45
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,203
- So you're not the only one who's got a date later.
- You've got a date?

46
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,330
Her name's Rita. She teaches children at
a private school, and we're just having lunch.

47
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,534
Oh, lunch. Well, you better
bring some dog food.

48
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,204
All the girls you date are dogs.
Dogs love dog food, right, Pop?

49
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,577
Shut up, you idiot.
I'm trying to watch the game.

50
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,116
Just trying
to make you laugh, Dad.

51
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,914
- It's all I ever wanted.
<i>- Smith the catcher...</i>

52
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,751
You know, Gob, she's not a dog.
It's just the opposite actually.

53
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:42,920
She's exquisitely beautiful. She's fun,
carefree, smart, full of surprises.

54
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,430
<i>Including the fact that
she was working with this man...</i>

55
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,865
<i>who was currently
dropping her off for her date.</i>

56
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,267
Now all this fun and carefree act
is only gonna fool him for so long.

57
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,035
- I'm a big girl.
- Yeah. Well, if he finds out what you really are...

58
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,838
he might not make things
so simple for you.

59
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,346
Rita, don't forget your hat.

60
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,550
- Who am I kidding? She's too good for me.
- How do you think I feel?

61
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,181
Bob Loblaw's a handsome,
professional man...

62
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,886
and I'm only used to...
well, none of those things.

63
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,054
Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting
that I was a professional twice over?

64
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,895
An analyst and a therapist.
The world's first "analrapist."

65
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,767
Yes, and you were almost arrested
for those business cards.

66
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,399
Yes. No, it did not look good on paper, but
I didn't stop because of the police inquiries.

67
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,636
I stopped to raise our little daughter.

68
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,202
But since we both have started
to grow hair in unexpected places...

69
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,148
I suppose I shall soon
be working as a leading man...

70
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,412
and she may soon start dating.

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,080
<i>Maeby had already started dating.</i>

72
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,214
Another date with, uh, Steve Holt?

73
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,452
Yeah. We're gettin' pretty serious.

74
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,621
<i>They weren't. She was just avoiding her</i>
<i>real crush on George Michael.</i>

75
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,596
That Steve sure knows
how to please a lady.

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,500
Good. I was hoping
he would be gifted sexually.

77
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,062
I guess it makes sense. You know,
uh, older guys expect certain things.

78
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,268
- They do?
- What a fun, sexy time for you.

79
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,777
I'd be very careful
of these British people.

80
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,746
They're gonna try to get their hands
on any evidence they can to hurt the family.

81
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,749
So you're saying shred the evidence?

82
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,082
No, that's illegal. The prosecution
is entitled to that evidence.

83
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,918
- Without it, they don't have a case.
- So shred the evidence?

84
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,118
That's a felony. And I certainly couldn't
endorse anything like that.

85
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,161
Got ya. Wink.

86
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,697
Wink. Did you say wink?

87
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,323
- Or did you wink?
<i>- He said that too, Dad.</i>

88
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,299
We'll talk soon, folks. Thank you.

89
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,099
Where are you going?
Where is the surrogate going?

90
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,141
Stay there. I want to see what
he's gonna say. Don't leave.

91
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,142
See ya, Pop.

92
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,906
You know, Gob, instead of trying
to impress your fake father...

93
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,175
maybe you should spend
some time with your real son.

94
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,446
- Steve Holt's not my son.
- Steve Holt? The moron jock?

95
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,986
That's my son, you pothead.

96
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,615
- Hey, that's my son!
- Wait. So that means that Steve Holt is my cousin?

97
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:56,286
- And Maeby's cousin too.
- I guess. Shoot, I'm late for my date.

98
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,559
Yeah. At the kennel!

99
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,898
You lobbed that one right over
the plate, Michael. Home run.

100
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,200
<i>And Michael hurried to the British
section of Orange County for his date.</i>

101
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,071
Crazy American!
Get out of the road!

102
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,545
<i>Only to find that Rita had chosen Wee</i>
<i>Britain's one American-themed restaurant.</i>

103
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,047
Oh, hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

104
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,984
Oh, no bother. I've been having
such fun on this spaceship.

105
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,419
Strike one, huh?
Shall we go ahead and sit down?

106
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,429
Hey, dudes, I'll get you
a couple of 64-ounce colas...

107
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,761
to wash down
this basket of doughnuts...

108
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,267
I guess this is what
the British think of Americans.

109
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,032
- We like our food.
- Whatever do you mean?

110
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
Yeah.

111
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,899
Uh, you know, uh, Rita,
you're gonna figure this out eventually...

112
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,571
but I have not been on a date
in a long, long time.

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
- Neither have I.
- I wonder why.

114
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,910
I'll bet men
ask you out constantly.

115
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,386
Not men like you. I seem
to only meet little boys.

116
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,616
Part of that might be that
you spend your day at a preschool.

117
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,193
And they think the stupidest things are funny.

118
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,762
Yeah, that's a cultural problem
is what it is, you know.

119
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,696
Your average American male
is in a perpetual state of adolescence...

120
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,699
you know,
arrested development.

121
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,701
<i>Hey, that's the name of the show!</i>

122
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,864
No attention span. You know,
can't even carry on a typical conver...

123
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,273
<i>Michael thought he spotted the man
who'd threatened him earlier.</i>

124
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,869
Well, I'm gettin' back
on the space shuttle.

125
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,880
No, no, no. Sorry. Sorry.
Sit, please.

126
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,746
Let's talk about you.
Tell me about your family.

127
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,379
Well, they're pushy, bossy,
want to control me.

128
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:34,051
What about your family?
I'd love to meet your family.

129
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,650
<i>Michael knew from experience...</i>

130
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,356
<i>that this would not turn out well.</i>

131
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,230
Once or twice a week,
we get a...

132
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,235
Have a little more.

133
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,067
If you like the small, why don't
you come back for the medium?

134
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,110
Right? You can see that, right?

135
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,702
I probably should
warn you about my mother.

136
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,681
- Hi.
- Let's start behind the fridge.

137
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,480
<i>So he came up with
a solution so simple...

138
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,578
<i>he wondered why he'd
never told anyone it before.</i>

139
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,487
I don't have a family.

140
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,356
I can't believe I've never
told anybody that before.

141
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,521
That's so sad.

142
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,997
Yes, sad. Super sad.
Shall we eat?

143
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,204
<i>Michael had started a relationship...</i>

144
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,274
<i>by lying about the existence
of his family.</i>

145
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,366
I think this went
really well, huh?

146
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,105
- Maybe sometime we can have dinner?
- Could I see your house?

147
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,875
<i>Michael was caught
off-guard by the question.</i>

148
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,880
No. No. I... I can't do that.

149
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,887
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Uh, bye.

150
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,890
<i>And he vowed not to be
caught off-guard again.</i>

151
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,552
I didn't mean that we...

152
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,562
So did he invite you over, then?

153
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,258
Not yet, but he will.

154
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,199
<i>So Michael went back to work.</i>

155
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,567
Hey, who brought in the wood...

156
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,243
Gob, you can't shred this evidence.
You'll end up in jail.

157
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:03,247
Dad told me to.
How can I say no to that face?

158
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,841
Get this stuff out of here and put it
somewhere where Dad can't get to it.

159
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:11,754
- Are you in on this too?
- No, I'm just here to go out
to lunch with your father.

160
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,520
<i>And he said he's never
felt more free in his life.</i>

161
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:19,257
<i>- I'm like a bird up there.</i>
- Did you tell him about my medal?

162
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,459
- Medal? What for?
- Oh, who knows what they were saying.

163
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,036
- Do you agree? Say thank you.
- Thank you. Wow.

164
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,941
- I have so many people to thank.
- Private Asher, step forward!

165
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,309
It's probably because
a seal bit off his hand.

166
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,975
The army has taken to giving
medals for being food.

167
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,952
- <i>Just then...
- Look at him go tied to that deck chair!</i>

168
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,353
It's so simple.
My ankle monitor...

169
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,790
only goes off when
I go out the front door.

170
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,294
We need balloons.
A party!

171
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,956
- We need to throw a party for...
- Buster's stupid thing.

172
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,431
Larry, go get some balloons.

173
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,595
<i>And Michael found a way
to get Rita to his house after all.</i>

174
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,502
That's a great idea.
Honor Buster tomorrow night.

175
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,371
We'll get the whole family over to
the penthouse, show him our support.

176
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,571
Well, I suppose it's better
than drinking alone. What time?

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,843
Doesn't matter to me. I can't be there.
I've got a date with Rita.

178
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,319
Well, Mom's probably right.
I couldn't stand up to a seal.

179
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,321
I don't really deserve
a medal or a party.

180
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,358
No, you deserve this.
Here, take my business card.

181
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,223
No, no. It's pronounced "a-nalra-pist."

182
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,422
It wasn't really the pronunciation
that bothered me.

183
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,989
You see, Buster, it wasn't the seal
that you couldn't stand up to.

184
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,194
It was Lucille.

185
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,137
Oh, I'm getting chills.

186
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,868
If this was a Lifetime
moment of truth movie...

187
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,876
this would be our act break.

188
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:42,106
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

189
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,513
<i>And later, Lindsay was</i>
<i>on the phone with Bob Loblaw.</i>

190
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,815
I love Tobias, but he's
never fulfilled me sexually.

191
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,889
Can you catalog
for me the various ways...

192
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,890
you'd been promised to be fulfilled...

193
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,153
whether or not said promise
was made explicit?

194
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,388
- You want me to be explicit?
- Yes.

195
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,794
But I will be needing
to get off in four minutes.

196
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,528
<i>Well, let's see if I can't
hit that target for you.</i>

197
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,127
<i>The next day,
on the way to pick up Rita...</i>

198
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:11,107
<i>Michael stopped by his house to make sure
there were no signs of his family...</i>

199
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,337
<i>only to discover there was nothing but.</i>

200
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,381
- What the hell is all this?
- Gob brought all this stuff in.

201
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,712
And, Mom, what is with
all the family photos?

202
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,878
Oh, I'm teaching Buster
to stand up for himself.

203
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,116
- I'm surrogating your mother.
- By wearing her sealskin coat?

204
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,387
Michael, I have tried on everything,
and nothing seems to be working.

205
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,588
I thought the Donna Karan worked.
You just didn't have the right shoes.

206
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,394
Look, I've gotta get rid of any evidence
of my family, including you guys.

207
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,401
Get outta here!

208
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,937
See? Now, <i>that's</i> how
you stand up to Mother.

209
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,007
<i>Meanwhile, worried about Steve Holt's...</i>

210
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,941
<i>sexual expectations,
Maeby tried to cancel her date.</i>

211
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,104
My whole family and I now have
to go to my grandma's house...

212
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,114
- because my uncle lost his hand.
- Awesome!

213
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,241
So you and I can party
alone at your house.

214
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,945
<i>Maeby was too young
to know what to do.</i>

215
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,649
<i>Ironically, in her after-school job
as a movie studio executive...</i>

216
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,421
<i>she’d just green-lit two films
that dealt with the very issue.</i>

217
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,258
- Rock the house.
- All right.

218
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,832
<i>George Michael also
didn't know what to do.</i>

219
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,061
<i>If he pointed out that the two
were cousins to drive them apart...</i>

220
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,469
<i>he might be burning the very bridge
that he one day hoped to cross.</i>

221
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,041
- I'm doing your cousin tonight.
- So are you.

222
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,374
- What?
- She's your cousin too.

223
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,006
<i>Back at the penthouse,
party preparations were under way.</i>

224
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,483
He's not wearing that to the party.
I've got the exact same thing.

225
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,986
No, he was just "analraping" me.
Then Michael barged in...

226
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,785
and kicked us out so he
could shred all the evidence.

227
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,326
- Shred the evidence?
- I thought he didn't want us to do that.

228
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,886
He didn't want us to get into trouble.
He's taking the heat.

229
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,627
He's doing that for us?
And on the night of his date with Rita.

230
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,363
Who he didn't want to bring over here.
Probably because...

231
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,531
let's face it... you people haven't been
great with the others.

232
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,405
Well, in our defense, Mom,
we're not exactly dog people.

233
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,570
- We've got to start being nicer.
- I'm starting right now.

234
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,012
- Buster, the party's not for you anymore.
- Oh, okay.

235
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,983
It's a "welcome Rita" party.

236
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,486
I know where she works.
We can pick her up and surprise her.

237
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:06,217
You're so right.
This is better than a party for me.

238
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,089
Oh, come on. Grow a pair.

239
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,126
You know, we need some weather balloons
for this party, and maybe a tank of hydrogen.

240
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,101
You know, really float those suckers.

241
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,172
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was hiding the evidence...</i>

242
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,002
<i>wherever he could
when he heard from his brother.</i>

243
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,476
<i>Hey, friend. Gob here.
We really want you at the party.</i>

244
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,606
<i>We're really nice now.
And, God, we love you.</i>

245
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,207
Damn it.

246
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,844
<i>And the family picked up
Rita in the only vehicle...</i>

247
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,253
<i>- big enough to hold them all.</i>
- Hey, hey. Excuse me. Rita?

248
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,952
- I'm Rita.
- We're here to pick you up for Michael.

249
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,188
Uh, you can just go in the cabin.

250
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,768
- Michael?
- Oh, he's not here.

251
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,238
- We're his family.
- Oh, his family.

252
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,435
- We're nice.
- I'm sorry. I have to leave.

253
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,876
Oh, no, you cannot leave.
Drive, Lindsay!

254
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,949
- Bye!
- We're doing this for Michael.

255
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,279
- Stop her, Buster.
- What am I supposed to do?

256
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,548
- Stop her! - Stop yelling at me!
- I'm leaving!

257
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,089
<i>And that's when Buster
noticed the seal on Rita's backpack.</i>

258
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,795
Hey, talk about cathartic.
Now, <i>that's</i> an act break.

259
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,574
<i>Buster had overcome his fear of seals.</i>

260
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,271
<i>Unfortunately, he'd done so by
knocking out Michael's new girlfriend.</i>

261
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,848
- What the hell did you do?
- You curious, Mom?

262
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,747
- I can show you.
- Uh, you made a mistake.

263
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,650
You're human.
Except for the hand.

264
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,122
It's okay. She's alive.
And soft. Soft and alive.

265
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,524
All right, let's not add that
to the charges. What'll we do?

266
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,153
She's gonna tell Michael.
And he won't hear the good stuff.

267
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,425
He'll just hear about the beating.

268
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,764
Wait. Maybe we can give her
a "forget-me-now." Here you go, hot dog.

269
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,338
- Take the pill.
- What's a forget-me-now?

270
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,873
They're pills that create
a sort of temporary "forgettiness."

271
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,308
If somebody finds out how you do a trick, you
give them one, and they forget the whole thing.

272
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,642
- Oh.
- It's a mainstay of the magician's tool kit.

273
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,113
Like how clowns always have
a rag soaked in ether.

274
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,118
Gob, this is flunitrazepam.
It's a roofie.

275
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,711
- Those are illegal!
- Shut up, Mom.

276
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,881
Don't make me give you
another one of these.

277
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,461
Lindsay, help me! Three!

278
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,533
<i>Back at the house,
Michael finished his work...</i>

279
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,569
<i>and, now late,
rushed to pick up Rita.</i>

280
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,130
<i>Moments later, Maeby prepared to tell
Steve she wasn't ready for romance.</i>

281
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,676
Well, this sends a mixed message.

282
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,541
<i>Just as Steve showed up</i>
<i>to call things off with his cousin.</i>

283
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,309
- You did all this for me?
- Yes.

284
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,749
Well, I'm gonna go get sexy.

285
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,016
<i>And Michael missed Rita.</i>

286
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,358
Damn it. Strike two.

287
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:02,093
Take it down. We don't want
anything that says Rita.

288
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,102
<i>Hi. It's Michael.
I will be coming to the party...</i>

289
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,196
<i>because I love you too.</i>

290
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,832
Okay. We need a new banner.

291
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,639
<i>And that's when Michael found Rita.</i>

292
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,646
Rita.

293
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,273
- Why am I on a bus bench, Michael?
- I get it.

294
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,377
I'm sorry. But the rest of the night's
gonna be all about you, I promise.

295
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,388
Great. Great.

296
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,685
I am gonna have to make one quick stop,
maybe you'd just wait in the car.

297
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,283
It's just gonna be
two seconds, I promise.

298
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,228
<i>And so Michael raced up to pay
his quick respects to Buster.</i>

299
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,027
Ah, there he is...
my favorite son.

300
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,432
- Everybody's favorite son!
- Mr. Wonderful!

301
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,869
Well, I had a great time.
I wish I could've stayed longer.

302
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,033
This is a great party, huh?
Tell Buster I stopped by, please.

303
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,134
- I do have to leave.
- Oh, no, no, no.

304
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,305
The party is not for Buster anymore.

305
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,315
- No, Michael. It's for you.
- Me.

306
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,215
Take a look at banner, Michael!

307
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,086
You guys did all of this for me?
"Family love"...

308
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,250
- Michael?
<i>- Everyone froze.</i>

309
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,887
<i>Michael feared he'd been caught
in a lie about his family.</i>

310
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,056
<i>His family feared
they'd been caught...</i>

311
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,966
<i>by a woman they clubbed,
drugged and left on a bench.</i>

312
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,970
<i>It was awkward.</i>

313
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,870
- Who's this?
- Mother! Mother!

314
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,035
This is from the army.
I have to report for duty tomorrow!

315
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,408
It says by accepting this
medal, I was reenlisting.

316
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,413
I didn't hear them say that.

317
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,040
<i>Perhaps if the sergeant had
spoken more slowly, she would have.</i>

318
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,881
In acceptance of this medal, you proudly waive
all rights to private citizenship...

319
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,513
and hereby reenlist in the armed services
of the United States.

320
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,523
If you agree with this,
say thank you.

321
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,991
Thank you.

322
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,258
What am I gonna do?
I can't go back there. I've never been!

323
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,493
- Who are these people?
- This is my family.

324
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,035
No. No.
I don't like these people.

325
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,106
Me. You mean... She means me.
Because I lied...

326
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:52,109
about having a family, because
I was embarrassed by them.

327
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,111
And I'm ashamed of that.

328
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,113
I have to leave.

329
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,882
Strike three.

330
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,114
You said you didn't have a family?

331
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,454
- Everybody's favorite son.
- Mr. Terrible.

332
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,895
And her?
Too good for us? Huh.

333
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,192
Buster, you should've
finished the job.

334
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,564
- Job? What job?
- Did I say job? I meant Gob.

335
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,002
Buster's the one that hit her.
I just gave her the roofie.

336
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,869
- Roofie?
- Forget-me-now.

337
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,875
You beat and drugged Rita?

338
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,372
- Take this and love us again.
- No, no, no!

339
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,540
- Just take it!
- No, Gob!

340
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,914
Um, I'm leaving too.

341
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,648
Well, no good deed
goes unpunished.

342
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,726
Oh, look, it's not all bad.

343
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,558
I got Buster feeling
better about his... medal.

344
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,724
Not anymore.
I'm getting rid of this thing.

345
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,099
It has caused me nothing
but pride and self-respect!

346
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,331
<i>Buster went to get rid of the medal...</i>

347
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,374
<i>he finally felt he deserved...</i>

348
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,410
<i>but it was exactly when George Sr.
was making his escape.</i>

349
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,672
Farewell to you all!

350
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,177
<i>But it turns out that hydrogen
is more explosive than helium.</i>

351
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,026
<i>And George Michael came home
to find an unconscious Steve Holt.</i>

352
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,034
- What have you guys been doing?
- I gave him a roofie.

353
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,070
A girl's gotta grow up sometime.

354
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,537
- He's your cousin!
- My cousin?

355
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,974
I should have told you that. Now you've
drugged him and had your way with him.

356
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,809
- How is that even possible?
- No, George Michael. We didn't do anything.

357
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,406
I just wanted him to think
we did. Don't you see?

358
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,146
I drugged him <i>not</i> to go
all the way with him.

359
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,815
Well, I think even the antidrug people
are gonna be okay with that.

360
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,325
- Well, let's get his pants back on.
- You took his pants off?

361
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,726
<i>And Michael tried to salvage...</i>

362
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,162
<i>the remains of the files
from the car fire.</i>

363
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,860
- You call the attorney?
- Yeah, but he's not taking our calls...

364
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,062
because apparently
the retainer is all used up.

365
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,833
He took my call.
He's very good.

366
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,999
Yeah, that's how the retainer
got eaten up, okay?

367
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,077
The secretary took it all
down here on a transcript.

368
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,578
Ugh. She's very good too.

369
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,513
<i>- I'm not paying for this.</i>
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

370
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:15,986
I don't know, Lindsay. Thing you say on page
seven looks like it could be worth some money.

371
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,356
- Speaking to me yet?
- It's only been an hour.

372
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,658
Here's what I don't understand. What were
you guys doing with Rita in the first place?

373
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,358
We just wanted to do
something nice for you, Michael...

374
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,867
'cause you do so much for us.

375
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,869
I guess we screwed it up.

376
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,872
No, I screwed it up, 'cause
I was trying to impress her.

377
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,340
Let's face it.
She's probably too good for me.

378
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,776
No. What you need to do
is go to her and ask for another chance.

379
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,610
She'd be lucky
to have you, Michael.

380
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,716
Thanks, Gob.
Sometimes you do surprise me.

381
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,289
I've got one more surprise for you.

382
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,685
<i>It ain't easy being wh...</i>

383
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,286
<i>And Michael did try again with Rita...</i>

384
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,026
<i>but this time determined
to keep no secrets.</i>

385
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,228
I wanna tell you everything,
if... if you're willing to listen.

386
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm a very good listener.

387
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,974
Great. We'll start
with the misdemeanors...

388
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:15,478
and then we're gonna push
right on through to the lighter treasons.

389
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,776
So, 1983...

390
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,647
<i>For British eyes only...</i>

391
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,822
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

392
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,825
<i>Lindsay tries to work off
her debt with Bob Loblaw.</i>

393
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,986
I'm willing to debase myself.

394
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,725
Get a maid's uniform
and come by my house around 7:00.

395
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,164
No way to misinterpret that.

396
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,168
<i>Except the one.</i>

397
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,175
<i>And a traumatized Steve Holt
needs a father.</i>

398
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,178
I've made a huge mistake.

399
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,613
I know the feeling.
I had you.

400
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,014
I'm your father, Steve Holt.

401
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,215
I can't hide from it anymore.

402
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,725
I won't forget this, Dad.

403
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,866
I will.

404
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,108
I will.

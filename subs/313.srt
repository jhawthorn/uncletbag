1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,828
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,839
<i>Right now he's being honored
by his family.</i>

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:11,707
Three years ago I made a choice
to keep this family together.

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,907
- Today, it looks like I succeeded.
<i>- So why is this man crying?</i>

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:21,511
<i>Because now he'll have to stay
with these people for a long, long time.</i>

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,590
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,092
<i>and the one son who had no choice
but to keep them all together.</i>

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,396
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,766
<i>Days earlier, Michael awoke
to find his son in his bed.</i>

10
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,334
- Hey, are you scared of a monster?
- Kind of.

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,644
<i>It was the monster called lust,
to which he'd recently succumbed.</i>

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,878
And there's a chance
you might not even be related to us.

13
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,820
<i>And although he'd only
gotten to second base...</i>

14
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,757
<i>he'd gone in head first,
like Pete Rose.</i>

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,760
<i>Then they both got
some distressing news.</i>

16
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,387
And there you are, Maeby,
coming out of your mother's third base.

17
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,398
You guys really are related.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,400
<i>- And that night...</i>
- You're not sleeping in here now.

19
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,302
- You think that's a bad idea?
- What, I mean, so we can make out every night?

20
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,306
Does that not work
for your schedule?

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,639
I mean, I'm sure
we can control our...

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,475
- I'm gonna go sleep with my dad.
- I'm gonna get my job back.

23
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,311
You're probably just a little anxious
because your old man...

24
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,853
is about to start running
a successful company for a change.

25
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,751
So Pop-Pop is definitely
innocent, huh?

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,756
No, not by a long shot...

27
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,349
but they have dropped all the charges,
and not just the Iraq ones.

28
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,827
The embezzlement,
the pension robbing.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,830
I don't know why they dropped them,
but they did.

30
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,026
Let's see if we are on
<i>Mad Money,</i> huh?

31
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,103
<i>And they deliver insulin right to my door.</i>

32
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,503
It's probably on right after this ad.
This is gonna be great for us.

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,474
It's gonna give us a chance
to spend some time together, you know?

34
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,809
It's, like, I don't even know what's going on
in your life. Are there any girls or...

35
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,042
Actually, I've been wrestling
with some pretty taboo...

36
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,948
<i>- The Bluths. I love these guys.
- Shh, here it is.

37
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,181
<i>They beat the treason charges.
We had it as a don't buy.</i>

38
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,689
<i>Let's bump it up to a risky.</i>

39
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,727
Risky! There it is,
we're doing it, huh?

40
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,296
- Are you happy?
- I'm really happy.

41
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,161
- I wonder if we should move out of town.
- What?

42
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,031
I feel like we've heard this whole
out of the woods thing a lot, you know.

43
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,629
- And I just wouldn't mind... - What have
I always said is the most important thing?

44
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,232
- Family.
- I was gonna say breakfast, but...

45
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,335
Why don't we go over to Gangy's,
have a little of both?

46
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,176
Later, we can talk
all this out, huh?

47
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,218
I've heard that
a couple times too.

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,416
<i>And so the family gathered for a celebratory
brunch, catered by a local restaurant.</i>

49
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:44,157
- Hello.
- Risky! Risky! Risky!

50
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,198
Look at that, Buster.
You would have lost a hand anyway.

51
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,995
I'd like to make an announcement.

52
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,832
We need to finish the party
we started three years ago.

53
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,499
Finally name Michael CEO
of a thriving company.

54
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,011
We'll prove to the world that nothing
can tear apart the Bluth family.

55
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,140
In fact, I've already rented
the same boat.

56
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,878
Oh, I'm not comfortable near the ocean
since the seal attack.

57
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,454
- The ocean is my second biggest fear.
- Good, don't come.

58
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,184
I need to be rubbing elbows,
not working your fork.

59
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,453
- We'll find a new venue.
- Oh, and before I forget.

60
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,529
No magic, Gob.

61
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,460
Where is Gob?

62
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,465
Oh, who knows?
I don't even know where he lives.

63
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,035
- He doesn't live at Michael's?
- I've always pictured him in a lighthouse.

64
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,401
Doesn't matter. Mom, I'm just
really flattered that you're willing to do this.

65
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,272
And I was half worried that you'd all
be eager to sell your shares and cash out.

66
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,571
We can do that?

67
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,547
Yeah, but Stan Sitwell's always had
a wild hair to buy this business.

68
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,981
It's the only hair
he's got. What?

69
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,576
- He's an alpaca.
- He has alopecia.

70
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,385
Lindsay, you know, if we did sell, it would
only mean like, what, two million dollars each.

71
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,892
Two million! Two million!

72
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,895
That sounds like a lot more
than it actually is.

73
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,592
You've already spent $1,200 on eggs,
and that would be it forever.

74
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,670
Keep in mind, we are building something
that is not only for our kids...

75
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,965
it's also for George Michael
and Maeby's kids too.

76
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,598
We can't have kids.
What's the matter... What are you say...

77
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,303
- It's not even an option really.
- Eventually you'll want to.

78
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,073
Sure, I may want to, you know, now.
It doesn't matter.

79
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,741
Either way, I won't do
anything about it. Come on!

80
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,909
Michael's right.
And I, for one, will not go back...

81
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,113
to wondering whether there's going
to be enough food on the table.

82
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,417
Might wanna start worrying about the table.

83
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,585
It's fine for you to say, "Don't sell,"
but I'm gonna be 40 in three years, you know?

84
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,721
You know, being twins,
our birthdays are pretty close to one another.

85
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,596
Yeah, but a 40-year-old woman
has as much chance of getting married...

86
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,431
as she does of getting attacked by a shark.

87
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,005
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to say seal.

88
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,166
- Or a seal.
- Oh, God!

89
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,677
You have nothing to worry about. You're a
beautiful woman. Any man would be lucky to have you.

90
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,805
<i>Michael had given this speech
many times to Lindsay.</i>

91
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:47,352
- I'm a giant fat pig.
- I don't know why you say stuff like that.

92
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,853
Girls just grow faster than boys.

93
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,618
Dinner's ready.
We're having Lindsay chops.

94
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:57,788
What? I want her to be prepared in case
some bully at school is as clever as I am.

95
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,298
<i>- No bully ever would be.</i>
- Oh, let's not forget, you're already married.

96
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,800
- Hey, Mikey.
- Yes.

97
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,836
I think I'm gonna
cash out myself...

98
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,905
and maybe go down
to my little place in Cabo.

99
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,669
What little place in Cabo, Dad? Did you build
yourself a hideout in case you needed to escape?

100
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,213
- Of course not.
- I don't want you to worry, Dad.

101
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,942
There's gonna be plenty of money
to be made from a business run honestly.

102
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,383
Oh! Well, your mom's
not gonna allow for that.

103
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,647
She'll do whatever it takes
to get her way.

104
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,350
- You think the banana stand was our idea?
- It wasn't?

105
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,360
<i>It wasn't.
Although they marketed the idea better...</i>

106
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,090
<i>the Frozen Banana itself
was the brainchild...</i>

107
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,723
<i>of a Korean immigrant
who threatened to sue them.</i>

108
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,895
Your mother said she'd take care of it.
The guy was deported to Korea the next day.

109
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,098
<i>Where his business never recovered.</i>

110
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,040
You trying to tell me that all your crimes,
all your dishonesty...

111
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,509
- she was behind it all?
- She's the queen, Michael.

112
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,876
I was her king,
and now it's you.

113
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,881
She may appear
all sweet and innocent and light...

114
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,146
but she has a way
of controlling your behavior.

115
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,517
I'm concerned about you.
Because I do not want to see...

116
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,113
- He'll be fine.
- You'll be fine.

117
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,298
<i>Michael went to cancel the reservation...</i>

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,890
<i>on the party boat
Buster so feared.</i>

119
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,367
- Gob!
<i>- When he saw Gob on a party boat of his own.</i>

120
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,371
You might wanna untie
these ropes first.

121
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,374
- Don't tell me how to flee, Michael.
- What are you doing here?

122
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,242
- I kinda live here.
- Lighthouse wasn't far off.

123
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,371
<i>Perhaps you can tell me
how you can afford a boat.</i>

124
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,814
You mean on the paltry
1,500 a week you give me?

125
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,714
I give you 500 a week.

126
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,652
Yeah, well, somebody's drawing
a little one on those checks. No big deal.

127
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,816
I was planning on using
my Bluth Company stock to pay for it.

128
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,984
Sitwell's made me
a pretty nice little offer.

129
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,961
- About that, Gob, you cannot sell now.
- I have to.

130
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,589
Gob, you're gonna burn through this money
and have nothing, all right?

131
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,600
You give a man a fish,
he'll eat for a night.

132
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,364
- If you teach a man to fish...
- He'll wanna use your yacht.

133
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,167
I don't want this thing smelling like fish.
I'm burning through my future for it.

134
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,708
But you wouldn't understand that
because you're a robot.

135
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,008
Although I don't suppose you'd be willing
to have the company buy it.

136
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,844
<i>Well, you can't let Gob sell those shares.</i>

137
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,975
What am I supposed to do?
He won't give up the yacht.

138
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,111
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Keep your weight off it.

139
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,156
- So lease it to him through the company.
- That just doesn't feel right.

140
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,749
<i>Oh, really?
How would it feel to lose the company...</i>

141
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,352
<i>to a man who has less hair on his!@%$
than I have on my!@%$#.</i>

142
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,762
It can't be worse
than hearing that just was.

143
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,096
I couldn't see through the glasses,
and I slid into the ladder.

144
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,262
<i>Give Gob the boat. We need
to show the shareholders at this party...</i>

145
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,272
<i>that the family is united.</i>

146
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,708
It's a very small concession
to an important cause.

147
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,406
<i>And so Michael sold out just a little.</i>

148
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,779
Fine, I will give him the yacht.

149
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,182
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal.

150
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,187
Well, you said we could talk later.

151
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,952
- Yeah. You excited about the party?
- I actually might skip that.

152
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,995
What are you talking about? This party
is essential for the stockholders to see.

153
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,156
I mean, we gotta show them
how close this family really is.

154
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,258
This was as good an opening
as George Michael was going to get.

155
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,735
- Maeby and I made out.
- Sorry?

156
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,707
- Me too.
- What do you mean, Son? You kissed?

157
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,471
Even a little more than that.

158
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,479
I thought she wasn't
my real cousin.

159
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,209
But then Uncle Tobias showed us
these really rough pictures...

160
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,717
that proved that she was really
Aunt Lindsay's daughter.

161
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,585
I just feel like I can't
be around her or Aunt Lindsay.

162
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,056
They were really rough pictures.

163
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,684
No, I remember their birth announcement
like it was yesterday.

164
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,830
I mean, I know it's wrong,
you know, but my feelings are real...

165
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,833
even if it was a mistake.

166
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,427
Well, obviously,
acting on those feelings is not an option.

167
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,871
She's a blood relative.

168
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,103
I know.
I've seen the blood.

169
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,113
- How long has this been going on?
- I don't know... 53 weeks?

170
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,683
I can't be around her
with these feelings anymore...

171
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,684
and that's why I'm not
going to this party.

172
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,244
<i>And so Michael
made another compromise of his values...</i>

173
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,555
<i>- for the sake of the business.</i> - Whatever
happened to that Ann we were both so crazy about?

174
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,289
You know, maybe you could
bring her to the party.

175
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,855
Yeah, Ann is the girl for us.

176
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,869
<i>Michael's sister, meanwhile,
was doing some selling out of her own.</i>

177
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,372
I'm not going to sell my five percent,
even though you haven't made an offer.

178
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,036
- Which would be how much, by the way?
- Five percent?

179
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,909
Lucille actually gave you less
than her natural children.

180
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,917
I hope that's not a crack about
my hair color, lips, forehead, nose and teeth.

181
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,817
Because at least I'm not wearing
a rayon sweater set on my face.

182
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,449
It's alpaca actually. Cruelty-free.
Really narrows your choices.

183
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,518
But that's not what I meant
when I said "natural child."

184
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,826
Wait a minute.
You're saying I'm adopted?

185
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,561
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
Have I upset you?

186
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,298
Are you kidding me? This is the happiest
I've been since the day I got my new nose.

187
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,170
- I'm not a Bluth.
- You were almost a Sitwell.

188
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,506
But 37 years ago, the Bluths
adopted you out from under us.

189
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,479
So, we said good-bye to you,
our darling, little three-year-old.

190
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,780
Uh, wait, three-year-old?
You said it was 37 years ago.

191
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,980
Oh, yeah, right. Hey, we should
do something for your 40th next week.

192
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,580
<i>This part of the news
Lindsay didn't take that well.</i>

193
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,423
!@%$, let me!@%$#%!@$%#@!

194
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,429
Get your!@%$#%!@$%#@!

195
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,761
Be gentle, she's almost 40!

196
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,767
<i>Maeby, meanwhile,
had returned to Tantamount Studios...</i>

197
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,100
<i>where the word was
she was to be replaced...</i>

198
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,141
<i>when it was discovered
she was not the age she claimed to be.</i>

199
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,268
- Please don't fire me.
- Fire you? Are you kidding?

200
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,212
I've already gotten 10 requests
for the TV rights to your story.

201
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,840
You gotta get your family
to sign the release papers.

202
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,387
This is the biggest thing to happen
since Uniprod hired that wee-brain...

203
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,388
to run drama development.

204
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,251
<i>Michael had compromised his morals...</i>

205
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,489
<i>and was having trouble sleeping.</i>

206
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,963
<i>Of course, some of that
was Lindsay.</i>

207
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,193
- Are you drunk?
- A little. We need to talk.

208
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,295
Yeah, I'll say.
Are you aware that your daughter...

209
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,306
and my son
have been getting physical?

210
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,308
I mean, can you imagine
anything more inappropriate?

211
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,141
- Hey, I guess you can. What are you doing?
- I'm not your sister.

212
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,807
- What? Hey, Lindsay.
- I'm adopted. And I'm three years older.

213
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,975
- There must be some mistake.
- No, Mom confirmed it.

214
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,110
And I know you've always
found me attractive.

215
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,054
You've been telling me that
for the last 40 years.

216
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,216
Please, Lindsay, this is crazy.

217
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,385
If I don't get divorced
and remarried in the next month...

218
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,157
I'm gonna sell those shares
and I'm gonna cash out.

219
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,700
- So what do you say? <i>- But even Michael
couldn't sell out that much.</i>

220
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,497
I'm just not that into older women.

221
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,173
- You bastard!
- Aah!

222
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:22,006
<i>Michael had just found out his sister was adopted.</i>

223
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,514
<i>And the next morning,
he awoke to a worse surprise.</i>

224
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,517
Oh, come on!

225
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,712
I can't sleep
in the same room as her.

226
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,880
She wants out of
this marriage, fine.

227
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,448
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to sell the Bluth shares and move on.

228
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,393
- You can't do that.
- They're my shares.

229
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,762
No, I mean, you can't
spoon me like that.

230
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:47,032
We need a new venue for the shareholders' party,
and it cannot be a boat.

231
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,269
Now, if you can find something,
maybe I can fudge the books.

232
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,904
Get you a Bluth Company salary, huh?
Maybe call you an events coordinator.

233
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,915
Can we just lay here for a second
while I think about it?

234
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,645
<i>Michael was making
compromises all over the place.</i>

235
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,653
Sure.

236
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,887
- I'll do it.
- Sounds great.

237
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,621
<i>Soon, George Michael
went to Ann's to try to win her back.</i>

238
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,632
<i>But her Uncle Paul told him
that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend.</i>

239
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,568
<i>He also mentioned that we all only
had three more weeks on Earth...</i>

240
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,107
<i>and that fossils were just something
the Jews buried in 1924.</i>

241
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,005
<i>And so, feeling that
he couldn't go home...</i>

242
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,571
<i>George Michael decided to seek out
his own creepy uncle.</i>

243
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,673
<i>And Michael confronted his mother
about the adoption.</i>

244
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,810
Look, she was better off with us.
He wanted to call her Nellie.

245
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,480
Of course. Lindsay is the Nellie
from the photo.

246
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,785
Why didn't you just tell people
she was adopted?

247
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,656
Adopting a child we didn't want
just to stick it to a competitor?

248
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,662
Oh, that would
make us look great.

249
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,927
You're right, Mom. People would have
twisted that story to make you look bad.

250
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,796
I don't see what the big deal is.

251
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:54,532
We loved her just as much
as any of you normal kids. More than Gob.

252
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,507
The big deal, Mom,
is that the family is falling apart.

253
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,101
They're trying to sell their stock,
and I can't promise you...

254
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,442
that I can keep everyone
together until the party.

255
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,039
We'll pay them off.

256
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,984
We'll call it
an accrued cash dividend.

257
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,682
But they won't get their money
until they sign a document at the party...

258
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,021
promising not to sell
for 10 years.

259
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,117
So, it's embezzlement,
bribery and conspiracy?

260
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,128
And a whole lot of love.

261
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,221
All right, and perjury.

262
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,401
- Oh, Michael.
- Hey. Oh!

263
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,030
I booked a perfect location
and some wonderful performers for the party.

264
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,040
We're having it at the Queen Mary.

265
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,940
Queen Mary? That's a ship.

266
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,639
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a chain of popular nightclubs.

267
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,648
Although I haven't been
to this particular location.

268
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,310
- It's on the Long Beach Harbor.
- That's the ship.

269
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,887
Don't worry about it.
They've actually welded it to the dock.

270
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,513
Although, perhaps
I should call the Hot Cops...

271
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,923
and tell them to come up
with something more nautically themed.

272
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,555
Hot Sailors.
Better yet, Hot Se...

273
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,034
- I like Hot Sailors.
- Mm, me too.

274
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:01,072
<i>George Michael was about
to come across a hot seaman of his own.</i>

275
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,767
- Gob?
- What are you doing here? How'd you find me?

276
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,504
My dad said that you were living
down here with your girlfriend.

277
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,842
You know about her?

278
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,007
- Who?
- Ann.

279
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,521
- Her?
<i>- Gob had been dating Ann...</i>

280
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,023
<i>since he awarded her third place
in an inner beauty pageant.</i>

281
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,859
<i>Since then, Ann and her friends
tried to teach Gob about the Holy Trinity.</i>

282
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,899
What? I thought that's what
all you guys lived for.

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,468
<i>While Gob debased everything they believed in.</i>

284
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,730
What about you, you game?

285
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,863
It's really not that big of a deal,
George Michael. I'm 18 now.

286
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,908
And besides we really haven't
even done anything.

287
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,273
Practically nothing.

288
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,938
But what are you gonna do?
The girl obviously needs a man.

289
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,140
<i>And that's when George Michael became one.</i>

290
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,214
<i>Ann was upset.</i>

291
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,950
<i>As was Buster when he saw
the ship where the party was to be held.</i>

292
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,422
<i>And so Michael accepted his congratulations...</i>

293
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,227
<i>all the while looking for his son.</i>

294
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,894
<i>And Buster was approached
by his loving father.</i>

295
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,734
Do you think there's any chance this ship
could break away from the dock?

296
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,899
- We're on a ship?
- Ah...

297
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,068
<i>Maeby was trying
to get the family to sign away...</i>

298
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,304
<i>the TV rights to their life stories.</i>

299
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,745
TV is not as good as it used to be,
huh, Uncle Buster?

300
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,784
But you could help me out
by signing my petition to make it better.

301
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,183
Oh, I kind of like
<i>Skating with Celebrities.</i>

302
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,779
- Excuse me. <i>- Lucille was
trying to get signatures too.</i>

303
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,858
Sign here that you won't sell.

304
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,859
Oh, I don't need to sell, Lucille...

305
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,589
because now I know that we're not related,
I'm going to marry Michael.

306
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,597
I always saw him
with a younger girl.

307
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,826
<i>And Gob, angry at Michael...</i>

308
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,166
<i>- for sending his son to the docks...</i>
- Not related?

309
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,071
<i>Went into a kind of
knee-jerk revenge mode.</i>

310
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,303
Why go for the best
when you can go for the rest...

311
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,139
of your life with a younger man?

312
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,950
Kitty likes to scratch.

313
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,388
Oh, God! Mom! Mom!

314
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,790
Take these forms
to everyone in the family...

315
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,864
and promise them a hundred grand
if they sign.

316
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,662
<i>That's how Maeby found a way
to get signatures on her release forms.</i>

317
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,963
Well, that was a freebie.

318
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,529
<i>And soon, the crowd gathered to hear Michael.</i>

319
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,338
I just wanna say how much
this family really means to me.

320
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,936
My father has always
been there for me.

321
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,982
He's a great man.

322
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,951
My brother Gob, who I know
would never do anything...

323
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,987
to hurt anyone in this family.

324
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,353
<i>Except for dating his nephew's girlfriend...</i>

325
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,018
<i>and hitting on his adopted sister.</i>

326
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,392
Buster, who faced his biggest fear
to be here today...

327
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,523
- Second biggest.
- And my sister, Lindsay.

328
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:46,093
Yes, she is my sister,
no matter what any piece of paper says.

329
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,696
Lindsay and her husband,
Tobias, you know...

330
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,675
deep down, they both love
each other very, very much.

331
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:57,511
Most of all, my mother,
who has always believed in me.

332
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,743
Three years ago
I made a choice...

333
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,247
I made a choice
to keep this family together...

334
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,795
<i>And that's when Michael finally cried.</i>

335
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,364
Today, it looks like I succeeded.

336
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,398
<i>It wasn't exactly a turn-on.</i>

337
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,037
Whoo!@%$# baby.

338
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,544
Looks like George Michael
got his mom back today, huh?

339
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,705
Yeah, well, where is
George Michael, by the way?

340
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,045
He came by the yacht.
Gave me this shiner.

341
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,880
- He hit you? What for?
- You know teenagers.

342
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,386
Probably lashing out at you
because of who I'm dating.

343
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,217
- Who are you dating?
- Ann.

344
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,053
- Her?
- Don't worry. I didn't fight back or anything.

345
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,458
I was, like, "Oh, no, take the yacht.
Please don't hurt me."

346
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,588
- Just build up the little guy's self-esteem.
- The yacht?

347
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,826
Oh, for God's sake, Gob.
I gotta get off this ship.

348
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,733
Mom, George Michael took off in Gob's yacht.
I gotta go find him.

349
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,069
Well, you can't go now. That's not going
to look good in front of the investors.

350
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,143
- Mom, this is important, okay?
- Michael!

351
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,939
This company is important.

352
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,014
<i>It was at that moment that Michael realized...</i>

353
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,606
<i>how much he'd sold out.</i>

354
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:10,211
<i>Never seen a CEO cry like that before,
except at his sentencing.</i>

355
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,586
That's who you're putting in charge?

356
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,750
I've made a huge mistake.

357
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,556
Will you take the company
for 20% above market?

358
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,961
Ten, and I'll take
the company off your hands right now.

359
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,999
Fifteen and I'll throw in Nellie.

360
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,932
- She's 40.
- Twelve.

361
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,164
<i>Meanwhile, Michael searched the harbor...</i>

362
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,435
<i>and spotted the yacht.</i>

363
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,272
<i>And Gob noticed something too.</i>

364
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,646
Are those police boats?

365
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,217
- Oh, my God, the SEC.
- They still have boats?

366
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,186
- Prepare to be boarded.
- Did you do this?

367
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,621
No. But I can't help but enjoy the irony
that you might be losing three years of your life.

368
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:51,219
Ah, this is why they dropped
those other charges.

369
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,322
- You gave me up, George.
- George? I'm not George.

370
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,958
George invited me.
Oh, stupid.

371
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,698
Oscar, when are you going to learn
there's no such thing as free shrimp?

372
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,900
Well, I know it was someone
in this family.

373
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,467
Or someone who used to be.

374
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,376
- Annyong?
- Annyong.

375
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,006
- Annyong?
- Annyong. But my real name is...

376
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,642
- Hello.
- Hello?

377
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,051
- Annyong.
- What the hell did you do this for?

378
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,852
Because my grandfather
vowed one day...

379
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,756
he would get even
for banana stand you stole from him.

380
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,661
<i>It was true. Hello had gathered
information against Lucille...</i>

381
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,825
<i>- Annyong?</i>
<i>- to avenge his grandfather.</i>

382
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,267
Hey, Maeby ever mention
my name?

383
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,669
<i>But Lucille was not going peacefully.</i>

384
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,934
You boys know how to shovel coal?

385
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,409
<i>I don't even wanna tell you
what these guys thought that meant.</i>

386
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,106
<i>And Michael caught up
with his son.</i>

387
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,342
George Michael, what are you doing?

388
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,418
- Where are you going?
- I can't stay here.

389
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,819
Ann's moved on. Maeby's my cousin.
We both know that's not an option.

390
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,291
Buddy, Maeby is not your cousin.

391
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,693
- What?
- Yeah, I found out a couple days ago.

392
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,027
Aunt Lindsay was adopted.

393
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,567
Why didn't you tell me this?

394
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,297
Because you can't be
with Maeby. You're 15.

395
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,034
Inevitably, the relationship is gonna fall apart,
and then what do you do?

396
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,805
She might not be a blood relative,
but she is still family...

397
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,380
and that's a bond
that lasts forever.

398
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,211
You don't wanna rock that boat.

399
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,878
- What the hell was that?
<i>- It was his mother...</i>

400
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,649
<i>who moments earlier
had taken control of another queen.</i>

401
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,316
Full steam, boys!

402
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,224
This is degrading.
I thought we were gonna strip.

403
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,423
Mother!

404
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,497
It's moving! Oh, my God!

405
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,733
<i>And Buster faced his second biggest fear.</i>

406
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,809
- I can't swim! I can't swim!
<i>- And then his first.</i>

407
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,639
Oh, come on!

408
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,115
<i>And the two grand ladies
made their escape together.</i>

409
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,618
<i>Lucille Bluth, please pull over...</i>

410
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,621
<i>and step away
from the historic ship.</i>

411
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,191
- Gangy's trying to make a break for it.
- I guess we should go back.

412
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,192
Family sticks together, huh?

413
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,262
Yeah, on the other hand...

414
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,763
we do have a full tank of gas,
a house in Cabo...

415
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,799
and 500 grand in cashier's checks.

416
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,893
What say we give them
no choice...

417
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,806
but to keep themselves
all together for a while?

418
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,868
<i>It was</i> Arrested Development.

419
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,540
<i>On the epilogue.</i>

420
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:30,054
<i>Michael wakes up to another
strange bedfellow after his first night at sea.</i>

421
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,055
How was the party?

422
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:37,220
<i>And Maeby pitches
her TV show to a Hollywood icon, who says...</i>

423
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,389
No, I, uh...
I don't see it as a series.

424
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,128
Maybe a movie.

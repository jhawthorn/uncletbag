1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:23,472
<i>Michael was heading off</i>
<i>to work when his son, George Michael...</i>

6
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:26,308
- <i>reminded him of a yearly tradition.</i>
- Hey, don't forget me.

7
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:29,281
- For what?
- It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

8
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:31,715
And unless you had a daughter
I don't know about, I'm your girl.

9
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:35,346
<i>Michael had first made</i>
<i>this joke when George Michael was six.</i>

10
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:39,051
Well, she's not my daughter,
but it's about as close as I'm gonna get.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,151
I'm a good little girl.

12
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:44,060
<i>It was a joke Michael was</i>
<i>starting to grow concerned about...</i>

13
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:47,066
- <i>as it had not worn well with age.</i>
- Hey, Dad.

14
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,568
They're out of sanitary napkins
in the ladies' washroom.

15
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:54,232
Weird kid.

16
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:57,311
I don't think this year's such a good idea.
You know you're getting older and...

17
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:00,574
Yeah, right. Pretty soon I'm going to have
to start wearing a bra. Right, Dad?

18
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:03,275
- All right, give me one minute.
- <i>Really, let's not this year.</i>

19
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:05,944
I cannot kill this joke.

20
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:08,419
<i>Hey, shouldn't you</i>
<i>be getting dressed?</i>

21
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:12,083
- Nope. I'm going with my dad to work today.
- Hey, peanut butter cup.

22
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,457
This is work?
Watching entertainment news?

23
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:17,588
Well, excuse me, Michael, for not raising
the perfect daughter that you did.

24
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:20,599
<i>I indulged this ritual</i>
<i>for years in Boston.</i>

25
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:24,637
<i>As a psychotherapist, Tobias was on</i>
<i>the forefront of the self-esteem movement.</i>

26
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:28,766
There's, like, this longing, this pull.

27
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:31,743
I mean, does that make me,
you know, like some kind of...

28
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:35,043
- Homosexual.
- Maeby, please.

29
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:41,154
She's right though.
You probably are a homosexual.

30
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:44,156
So, Maeby, this is what you're gonna do
this year? You're gonna watch him watch TV?

31
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:46,192
<i>Behind the scenes</i>
<i>at</i> Entertainment Tonight.

32
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:50,627
Oh, bless her. It's like she knew
what I was going to do next.

33
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:54,895
It's here! <i>Girls with</i>
<i>- Newport Beach.</i>

34
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,129
From the act I did
on the beach over spring break.

35
00:01:57,238 --> 00:02:00,139
- <i>Any magician</i>...
- <i>Gob had done a magic show...</i>

36
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,836
<i>where he had made the Bluth</i>
<i>family yacht... disappear.</i>

37
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:08,745
<i>It was spring break, and the act</i>
<i>was filmed for the popular video series...</i>

38
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,750
Girls with Low Self-Esteem.

39
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:14,650
This puts me back on top of
the old magic career though.

40
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:16,746
You're not gonna put that in.
There's nudity on that.

41
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:18,757
Maeby, why don't you go
upstairs and get dressed?

42
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:22,192
I must warn you, Michael.
She doesn't respond well to strict directives.

43
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:24,560
All right.

44
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:27,429
- That was odd.
- Not really. Kids love boundaries.

45
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,594
<i>Look at these girls.</i>
<i>Is this what you want?</i>

46
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,104
- Oh, God, no.
- 'Cause this could be where
your daughter is headed.

47
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:34,436
Oh, no, no. I don't want this
for Maeby either, no.

48
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,533
Oh, here it is. Here it is.

49
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,544
<i>It was a wild time on the beach.</i>

50
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:41,547
<i>And if you like magic, look away.</i>

51
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:46,043
<i>The only thing this guy could</i>
<i>make fly away was the crowd.</i>

52
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:49,748
Douche chill.

53
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,485
I can't believe they used that part.

54
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:54,527
The one part where I screw up.

55
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,755
It's not like they used the part
where I made the yacht disappear.

56
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,697
Sunk the yacht.
Blew it up, sunk it.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,700
- We sure did.
- We? No.

58
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:03,702
I gave you permission to use
the yacht. You blew it up.

59
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:06,136
Yeah, well, if you give someone
permission to use a tissue...

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,731
you can't be upset
if they blow their nose.

61
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:11,038
Right? I mean, right?

62
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,376
<i>Lindsay, new outfit?</i>

63
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,643
No, I've had this for years.
It's a hand-me-down from Mom.

64
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,946
- Got a price tag right there.
- Is there?

65
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:22,648
Oh, I guess she wanted me to have
something new. Sweet old thing.

66
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:25,954
Only two of those words describe Mom,
so I know you're lying to me.

67
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,463
Fine. I bought it before we went broke, okay?
I just haven't worn it yet.

68
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:34,159
- What about the outfit yesterday?
- Old Thing gave it to me.

69
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:37,431
- Where are you getting all the money?
- It's not costing you anything.

70
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,403
Unless you're stealing or working,
I'm pretty sure it is.

71
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,737
<i>That's right. I stole it.</i>

72
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:44,504
<i>In fact, Lindsay,</i>
<i>tired of wearing last year's fashions...</i>

73
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:47,809
<i>went to an upscale department store</i>
<i>and in a moment of desperation...</i>

74
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,679
- <i>applied for a job.</i>
- Can I have a job application please?

75
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,049
<i>But she was ashamed</i>
<i>ofbeing a shopgirl...</i>

76
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,418
<i>and was relieved when Michael</i>
<i>gave her the out.</i>

77
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:58,492
Well, they expect a certain amount of theft,
Michael. It's built into the price.

78
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,425
If I didn't take it, then people
would be overpaying for nothing.

79
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,429
You're telling me that you
walked into a store...

80
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,499
and without anyone noticing
took an entire outfit?

81
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,090
<i>There's no way that you could</i>
<i>do sleight ofhand that well.</i>

82
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:10,670
- I don't even think that I could do it.
- Yeah, I've seen your tape.

83
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:14,764
- Lindsay, this is appalling.
- <i>What'd you use for misdirection?</i>

84
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,504
- Misdirection?
- Yeah, I mean, if you're so good at magic...

85
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:21,012
what'd you have them looking at
to divert their attention?

86
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,208
I don't know... my ass.

87
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,444
- My ass. You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

88
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,885
- You're gonna take that back.
- No, I'm not.

89
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,684
This has nothing to do with you.
You're not my father.

90
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,021
No, our father is in prison
for stealing, remember?

91
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:35,288
- Which might not be a bad place
for you to get used to.
- <i>Michael...</i>

92
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,296
it was shoplifting,
and I'm white.

93
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:39,491
- I think I'm going to be okay.
- <i>Shoplifting?</i>

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,331
- Cool. Can you take me?
- <i>No. Hey, not cool. You know what?</i>

95
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:46,565
Maeby, you're gonna come with me
to work today. You're gonna be my daughter.

96
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,665
You're gonna have a role model
in your life who is honest...

97
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:54,510
who doesn't steal, doesn't lie and,
I don't know, watch entertainment news.

98
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,482
Michael, don't worry about it, okay?
She's not gonna go with you.

99
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:59,075
- Okay.
- Great.

100
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,051
That was odd.

101
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,885
I'm going to teach you two a little something
about hands-on parenting.

102
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,652
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

103
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,489
Do you think this purse
goes with this outfit?

104
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,030
- Where'd my dad go?
- Douche chill.

105
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:17,331
<i>And so Michael took his niece</i>
<i>to Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.</i>

106
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:19,065
You can just drop me off
at the mall.

107
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:21,334
Oh, no, you're-you're
really coming with me.

108
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,410
You're gonna learn a little
something about hard work.

109
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,442
Hey, Maeby! Maeby!

110
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:34,416
<i>Okay, so you can run faster than me.</i>
<i>But you can't make me work.</i>

111
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,352
No one's making you
do anything, you know.

112
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,756
It's just a chance for us to spend
some time together. Learn about business.

113
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,455
You know, you might find that you're
good at things you didn't even know about.

114
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,902
See that? Who knew you were
such a good little climber?

115
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:53,039
Now listen,
let's make this fun, okay?

116
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,040
We're family.

117
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:57,542
What is better than hanging out
with family? Hmm?

118
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,909
Oh...
It's my mother.

119
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,346
- Hi.
- She called you, huh?

120
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,474
I guess I'm not good enough
to be her husband.

121
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,485
What? What's going on?

122
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:09,750
Okay. Mother wants someone
to go to my soccer game with.

123
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:12,917
She don't want other soccer moms
think that she a single mother.

124
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:14,061
- She old school.
- I liked it better when he just said <i>annyong.</i>

125
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,495
- She old school.
- I liked it better when he just said <i>annyong.</i>

126
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:19,191
Hey, Mom, why can't Buster
pretend to be your escort?

127
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,133
- That's the way he's got it in all his cartoons.
- They already know he's my son.

128
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,966
I wouldn't go even if you asked.
You didn't let me play soccer as a child.

129
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:27,836
Why should I have to sit and cheer Annyong?
Annyong never cheers me.

130
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,967
Go, fatty.

131
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:34,070
Stop it! He's your little brother!

132
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:36,240
No, he's not!
I came out of you! He didn't!

133
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,808
Can you not call me with
these little things, please?

134
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,150
The office is a mess.
I still haven't replaced Kitty.

135
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:46,283
<i>Michael had recently fired</i>
<i>his father's longtime assistant, Kitty.</i>

136
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,691
Did you hear that everyone?
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

137
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:50,593
- Shh, shh, shh.
- <i>It had not been a clean break.</i>

138
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:53,360
So, I've got a lot of work to do.
Plus, it's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

139
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,061
- Oh, where is George Michael?
- I told him not to come.

140
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,264
l-I thought it was more
important to bring Maeby this...

141
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,934
Damn it! Can't you just find somebody else,
please, to look like your husband?

142
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:09,311
<i>In fact, there was someone else</i>
<i>who looked like Lucille's husband</i>...

143
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,509
- <i>his twin brother, Oscar.</i>
- Lucille.

144
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:15,952
- <i>And although she knew it was</i>
<i>wrong to play with his heart</i>...
- Oscar, it's Lucille.

145
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,547
<i>she really didn't want to go</i>
<i>to the soccer game alone.</i>

146
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:22,459
I need you.

147
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,463
<i>And back at the model home...</i>

148
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:27,193
<i>three of the Bluth men</i>
<i>struggled with their manliness.</i>

149
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:29,735
You know, I make jokes about
being a daughter for my dad.

150
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:32,897
I know I'm a man.
It's his insecurity, not mine.

151
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,475
There's no security at that store.
That's how she was able to shoplift.

152
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,874
They probably don't have
a regular security guard.

153
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,141
Well, of course I could get a job
as a security guard.

154
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,808
I mean, if I have to have a job
to impress my daughter.

155
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,817
If she needs something that butch.

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,752
<i>Yeah. I can hang out with my uncles.</i>
<i>Three men. What's butcher than that?</i>

157
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:51,484
- I'm going to the mall.
- Me too.

158
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:54,220
Yeah, maybe a new pair
of shoes will cheer me up.

159
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:56,990
And now I'm filling out
an expense report...

160
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,430
so I can sleep well at night
knowing that I have been honest.

161
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:02,434
You're not asleep.

162
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,504
- I was.
- You were not.

163
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,869
I would like to see if you could
go one day without telling a lie.

164
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:10,000
just one whole day
without being like your mom.

165
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,375
- What's in it for me if I do?
- You'll win my respect.

166
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,914
- Good night.
- And 50 bucks.

167
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:18,678
Fine. I'll do it if you do it.

168
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:22,950
- That-a-girl. This is gonna be fun.
- I win.

169
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:26,220
- <i>We're looking for Michael Bluth?</i>
- That's me.

170
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:29,625
- I'm Michael Bluth.
- I'm Officer Taylor. That is Officer Carter.

171
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,723
Our daughters, Tammy and Moni...
Oh, God, where... where did they go?

172
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,961
- I'm on it.
- How can I help you?

173
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,471
Well, we're here investigating
the disappearance of Kitty Sanchez.

174
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:42,201
Apparently, you're the last person
to see her... alive.

175
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,202
Or around town or whatever.

176
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:48,907
I don't know anything about that.
I do know that, uh...

177
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,712
she was my secretary,
uh, but she left.

178
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:53,878
<i>Or l-I fired her.</i>

179
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:56,046
<i>Did you ever threaten her?</i>

180
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:57,953
No, no. God, no.
Of course not.

181
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:00,925
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

182
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:03,326
I did. I threatened her
at a restaurant.

183
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,595
- But, you know... it's a restaurant, so...
- Yep.

184
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:11,102
Certainly she's been seen since then?

185
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:14,140
Not alive.

186
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,436
Or dead or whatever.

187
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,602
We'd love to speak with you
down at the station.

188
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:21,943
Sure. Uh, you know,
l-l-I'm happy to cooperate.

189
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,347
But I really don't know
anything more than you know.

190
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:27,579
I certainly didn't... didn't kill her
and drop her in a back bay.

191
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,351
- Boy, I hope that's not what happened to her.
- I'm sure it isn't.

192
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:36,421
Please send Officer Davis
and Little Hanna to the back bay.

193
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,589
So you killed Kitty, huh?

194
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,599
No, I didn't kill Kitty.

195
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:43,295
But I will go down to the station
and answer those nice men's questions.

196
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:47,100
You know why? Because I have no secrets
to hide. Because I'm an honest man.

197
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,300
<i>And apparently a fun one.</i>

198
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,343
Let's go see what's
going on in the back room.

199
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:54,175
Were those the last words
Kitty ever heard?

200
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,579
No. I will not kiss her.

201
00:09:56,683 --> 00:10:00,881
Hey, hey, guys, what are you doing?
It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

202
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:03,047
- Yeah, that's my Caitlin.
- <i>Okay.</i>

203
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:05,352
There is work to be done.
Can we get back to it? Thank you.

204
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,828
Oh, and has anybody,
uh, seen or heard from Kitty lately?

205
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,867
<i>I think that's her</i>
<i>right behind you there.</i>

206
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:18,460
- Oh, my God. That is Kitty.
- And that's the boat that Uncle Gob blew up.

207
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:21,973
<i>Hey, now you have something</i>
<i>to tell them at the station.</i>

208
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:31,615
<i>Tobias sought out a security</i>
<i>position at the nearby mall.</i>

209
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:36,280
I do know stage combat if the partner
is willing and a bit more petite than I.

210
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,724
But I have a daughter to impress
and I need this job.

211
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:44,786
Well, it's gonna be a couple of days
before we can get you a gun license...

212
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:47,992
so you'll have to use mine.

213
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,296
Wow!

214
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,805
<i>Meanwhile, Gob had taken</i>
<i>George Michael on a mysterious errand.</i>

215
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:56,398
What are we getting?
Is it something for a magic trick?

216
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,671
- In a way.
- That's cool.

217
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:01,304
You know, it's so great
to be hanging out with you.

218
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,646
There are certain things that I can talk to
you about that I can't really with my dad.

219
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:08,084
<i>Like, uh, were-were you ever</i>
<i>awkward around girls?</i>

220
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:12,215
What do you mean? Like if there were
three of us and I didn't know where to start?

221
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:14,226
No, I think I did pretty well.

222
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,421
Not a lot of complaints,
if you know what I mean.

223
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,021
At least not from the girl.

224
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,760
- You're saying I should just be myself?
- And he had to drive her home.

225
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:24,837
So I think I did pretty good.
Pretty damn good.

226
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:26,838
- Hey, guy.
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>

227
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,376
How many mice will $13 buy?

228
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:33,002
<i>And at the prison,</i>
<i>George Sr. had a surprise visit.</i>

229
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,240
I just wanted to check in
and make sure you're aware...

230
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:39,012
that your ban on organized sports
in this family has been violated.

231
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:41,053
Ban on organized sports?

232
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:44,180
You know, how you wouldn't let me
sign up for anything when I was a kid.

233
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,590
Is that what you've been
thinking all these years? No, no.

234
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,628
You were... You were
just a turd out there, you know?

235
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,360
You couldn't kick and you couldn't run.
You know, you were just a-a turd.

236
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,800
Prison has destroyed
the way you talk.

237
00:11:56,903 --> 00:12:00,703
If that's what it takes to impress these guys
around here, then they are not your friends.

238
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:04,436
Anyway, Annyong's playing soccer,
but I guess I should just ignore it.

239
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:07,741
Look the other way as Mom and Uncle Oscar
and Annyong have the perfect little family...

240
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait. Oscar? My brother Oscar?

241
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,885
- Oscar's been coming around?
- No touching!

242
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:16,251
No touching. No touching.

243
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:18,984
You listen to me. You've got to
take care of this Oscar situation.

244
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,992
You get him out of there, all right?

245
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,927
You make him wish that he'd never
shown that ludicrous head of hair...

246
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:26,090
and that nice face of his.

247
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,726
- I will do it, Dad.
- Good. Put her there.

248
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,405
- No touching!
- Oh!

249
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:32,429
- No touching!
- Oh!

250
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,474
Her self-esteem is through the roof.

251
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:38,066
<i>And Michael arrived</i>
<i>at the police station with Maeby.</i>

252
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:40,442
I got here as quickly as I could.

253
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,014
- I didn't know you had a daughter?
- <i>I don't.</i>

254
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:44,083
I thought you wanted me
to call you Daddy?

255
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:47,779
Why don't you wait
for Daddy in the car?

256
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:51,119
- All right. What do we have here?
- Gob sunk the yacht.

257
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:54,284
The last time Kitty was seen,
she was getting onto it. It's on tape.

258
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:57,591
- Ooh! Did you see this?
- Yep.

259
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:02,601
Ooh! Chills.
Why do I keep getting these bruises?

260
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,001
- Barry!
- Okay. Until we get all the facts...

261
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:07,471
don't say anything
that can incriminate you.

262
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:10,270
Or me. Just try to
keep me out of this.

263
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:13,835
- Lie. Both of you.
- No, what are you talk...
We don't lie in this family.

264
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:17,110
- Maeby, why don't you get a soda?
- Okay.

265
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:21,586
If I lie in front of her, it costs me 50 bucks.
I do think that we should lie.

266
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:24,723
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Lindsay was at work...</i>

267
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:27,623
<i>and starting to getjealous that</i>
<i>her daughter was at work with Michael.</i>

268
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:30,322
Hello, Michael. I know you think
I'm such a horrible mother...

269
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,864
but I was just seeing how
my daughter was doing at work.

270
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:37,369
Uh, she's, um, she's making
lots of friends already.

271
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,962
- Can you help me there, please?
- <i>It was at this moment...</i>

272
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:42,701
<i>that Gob and George Michael</i>
<i>arrived at the store.</i>

273
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,972
Say what you will about America...
13 bucks stills gets you a hell of a lot of mice.

274
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,979
Who said anything bad
about America?

275
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:51,209
No. Well, I meant...
So what are the mice for?

276
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:53,582
Oh. No, that's just for misdirection.

277
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:57,316
We'll see who the sleight-of-hand artist
is in this family.

278
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:00,416
Okay, now when I yell "Mice!"
I want you to open this box...

279
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:03,587
- and I'm gonna start stuffing
some shirts down your pants.
- Shirts?

280
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:06,495
- Gob, are we shoplifting?
- Mice!

281
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,830
<i>Mice! Call security!</i>

282
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:12,928
- Michael, I'm not as bad
an influence as you think I am.
- Well, you're not a great one.

283
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,973
You're a criminal, Lindsay.
What kind of message does that send?

284
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:17,771
Bluth. We're ready to question you now.

285
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,971
That's what I am, Michael.
I'm a shoplifter!

286
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,980
I've got a whole bag
of clothes I shoplifted.

287
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:25,176
<i>But Tobias was now a guard.</i>

288
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:27,412
<i>And a surprisingly catlike one.</i>

289
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:32,424
- Wow. I guess we didn't need the mice.
- <i>Freeze</i>...

290
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:37,761
<i>While the rest of the Bluths</i>
<i>were in police custody...</i>

291
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,764
<i>Lucille was with</i>
<i>her brother-in-law.</i>

292
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:44,200
I am blown away that you... that you
called me and that we're-we're together.

293
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,636
And my camper made it
all the way up here.

294
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,300
Do you think it's safe over there?
Because I only have a hanger for a lock.

295
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,004
What are they gonna take,
the one can of Comet you've got in there?

296
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:57,573
Oh, your tongue is as sharp
as your body is still taut.

297
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,652
What are you doing?

298
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:04,213
Oscar, this is a children's
soccer game, not Woodstock.

299
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:08,556
That was another era, huh?
The music and the pot.

300
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:12,462
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to my camper for just a quick sec.

301
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,938
Open.

302
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:27,675
- Hey, Uncle.
- Hey, Buster.

303
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,479
No, no, no.

304
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:35,316
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

305
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:39,256
No! No! No! I came here
to say something.

306
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,522
You do not belong here.
My mother's been spoken for.

307
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:47,259
You know, I may never have
played organized sports, but I am a man.

308
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,825
- Buster.
- And I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

309
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,739
Okay. But, uh, I never meant
to break up your family.

310
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:59,334
Your mom called me for a reason.
And I don't think she's happy.

311
00:15:59,446 --> 00:16:03,473
No, she's happy.
She's just mean all the time.

312
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:11,954
Uh, no, no, no, Uncle, let me get you.
I'm a man. Move.

313
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,089
<i>Michael submitted</i>
<i>to the detective's questions.</i>

314
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,929
You haven't seen any evidence of Ms. Sanchez
or where she might have gone?

315
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:24,970
I have, uh, no idea. None.

316
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,631
Are you willing to take
a polygraph to that effect?

317
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,103
- Are you nuts?
- Not without a better lawyer.

318
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:36,774
You're holding out on us!

319
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:38,783
Fantastic. Now Emma's awake.

320
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:42,616
- You know what? Let me take care of this.
- Please.

321
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,027
Kitty had evidence against your father,
and you didn't want that to come out.

322
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,792
But now you've got bigger problems,
my friend. So why don't we make a deal?

323
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,993
I give you evidence against my father,
and you pretend that I didn't kill Kitty?

324
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,332
I mean, l-I didn't kill Kitty.

325
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,470
Hello. Oh, hey,
George Michael.

326
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:06,307
Uh, I'm sorry.
In your pants?

327
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:11,510
I'll be right there.
Um, my son has an emergency.

328
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:15,019
You know, there's a Grover book...
<i>I Can't Hold It In.</i>

329
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:18,386
Worked for us.

330
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:22,951
<i>Buster emerged from Oscar's</i>
<i>trailer with a newfound sense of manliness...</i>

331
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,793
<i>and then received</i>
<i>a serendipitous gift.</i>

332
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:30,497
Kick it back!

333
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:34,665
- If you can kick, fatty.
- I'm a man.

334
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:46,508
What are you doing?
Get off the field!

335
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,679
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

336
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,631
<i>And Buster realized</i>
<i>he may havejust scared away a man...</i>

337
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:12,735
<i>who supported him in the way</i>
<i>he'd always hoped his own father would.</i>

338
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:22,481
<i>And Michael headed</i>
<i>over to the mall.</i>

339
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:26,286
- So what the hell is this?
- Hey, Dad, I didn't know
we were shoplifting, okay?

340
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:28,918
Shoplifting?
What's the matter with you, Gob?

341
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,293
What's the matter with me?
She's the shoplifter!

342
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:34,196
- I wasn't shoplifting, you twit.
- Yes, thanks to me.

343
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,632
No. I work here.

344
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:40,695
At least I used to. They fired me because
they thought I was helping this idiot shoplift.

345
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,503
Also, they said I wasn't
a very good salesgirl.

346
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,670
You can't be serious?

347
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,771
<i>A salesgirl.</i>

348
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:51,112
I knew it! I knew you
couldn't pull it off.

349
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,084
There's only one magician
in this family and that is me.

350
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:57,156
And you got caught by a 13-year-old girl.

351
00:18:57,257 --> 00:19:00,317
You know, this is why I'm constantly
asking you to stay away from my son.

352
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:02,452
Yeah, well, it's not like you were there
to spend any time with me, Dad.

353
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,496
Because I'm not daughter
enough for you.

354
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:09,227
George Michael, um,
I'm always there for you, okay?

355
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:12,270
It's just you're getting a little too manly
for Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

356
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:17,139
- Dad, that's what makes it funny.
- I also wanted to give Maeby
a good role model for a change.

357
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:20,974
Yeah, well, I guess, you looking out for
her is probably something she could use.

358
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,174
Where is Maeby?

359
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,911
<i>Michael realized he had</i>
<i>to get to the police station...</i>

360
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:30,149
<i>before they got ahold of Maeby, to whom</i>
<i>he'd promised $50 to tell the truth.</i>

361
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,281
I've put a bounty on my own head.

362
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:36,453
<i>But Maeby's instincts to lie returned.</i>

363
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:38,463
Hey, you can't go in there.

364
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:41,227
No, it's okay.
I'm Detective Fellows's daughter.

365
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:45,498
Oh. Oh, sorry. It's four-three-five.
And that opens any door in the building.

366
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,573
Great. Thanks.

367
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:57,142
<i>And it was there that Maeby</i>
<i>discovered the key to Michael's freedom.</i>

368
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,150
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

369
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,652
Maeby. What-What-What'd she say?

370
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:04,315
I said there's a tape of Kitty getting
on the boat and that you guys blew it up.

371
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:07,188
I told them the truth,
like you told me.

372
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,386
That-a-girl.

373
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:12,829
That's right. That's, uh, that's the truth.
That's everything that we know.

374
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,335
You're free to go.

375
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:21,502
Great. Here we go.

376
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:28,276
- What the hell just happened?
- Relax. They got nothing on you.

377
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:31,111
They're bluffing. Kitty's alive.
I just saw her in the back room.

378
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:34,152
They just wanted to get you scared,
so you'd testify against Pop-Pop.

379
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,312
Unbelievable. Oh, that's great.

380
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:40,051
You just told them the truth;
they let us walk.

381
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,493
- I guess I owe you 50 bucks, huh?
- Yeah. I'd save your money.

382
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:46,656
Kitty's got a lot of evidence,
and she thinks that you tried to kill her.

383
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,996
So you're probably going to
need a better attorney.

384
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,806
<i>Lo siento.</i>

385
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:58,207
I hate Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

386
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:01,041
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

387
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:05,846
<i>Tobias loses his securityjob</i>
<i>trying to solve the store's mice problem.</i>

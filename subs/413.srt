Bluth had never been</i>

00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,156
<i>- more popular.
- GEORGE MICHAEL (laughing): No.</i>

3
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,699
<i>He was surrounded by people</i>

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,285
<i>who were thrilled to be in his company.</i>

5
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:19,744
Carlos was just... tickling me.

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,454
They're almost out of root beer.

7
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,498
So I got you one with
the last bit of root beer

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,209
because I remember that
somebody was saying that, um,

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,626
George Michael likes root beer.

10
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:28,503
<i>And as his business was taking off... </i>

11
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,005
I do. Thanks a lot.

12
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,715
You guys don't have to
do all this, you know?

13
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:32,883
This was just a little
get-together for my girlfriend

14
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,759
to show her I'm doing well, you know?

15
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,094
<i>- ... so was his romantic life.
- Show her I'm an adult.</i>

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,304
Hey, stop it!

17
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:38,680
You're dead, man, you are so dead.

18
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,724
That was the last root beer snow cone.

19
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:42,142
I got that for him, Carlos.

20
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,643
Teach you for being such a kiss ass, Terry.

21
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:44,895
<i>And it was an ex-Bluth Company employee... </i>

22
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,730
TOM: Come on, you guys, not cool.

23
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,773
<i>Who was the most grateful
to be in his company.</i>

24
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,901
- Want any of these?
- No, I'm fine.

25
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,028
You know, I really appreciate
you guys doing all this.

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,155
I just wish I understood...

27
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:56,823
why.

28
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:59,159
That's why... because you could ask us

29
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,078
why we do this, and mean it.

30
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,122
The fact that you could
be so down to earth...

31
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,623
CARLOS: And look so young.

32
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,584
While you're starting this giant company.

33
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,669
You created an opportunity many of us

34
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,462
thought we'd never have again.

35
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:15,508
See that's the part I
don't understand, Carlos.

36
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,177
You know my name! What's his name?

37
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,720
- You're the kiss-ass, Carlos.
- What's his name?

38
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,138
Okay, guys, I'm gonna learn all your names.

39
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,681
- I promise.
- REBEL: George.

40
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,350
<i>- And that's when he heard what
- Rebel.</i>

41
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,560
<i>- Had become his name.
- What is all this?</i>

42
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,895
Oh, it's just a little surprise.

43
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:28,605
- You did this for me?
- Yes!

44
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,399
Well... well, they did it for me, but...

45
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,318
but only because they knew I
wanted to do something for you.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,113
Maybe we could talk without your friends.

47
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:37,614
I mean, these guys aren't
really my friends, you know.

48
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:38,823
I barely know their names. (laughs)

49
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,825
I mean, I know Carlos, but...

50
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,536
only because of that old song
"Carlos the Tickle Monster."

51
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,080
Wait, what song is that?

52
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,540
Oh, god, I knew he made that up.

53
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,418
But it did help me remember.

54
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,961
Anyway, don't worry about these
guys... they're not listening

55
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,379
to a word we're saying.

56
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:53,422
How about that kiss?

57
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,839
We need to talk.

58
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,302

that's where the song should've ended.

a little carried away.

(laughs) Now, you know if I was

76
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,556
playing in your band, I would say,

77
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,225
"Hey, you know, let's do
the whole fast and loose

79
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,436
But this is about my demo tape

80
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:50,519
to Juilliard and they've got

81
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,147
to dig what I do so much

82
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,316
that they start an entire
department for wood block.

83
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,692
So I'm sorry guys.

84
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,152
And you're leaving, okay.

85
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:58,153
They left early.

86
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,696
Proves my point.

87
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,906
She was cute.

88
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,241
They were playing way
too loud anyway, right?

89
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,284
Could you even hear the wood block?

90
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,452
Right at the end.

91
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:07,371
We could record you separately,

92
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,705
and then mix it louder on the computer.

93
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:10,207
Well, then I'm not playing in a band.

94
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,875
I mean, the whole point of the band

95
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,793
is to showcase my amazing internal clock.

96
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,586
You know, that's something
you have to be born with.

97
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,088
<i>Or bred with.</i>

98
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,216
<i>Which was the case with George Michael.</i>

99
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:22,219
<i>Who, as a small child,
appeared in a promotional video</i>

100

<i>for a developmental tool called "BabyTock"</i>

101
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,474
BabyTock! will give your
child a head start at math.

102
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:30,435
And if I were a doctor,
I would guarantee you

103
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,022
that it would also boost
their brain power 110%.

104
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:36,900
That's a lot of brain power.

105
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,277
You've been using BabyTock!, correct?

106
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,571
- For how long?
- TRACEY: For two months.

107
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,949
But George Michael really
enjoys listening to the sound.

108
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,784
And would you say it's...

109
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,037
changed the power of his brain?

110
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,331
Uh, well, that's impossible...

111
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,291
LUCILLE: To deny.

112
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,877
I've always wanted a smart baby.

113
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,962

<i>In fact it came from something that didn't.</i>

115
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:04,428
So we're stuck with 5,000 of
these worthless corn-ballers?

recoup some of their costs</i>

119
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,103
Whoa, whoa.

120
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,854
They're not worthless.

121
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,773
You know? The timer still works.

122
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:19,359
There's no numbers on it,
but it's very loud, so...

123
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:22,695
Perfect for those who
like the sound of a clock,

124
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,072
but don't know their numbers.

125
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,407
That's good.

126
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,534
We'll sell this to baby... (yells)

Mother of (bleep)!

128
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,704
We should put these in cribs.

129
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,623

Music, yes

135

You know, he still thinks of
me as the same George Michael

136

that I was before my life

137
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,261
blew apart, you know?

138
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,971
Before the world cracked me open

139
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,223

00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,806
<i>without his possessions,</i>

178
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:16,976
<i>he was finally at a place where he felt</i>

179
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:18,936
<i>- he'd fit in.
- (Metallic screeching)</i>

180
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,063
MAN: Hey, hey, check it out.

181
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:21,856
(onlookers laughing)

182
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,733
(truck door closes)

183
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,905
(George Michael laughing)

184
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,074
N... no.

185
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:32,741
No, no.

186
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:35,495
(laughs): What?

187
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,124
<i>In his Freshman year, George Michael</i>

188
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,086
<i>- hit the ground running.
- Sorry.</i>

189
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,795
<i>He was breaking some of the old taboos.</i>

190
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,465
<i>- Let's make it a... Pepsi.
- Drinking Pepsi in the morning.</i>

191
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,301
So, it's a breakfast combo with a Pepsi.

192
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,469
<i>Sometimes having eggs at night.</i>

193
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,555
How about some eggs?

194
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,348
Oh, excuse me, I forgot it wasn't morning.

195
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,475
<i>He was soon finding that others
enjoyed his sense of humor.</i>

196
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,686
(laughing): I forgot it wasn't morning.

197
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,479
<i>A present from his Uncle Gob elevated</i>

198
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,106
<i>- his newfound confidence.
- Hi.</i>

199
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,358
My uncle is a magician.

200
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,068
<i>Before diminishing it.</i>

201
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,614
<i>But before he knew it</i>

202
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,657
<i>sophomore year was upon him,</i>

203
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,326
<i>- and everything got turned up to 11.
- Boom!</i>

204
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,705
And that's what we call
only being behind by three.

205
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,457
So then that stuff's all going
on with this Sitwell company.

206
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:23,501
And then... we end up playing
them in a softball game.

207
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,045
<i>Highlights... loyal friends.</i>

208
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:27,672
I'm like, "How can that... ?"

209
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,549
<i>Romance.</i>

210
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,675
(muffled): Becky.

211
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,176
<i>Betrayal.</i>

212
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,762
Becky?

213
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,096
What's up, Ray?

214
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,473
You guys broke up.

215
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,392
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

216
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,687
<i>The triumph of friendship.</i>

217
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,854
- What's up, Ray?
- Hey.

218
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,149
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

219
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,776
You know who I was thinking
about before you sat down?

220
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,068
- What?
- Becky.

221
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,445
Do you remember?

222
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,863
<i>And as surely as stability returned,</i>

223
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,493
<i>junior year ushered in a
new era of experimentation... </i>

224
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:57,994
It's all about the science of kissing

225
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,537
between a man and a woman.

226
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,122
That always has fascinated me.

227
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh, good. Sheila will take you.

228
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,041
<i>As George Michael tried to compensate</i>

229
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,544
<i>for the lack of income from his father</i>

230
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,339
<i>by volunteering for experiments.</i>

231
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,257
Hi.

232
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:15,094
So I don't run off?

233
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,472
- I hope you're not feeling too awkward.
- Oh, don't be crazy.

234
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,057
- Okay.
- Now when the mouth
to mouth test begins,

235
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,269
I'm gonna be yelling out letters
that indicate mouth movements.

236
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,813
What I need you to do is just give me

237
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,481
on a scale of one to
ten your pleasure level.

238
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,775
- Fine.
- Ten being the most
pleasurable, one the least.

239
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,610
Let's hope we get to ten.

240
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:33,488
- Well, work our way up to it.
- Bringing in the mouth unit!

241
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,824
<i>And that's when he realized
what the straps were for.</i>

242
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,202
Is that... ? Okay, I guess it's
not, uh, not gonna be a person.

243
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:41,162
- And C?
- I think one on C.

244
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,331
- M? M?
- Oh, one on...

245
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,875
- M?
- One for sure on... one.

246
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,210
- And Z?
- One.

247
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,336
- N?
- One.

248
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,171
- F? F?
- One. One.

249
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,632
<i>But it wasn't until his year abroad</i>

250
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:55,051
<i>that George Michael got
an education in life.</i>

251
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:01,224
<i>Because after a year of trying
not to be an imposing guest</i>

252
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,684
<i>in his new country,</i>

253
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,602
<i>he was ready</i>

254
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,272
<i>for a summer that would end up
turning his life upside down... </i>

255
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,400
(both yelling in Spanish)

256
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,530
<i>when the woman whose
children he was nannying... </i>

257
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,199

258
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,034
<i>opened him up sexually.</i>

259
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,495
Hey, hey, did Ernesto get his 4:00?

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,248
The drones are coming.

261
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,999
Nothing matters now.

262
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,007
- Why do you kiss like this?
- Like what?

263
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,260
The teeth, they must not be used like this.

264
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,136
<i>It was actually a jaw and lip</i>

265
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,431
<i>retraction issue, but
she had neither a command</i>

00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:44,601
<i>of the language nor the data that we do.</i>

267
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,061
You make love like a boy.

268
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,563
Spanish, speak to me in Spanish.

269
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,481
Because the only way that college credit is

270
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,733
actually activated is if I have...

271
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,360
<i>- Dominarme.
- Cook... cook at... </i>

272
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:55,986
- Cooking at you?
- Overpower me.

273
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,072
Oh, yes, make me cry.

274
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,449
You're a terrible mother.

275
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,284
(high-pitched crying)

276
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,661
<i>And so it was a very
different George Michael</i>

277
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,330
<i>that returned to school for senior year.</i>

278
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,250
<i>Eager to unleash his new</i>

279
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,545
<i>overt sexuality on an unsuspecting campus.</i>

280
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,922
(laughs) Hey, man.

281
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,715
It gets better.

282
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:16,883
(people laughing)

283
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,342
<i>And for George Michael,</i>

284
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,720
<i>senior year did get better.</i>

285
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:22,680
<i>- He was like a king
- I sort of feel like a king</i>

286
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,933
<i>- returning to his castle...
- Returning to his castle.</i>

287
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,810
<i>Only to discover that they thought</i>

288
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,436
<i>he was two kings.</i>

289
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:29,938
Welcome to your castle.

290
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,899
<i>And they had doubled
the size of his castle.</i>

291
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,233
Double castle.

292
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,110
BOTH: Can't wait to meet Michael, George.

293
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:38,195
<i>It would be the perfect backdrop</i>

294
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,698
<i>to unveil George Michael 2.0.</i>

295
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,325
<i>GEORGE MICHAEL: Todo mio.</i>

296
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:45,286
<i>Todo mia?</i>

297
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,413
<i>Mio.</i>

298
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,169
<i>- (knocking)
- But George Michael's
development was about</i>

299
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,712
<i>- to be forestalled.
- Hey.</i>

300
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,256
- Dad.
- Pete died.

301
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,592
Oh, God.

302
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:02,052
- Uh, who's, uh, Pete?
- Don't worry about it.

303
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,805
Don't you worry about it.

304
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,097
I like this.

305
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,641
- I like the mustache.
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,643
- Oh... it's kind of fun.
- That's great.

307
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:09,936
Probably gonna want to shave it off

308
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:11,604
before the start of next quarter.

309
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:13,147
Otherwise, they're gonna
think you're a musician, huh?

310
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,274
But I love it... dude.

311
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,068
GEORGE MICHAEL: I'm never going to be

312
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,445
louder than an electric guitar.

313
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:20,780
Maybe using a band to showcase

314
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,532
my wood block skill is a dumb idea.

315
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,158
P-HOUND: Too bad there's no such thing

316
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,869
as an electric wood block.

317
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,663
GEORGE MICHAEL: That sounds
like a mother of an invention.

318
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,665
<i>NARRATOR: And so they set to work</i>

319
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,542
<i>inventing a downloadable app</i>

320
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,627
<i>that would allow one to
play an electronic version</i>

321
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,462
<i>of a wood block on their smartphone.</i>

322
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:38,339
You see, that's important.

323
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,757
Well, that's what it is.

324
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,384
So it's basically like you'll always

325
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:42,760
have a wood block with you.

326
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,722
I can't believe nobody's ever done this.

327
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,140
<i>A quick something search
would have shown the guys</i>

328
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:51,895
<i>that there were already three
wood block apps on the market.</i>

329
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,813
So, there are three on the market.

330
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,606
<i>Which they did.</i>

331
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,316
(George Michael speaking Spanish)

332
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:58,860
<i>But even after doing that search,</i>

333
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,277
<i>they were undeterred.</i>

334
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,572
Download them. Come on, let's do it.

335
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:04,657
I hope we're not doing this on my account.

336
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,325
No, we're doing it so that we can see

337
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,618
what the competition is like.

338
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,662
No, I mean on my iTunes account.

339
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,039
It's 99 cents.

340
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,498
Yeah, times three.

341
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,291
<i>And soon, they realized</i>

342
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,461
<i>what kind of competition
they were up against.</i>

343
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,800
Well, these are a (bleep) joke.

344
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,552
- (laughing): I know.
- Where are the mallet options?

345
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:27,095
There's no choice of
wood weight or grain type.

346
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,806
There's no diameter hole option.

347
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,433
I mean, what is this, BabyTock?

348
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,768
- BabyTock?
- You know, the sharp

349
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,561
metal box that you put in the crib.

350
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:35,271
Is that not a well-known... ?

351
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,105
<i>- But this is fine.
- And they set to work.</i>

352
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,482
No, I understand that. I get that.

353
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,526
But it just seems like
you're leaving a hole

354
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:41,819
just right in the middle of the block.

355
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,821
It won't be a block on anything 3G.

356
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,990
<i>Although some of the work had
to happen outside the room.</i>

357
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,825
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

358
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,159
<i>Which was challenging.</i>

359
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,663
<i>And soon, they were
close to finishing an app</i>

360
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,082
<i>they had decided to call... </i>

361
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:55,750
Woodblock.

362
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,334
It's taken.

363
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,170
Blockwood.

364
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,465
It's taken.

365
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,008
<i>And that's when he came up with... </i>

366
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,217
Block of Wood?

367
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,636
<i>- Which was also taken.
- Wow.</i>

368
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:08,512
- Block-block?
- No.

369
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,222
People are going to think we're
in the chicken-noise business.

370
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:11,641
How is that a chicken noise?

371
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,142
You know... well, it's kind of hard to do

372
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:17,105
in these matador pants, but, you know...

373
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:19,649
- Block-bl...
- (over phone): Fakeblock is available.

374
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,900
Do you want Fakeblock?

375
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,693
Oh, uh, okay. They have Fakeblock.

376
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,320
Okay, yes, we'll take that.

377
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:26,447
No problem. That's no problem.

378
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,365
Could you hang on to that for me, please?

379
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,868
And I'll call you back. Thank you.

380
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,370
It's $5,000 for the domain name,

381
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,332
and then there's this
whole XML Web site fee.

382
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,583
I got the last one.

383
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,376
That was 99 cents.

384
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,711
Times three.

385
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,421
<i>And George Michael realized</i>

386
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:44,007
<i>he needed to bring in some cash.</i>

387
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,508
We actually have a variety of subjects

388
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,384
that high school students need tutoring in.

389
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,970
If you want to just
take a look at that list

390
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:50,680
and let me know if there's anything there

391
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,598
<i>- that you've handled before.
- There was... </i>

392
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,058
<i>although George Michael</i>

393
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,977
<i>couldn't imagine it was the same Maeby.</i>

394
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,980
Is this "F" in "Maeby F."
her last name or her grade?

395
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,773
Oh, it's her last name.

396
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:02,232
But her most recent grade is...

397
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,029
well, this just shows
an Elvis Presley head.

398
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:08,823
So, that bad?

399
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,324
I'll take her.

400
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,993
Stay on top of her.

401
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:14,286
You may need to ride her pretty hard.

402
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:16,497
Hey, you must be...

403
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,290
What?

404
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,501
- This is the girl you broke up with?
- Huh?

405
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,545
What is this? (whispers):
I can't wear this.

406
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:24,296
Yeah, well, we dated for
a while, but, you know,

407
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,673
I was a kid, and I didn't know

408
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,675
how to kiss yet. I don't know,

409
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:29,093
for whatever reason, I listened to my dad

410
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,511
who said we shouldn't make it work.

411
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,513
- Was she your first?
- Cousin? No.

412
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,974
Why would you... why would
your mind go right to... ? No.

413
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:36,934
No, it's just that he was right.

414
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,978
We were kids. I wasn't yet O.S.

415
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,312
<i>- Overtly sexual.
- Overtly sexual.</i>

416
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,439
Right. As I live and breathe. Crazy.

417
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,400
- That's just crazy.
- (Knock on door)

418
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,985
Okay, so listen.

419
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,487
After I let her in, you go
and try and keep my dad out.

420
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,948
All right? I can't let him
get in the way of this one.

421
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,075
Hey, you must be...

422
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:53,283
<i>But first, he had to cover his tracks.</i>

423
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,161
<i>- What?
- This had to look like fate.</i>

424
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,704
- George Michael?
- Huh?

425
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,831
What is this? Maeby, what are you...

426
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:01,209
doing here?

427
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,335
<i>- As I live and breathe.
- But for the phrase, "as I live</i>

428
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,088
<i>- I thought you were the girl.
- And breathe," he nailed it.</i>

429
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,756
I'm supposed to tutor a kid from...

430
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,383
High school. Yeah. That's me.

431
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,427
Crazy. That is just crazy.

432
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,387
<i>And even though George
Michael wanted to seduce her,</i>

433
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,305
<i>he couldn't helpbut challenge</i>

434
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,891
<i>her strategy for staying in high school.</i>

435
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,643
But still, I mean, you have
to make a living, right?

436
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,062
Don't you need an education?

437
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,522
Well, don't forget... I'm a Harris.

438
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,566
- Harris?
- Yeah.

439
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,735
Someone who "inharris" a lot of money.

440
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,153
Yeah, well, you know,

441
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,405
I wouldn't put all my Anns in that basket.

442
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,490
You know, it's fine. You don't get it.

443
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,159
You've never been a risk taker.

444
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,535
I like to (bleep) with people.

445
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,037
That's what I do.

446
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,748
- I'm making a statement.
- P-HOUND: I love it.

447
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,916
MAEBY: You know, I knew you were cool

448
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,126
when I saw you wearing that shirt.

449
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,002
Thanks.

450
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,212
<i>More betrayal.</i>

451
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:47,463
Oh, no, I get it, too.

452
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,132
No, I love... I love it, too.

453
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:53,302
You know, I... I love to... love now.

454
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,512
<i>George Michael found himself</i>

455
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,556
<i>less overtly sexual than he'd hoped.</i>

456
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,850
I made a 40-year-old woman cry in Spain.

457
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,228
P-HOUND: I love making
love to Spanish women.

458
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,980
Get out.

459
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,482
<i>And George Michael slipped
back into seduction mode.</i>

460
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:10,278
Oh, a man, a woman...

461
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,779
a bedroom.

462
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,741
Let's solve for "X."

463
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,035
I don't know what you're talking about.

464
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,871
Well, you know, in algebra,
you have an unknown element,

465
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,082
and, uh, we call it "X," and then you have

466
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,335
to solve for it to find
out what number "X" is.

467
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,587
"X" isn't a number.

468
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,631
So you don't even really know the basic...

469
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,591
<i>But in that moment, the urge to educate her</i>

470
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,551
<i>was more powerful than
the urge to kiss her.</i>

471
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,263
Let me show you. I'll just
show you some stuff real quick.

472
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:40,474
All right, so if you take
something like this... 3X+1=10...

473
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,226
<i>And with the algebra lesson complete,</i>

474
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,811
<i>George Michael pivoted back</i>

475
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,855
<i>to his overtly sexual seduction.</i>

476
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,982
Therefore, when I say,

477
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:52,402
"You and me in a bedroom,
let's solve for 'X, '" I'm...

478
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,072
I'm stating it as a kind of formula.

479
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,490
Yeah, let's get wasted.

480
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,575
Let's drink that formula.

481
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,494
(chuckling): It's not that kind of formula.

482
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,454
No, I'll show you what
a formula is real quick,

483
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,040
- 'cause that's very important.
- (Door opens)

484
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,916
<i>- But when the door opened,
- Dad?</i>

485
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,711
<i>George Michael's window
of opportunity closed.</i>

486
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:11,130
Bad news... P-Hound is
yanking our chain again.

487
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:12,798
- MAEBY: Uncle Michael.
- MICHAEL: Oh, my God.

488
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,634
<i>And after a brief
reunion, George Michael had</i>

489
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:18,054
<i>another opportunity to impress his cousin.</i>

490
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:20,430
He's got this privacy software,

491
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,683
keeps people from stealing
your stuff. Tell her, pal.

492
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,769
So its privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

493
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,647
<i>George Michael weighed his options.</i>

494
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,859
<i>Maeby had chastised him
for not taking risks,</i>

495
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:33,944
<i>and what would be a bigger risk</i>

496
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,779
<i>than perpetuating a lie about software</i>

497
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,615
<i>just to ignite the passions of a woman?</i>

498
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,951
<i>Of course, it would be a lie,</i>

499
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,246
<i>and since Maeby wouldn't know it was a lie,</i>

500
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,748
<i>he wouldn't appear to be taking a risk.</i>

501
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:48,042
<i>Perhaps the bigger risk
was to tell his father</i>

502
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,418
<i>he was lying.</i>

503
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,878
<i>That he came up with it</i>

504
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,880
<i>because he wanted his father to leave</i>

505
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:55,674
<i>so he could enjoy what
remained of his senior year.</i>

506
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:58,094
<i>After all, he wondered, wouldn't that be</i>

507
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:01,264
<i>the course of action taken
by an overtly sexual man... </i>

508
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,016
<i>a man who owns a pair of matador pants?</i>

509
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:07,937
<i>He had not responded now for 41 seconds,</i>

510
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:10,273
<i>according to his unfailing internal clock,</i>

511
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:13,109
<i>and it was time to come clean.</i>

512
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,568
Well, thanks. Yeah.

513
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,445
It's a... well, it's just a Boolean-driven

514
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:20,490
aggregation, really, of what
programmers call "hacker traps."

515
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,493
<i>And he found himself
suddenly and effortlessly</i>

516
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,414
<i>tapping into a long-inbred
instinct for lying.</i>

517
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,750
<i>A Bluth taking his first steps in deceit.</i>

518
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,794
<i>But the more he talked,</i>

519
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,670
<i>the more he actually
started to like the idea.</i>

520
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,423
So, you know, in other words, when...

521
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,300
when you have friends over,
you know, and you're...

522
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:38,926
you're listening to music and they want

523
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,387
to steal your music and
copy your movies or...

524
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,931
or just look at your photos,
you know, this prevents that.

525
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:47,684
It just neutralizes that so
it's not even a threat anymore.

526
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,728
It's called Fakeblock.

527
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,688
- Great name. Right?
- Yeah, well, you know,

528
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,065
it's super low-hanging fruit.

529
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,566
Someone's going to do it.

530
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,693
We're just trying to
be those guys, you know?

531
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,196
<i>And, impressed with his</i>

532
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,157
<i>- own invention...
- It's a fake profile</i>

533
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,908
that leads hackers away
from your actual data.

534
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,701
<i>He set about making an
impossible dream a reality.</i>

535
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,953
You mean something that keeps

536
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,371
everything on the Internet private

537
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,831
and protects everyone's digital rights?

538
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,124
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

539
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,459
Everyone has something

540
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,377
that they want removed from the Internet.

541
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,212
<i>George Michael certainly did.</i>

542
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,881
<i>And if the new software served</i>

543
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,967
<i>no other person than removing this... </i>

544
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,054
<i>it would be worth it.</i>

545
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,056
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

546
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,433
I mean, if we could
make something like that,

547
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:29,018
it could be bigger than Facebook.

548
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,727
I mean, who wouldn't
want something like that?

549
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,979
You think you can do it?

550
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,605
No.

551
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:36,108
No, of course not. No.

552
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,985
I mean, this is my chance with Maeby,

553
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,903
and I can't even get rid of my own father.

554
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,572
You know, what if we just did
a vote... just the roommates?

555
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,741
We do a quick vote, and
it's, "Ciao, Fathero."

556
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,036
He's going to know who voted against him.

557
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:50,706
Not if I get him to vote against himself.

558
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,042
Why would he do that?

559
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,502
No, he wouldn't. He... I...

560
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,128
I was just leaning back,
so it looked like I...

561
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,629
I got this chair again, didn't I?

562
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,174
Maybe I just need to be clear and just say,

563
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,717
"I'm putting up a wall.

564
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,053
We need to rework our whole system here."

565
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,722
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

566
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,558
<i>And, long story short, Michael did end up</i>

567
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,436
<i>embracing the
voting-out-a-roommate idea.</i>

568
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,063
And it's, "Adios, brothiero."

569
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:15,481
It cannot fail.

570
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,570
That was fun.

571
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:22,905
Did he look betrayed to you?

572
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,407
He kind of always looks that way.

573
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:27,326
I'm going to catch the bus.

574
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,286
- Bye.
- Well, uh, okay. Hey, listen.

575
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,080
Are you going to come by on Thursday or... ?

576
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:34,124
Um, I don't think so. I
have this thing in L.A.

577
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,751
Well, can you blow it off? I
mean, you know, you might want

578
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,503
to get "graduating high
school" out of the way.

579
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:40,423
Well, I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award at this gala.

580
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:43,509
Well, you might want to get that
out of the way, too, I guess.

581
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,927
Yeah.

582
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,678
Hey, you want me to go
with you to that or... ?

583
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,597
Yeah, I can pick you up at your place.

584
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,183
Oh, they're actually
shooting a thing at my place.

585
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,102
<i>As it turns out, they'd end up</i>

586
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,686
<i>- just clubbing a Thing.
- Oh!</i>

587
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,106
You know what? Yeah, that
might actually be a good idea.

588
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:59,066
Because I can't bring
any of my friends without

589
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,484
getting permission
slips from their parents.

590
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,652
Well, that's not really a problem for me.

591
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,030
Yeah, 'cause you just
betrayed yours, right?

592
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:06,949
MAEBY (chuckling): Awesome.

593
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:12,162
<i>George Michael and Maeby arrived</i>

594
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,249
<i>at a hotel busy with three separate events.</i>

595
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,584
(people laughing)

596
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,086
GEORGE MICHAEL (laughing): No, no, no...

597
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,172
Well, it's really nice to be
out with you as adults, you know?

598
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,592
In Spain, they don't even eat
dinner until after 11: 00 p.m.

599
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,594
Wow, Spain really changed you.

600
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,053
Well, you grow up very quickly in Spain.

601
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:29,721
Oh, my God, I know this guy. Hey.

602
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,014
Hey, man. Hey.

603
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,100
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

604
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,562
What are you on?

605
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,773
Oh, he's nobody.

606
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,609
Oh. It's Justin.

607
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,152
That's David Henrie.

608
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,820
<i>He's Justin from Wizards of Waverly Place.</i>

609
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,071
Hmm.

610
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,365
It's on a lot in Spain.

611
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,242
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

612
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,535
who think they can still play fifth grade.

613
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,911
- Have fun.
- I'll catch up.

614
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:54,455
<i>And George Michael set out</i>

615
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:56,873
<i>to re-unleash his overtly sexual persona.</i>

616
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,793
Well, gentlemen, start your engines.

617
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:01,962
<i>Buenas noches, pequeño Scarlet.</i>

618
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,255
I will be needing a room, please.

619
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:04,965
How many nights?

620
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,425
Two. Sorry. No, just one night.

621
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,552
I thought you were saying how many people.

622
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,929
- And how many beds?
- Two.

623
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,140
- Two.
- No. Uh, one bed.

624
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:14,975
Why give her the option?
Keep it real simple.

625
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,978
One bed, one night, two people,
let's solve for "X." (laughs)

626
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,022
I hate young Hollywood.

627
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:22,483
MAEBY: It's called Fakeblock, Mort.

628
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:24,876
<i>- It's going to blow Schnoodle out of the water!
- And it was on his way back</i>

629
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,487
- to Maeby that he heard her say...
- Fakeblock's the next big thing.

630
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,657
- It's called Fakeblock!
- What's this? You're talking... talking about Fakeblock?

631
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:32,117
-Oh. How does your privacy software work?
- Huh? It's private.

632
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,627
<i>And that's how George
Michael not only met Rebel... </i>

633
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:37,421
I don't want people to
know that I'm doing this.

634
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:38,838
<i>But finally found a way to prove</i>

635
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,425
<i>to Maeby that he was a risk taker.</i>

636
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,010
Yes. Yes. George Maharis.

637
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,555
<i>Only to discover, moments later... </i>

638
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:47,765
<i>- Perfecto!
- ... that she was dating</i>

639
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:50,726
<i>- an even bigger risk taker.
- De nada.</i>

640
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,978
That's my undercover cop boyfriend.

641
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,396
I'm trying to get him in bed.

642
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:55,813
Boyfriend?

643
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:59,359
So funny that didn't come up in the car.

644
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:01,528
So, how does it work?

645
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,863
Huh? How does what work?

646
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,658
Your privacy software.

647
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:08,285
How does it protect you from piracy?

648
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:09,953
Oh, I don't know.

649
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:12,247
Don't worry about it.

650
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,167
No, no, no. No, you
really piqued my interest.

651
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,628
I'm sorry.

652
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,172
<i>And discouraged that he'd lost Maeby,</i>

<i>by taking a picture of Gibby from "iCarly."</i>

655
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,096
<i>As he was doing this,

656
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:30,516
(loud explosion, people screaming)

657
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:33,185
<i>The explosion caused an electrical surge</i>

00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:35,646
<i>rendering the Schnoodle
software inoperable.</i>

659
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:38,357
<i>Which, to those who saw him,</i>

660
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:40,651
<i>seemed like a genius act of cyber sabotage,</i>

661
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,944
<i>which led to this.</i>

662
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,823
- What happened?
- Ah, it's dead.

663
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:48,325
That geek Maharis
destroyed the whole thing.

664
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,994
And you know why? Just because he could.

665
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:53,871
Those Internet geniuses...
that's what they do. I'm ruined.

666
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,166
I'll probably never get
to drive the Schnoodle car.

667
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,001
We should work together.

668
00:23:58,043 --> 00:23:59,628
- No.
- Smart.

669
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,257
<i>And a few days later,

I'm John Beard. Here's
your 15 seconds of news.

671
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:08,178
Fakeblock's mystery man, George Maharis,

672
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,430
may have just found a way to screw a cap

673
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:13,183
on the Internet, and
investors are lining up

674
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:14,810
to fill the company's tank with money,

675
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,478
even though he himself remains anonymous.

676
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,314
That's all the news
that's fit to pump. I quit.

<i>even his roommate had heard

This George Maharis guy stole our name,

No, I am George Maharis!

684
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,204
I'm behind the whole thing.

685
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:35,748
I... I wanted to impress Maeby,

686
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,999
so I told her that I created
this privacy software.

687
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,668
Why would you do that?

688
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,378
You know, it's like the
time that you told that girl

689
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,088
that you were George Takei's son.

690
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:45,716
Well, it's too late.
This thing's taking off.

691
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,677
They're saying Fakeblock
knocked out Schnoodle.

692
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,512
That was a coincidence. It
must have been a power surge.

693
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:52,681
Well, we got to get something... at least

694
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:54,307
get our five grand back.

695
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:56,059
Well, I put in the five grand,
you put in three dollars.

696
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:58,061
Well, you may have put in
the most money to Fakeblock,

697
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:59,813
but I put in the first three dollars,

698
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,273
so that makes you a hop-on.

699
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,982
No, you're the hop-on, Paul,

700
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:05,569
and I know exactly who
you're trying to hop on to.

701
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:07,195
- Maeby.
- Maeby.

702
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:10,741
Yeah, well, you know
she's dating a cop, right?

703
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:12,242
- Yeah, she likes risk takers, like the P...
-MAEBY: Hi.

704
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,869
Hound...

705
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:16,121
Keep moving. Can you believe this?

706
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:18,039
<i>- Maeby was excited...
- Fakeblock! It's exploding!</i>

707
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,875
<i>- ... but George Michael knew
- I got my PR company fanning it</i>

708
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,334
<i>the stakes were too high
for him to continue the lie.</i>

709
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:22,502
And I even cashed in a favor

710
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:23,629
to get us mentioned on "Mad Money."

711
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,046
You know, I think we just might want

712
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,132
to slow down a little bit
on the whole Fakeblock thing

713
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,092
'cause I'm still not 100% finished with it.

714
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,469
Well, how finished are you with it?

715
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,721
200%? 500%

716
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,264
I also feel like I'm not 100% finished

717
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:35,933
<i>- with your math tutoring.
- And then Maeby said something</i>

718
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:39,853
<i>- that made his change his mind.
- Do we have those books here?</i>

719
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:41,396
MAEBY: I trust you, George Michael.

720
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,481
I would not get into bed with you

721
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:43,941
on this thing if I didn't trust you.

722
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:47,193
No. Yeah, of... of course
you can trust me in bed.

723
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,946
No, I mean, I trust you
not to take advantage of me.

724
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:52,407
No. I wouldn't. We would...
we would just lie there.

725
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:55,076
We'd just lie there? I mean,
I'm talking about business.

726
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:58,497
So am I. That's why we
would just lie there.

727
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,624
Okay. (laughs) 'Cause I was going to say,

728
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,083
when you become an Internet billionaire,

729
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,544
you could do whatever
you want with me in bed.

730
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:06,588
<i>It was that. That's what
made him change his mind.</i>

731
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,882
<i>- I will. I will.
- And if it was so wrong to lie,</i>

732
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:11,134
<i>surely he would receive some sort of sign.</i>

733
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:12,970
Oh, hey, I should get this.

734
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,263
<i>- But that wasn't it.
- Hi, Uncle Gob.</i>

735
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,682
<i>That was his uncle Gob wanting
to meet him at a gay club</i>

736
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:18,266
<i>- to tell him his father
- I need to see you tonight.</i>

737
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:20,602
<i>- Was anxious to see him.
- It's about your father and you.</i>

738
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,061
Really? Is... is he upset?

739
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:24,773
- GOB: Do I seem like a clown to you?
- I got it.

740
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,358
<i>George Michael was
worried, and even more so,</i>

741
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:28,610
<i>when he caught up with
his uncle at a magic club.</i>

742
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,362
That Fakeblock thing will scrub it away.

743
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:31,989
You know about Fakeblock?
You know that's my software.

744
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,407
I wonder if my dad
thinks I'm blowing him off

745
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:36,493
because that's starting to take off now.

746
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,411
Well, you should go
find out 'cause I do know

747
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,706
that your dad is really,
really, really upset with you.

748
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:42,499
He is upset? I asked you that.

749
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,668
That was literally the
first thing I asked you.

750
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,712
So you're giving me these crazy...

751
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:48,171
Mad?

752
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,215
<i>So, it was a very shaken George Michael</i>

753
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:52,801
<i>who arrived later at the Ealing Club... </i>

754
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:54,344
What do you mean, I'm already
up there? Obviously, I'm not...

755
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,095
<i>as a frustrated Andy
Richter was having trouble</i>

756
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:57,806
already up there because I'm here.

757
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:59,349
<i>Getting into the club he was a member of.</i>

758
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:01,768
It's my stupid brother!
He looks just like me.

759
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,396
I'll just go up, I'll find
him, I'll... Oh, come on.

760
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:05,731
Oh, hey, Donny!

761
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,106
Hey, I had you for a semester at Openings.

762
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:08,525
Yeah, okay, all right.

763
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,235
Hey, come. I'm... I'm his guest.

764
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,695
Is this man your guest?

765
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,488
Oh, no, no. I'm just meeting my dad here.

766
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,907
Oh, screw this. I'm going up.

767
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,533
- Oh, come on.
- Going up, going up.

768
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,493
Oh, come on!

769
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:20,286
Oh, some Openings child you are, man!

770
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:22,831
<i>And George Michael girded himself</i>

771
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:25,417
<i>for his first meeting with his father</i>

772
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,335
<i>since he voted him out of the dorm.</i>

773
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:28,962
Hi. Yeah, just a sea-breeze, please.

774
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:30,589
Make it a strong one.

775
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,007
Put some stank on that.

776
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,508
George?

777
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,510
George Maharis?

778
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,345
<i>And that's when he heard</i>

779
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:40,807
<i>the name he'd forgotten
he'd given out as his own.</i>

780
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,351
<i>So he tried not to act surprised to hear it</i>

781
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:44,770
<i>when he saw it was Rebel.</i>

782
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,187
I see you.

783
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,023
<i>Unfortunately, that meant being stuck</i>

784
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,608
<i>affecting a blasé attitude.</i>

785
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,150
Rebel Alley?

786
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,485
We spoke three days ago.

787
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,529
I know, I know. I remember.

788
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,949
- Are you a member here?
- No, I'm not.

789
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,034
No, I just walked in past
the big black security guard.

790
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,493
<i>All of which now worked against him.</i>

791
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,203
Okay, you know what?

792
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,039
I was trying to be nice,
but you're just a jerk.

793
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,541
You're a bigger jerk than
Andy Richter over there!

794
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,960
ANDY: Loosen up, bitch.

795
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,502
I'm Andy Richter!

796
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:13,298
I probably make, like,
$8,000 a day or something.

797
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:15,467
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry. I... I...

798
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:17,928
You know, I'm in the
middle of a whole thing

799
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,846
with my dad right now, and I, um...

800
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:22,808
I didn't mean to be...
however I just came off.

801
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:23,976
Badly.

802
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:25,435
Well, I'm sorry, you know.

803
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,520
I've never met a beautiful actress before.

804
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:28,772
Oh, so you do know who I am?

805
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:30,356
God, of course I know who you are!

806
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,358
You were in the remake
of "Dangerous Cousins."

807
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,444
I signed up to Netflix
because of that movie.

808
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,071
Uh-huh.

809
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,406
I think I was thrown that you
were interested in who I am.

810
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:39,992
Well, you are George Maharis.

811
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,243
- Everyone's talking about your software company.
- Oh, yeah.

812
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:45,914
I'm sure women are just
throwing themselves at your feet.

813
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:49,417
Well, you know, I, uh... I
prefer a woman who aims higher.

814
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:52,004
(Rebel laughs loudly,
George Michael laughs)

815
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,756
- That was funny.
- Yeah, I know.

816
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,091
- That was good. That was...
- Smooth.

817
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,384
Smooth. Hey, we have
the same taste in words.

818
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:00,804
Okay, should we get a drink? I'm buying.

819
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:03,598
I don't want you to think
I'm after you for your money.

820
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,058
<i>George Michael was
thrown by what was clearly</i>

821
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,309
<i>Rebel's stated interest in him.</i>

822
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:07,853
MAN: George Michael? George Michael?

823
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,312
<i>Which is perhaps why he ignored the page... </i>

824
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,772
<i>- MAN: George Michael?
- ... that he assumed</i>

825
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,816
- was from his father.
- George Michael?

826
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:16,319
Is George Michael here?
Is George Michael here?

827
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,779
(laughing): Oh, God.

828
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,156
Just remind me not to go in the men's room!

829
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:21,491
(laughter)

830
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:22,742
Uh, would you excuse me?

831
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:24,327
I... I'm just gonna use the men's room.

832
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:26,454
<i>- Okay.
- And while checking</i>

833
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,123
<i>his messages, he got some good news.</i>

834
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:30,458
MICHAEL: Hey, buddy,
it's Dad. Um, I am having

835
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,085
real trouble getting up there.

836
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,379
Uh, this traffic is unbelievable.

837
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,674
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

838
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:40,177
Call me back when you get this?

839
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:43,596
<i>But while Michael was
leaving a second message,</i>

840
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:44,973
<i>George Michael left one for him.</i>

841
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,225
- (phone chimes)
- Oh. Hey, hang on. This is you.

842
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,144
Hey, it's me. You know what?

843
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:51,646
I bet we're sitting in the exact
same traffic; this is a mess.

844
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,398
<i>Now hoping to ensure</i>

845
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,150
<i>that his father didn't
make it to their meeting.</i>

846
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,735
Maybe that's better. Oh,
God, they're forcing us off.

847
00:29:56,776 --> 00:29:58,195
Oh, God, they're forcing us off,

848
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,696
but you know, we can
just do this another time

849
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:02,032
if that works. Maybe that's better.

850
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:04,659
Oh, they're closing the
lanes. Oh, this is beautiful.

851
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,954
Same traffic. Unreal.

852
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:10,082
Unreal. Kind of looking around for you now.

853
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:12,042
Maybe you're right near me.

854
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:13,626
Anyhow, if you get this,

855
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:17,380
maybe we will just meet... somewhere else.

856
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:18,965
Gonna hang up now.

857
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,134
I'm going to video this
and send it in to the news.

858
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,802
Glad you're getting some footage of this,

859
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:24,554
'cause I can't really
get a good angle myself.

860
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:26,890
They're forcing us off here
like a bunch of animals.

861
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:28,975
You know, maybe we'll do this
another time, 'cause this is...

862
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:30,852
It's sad to say, but it's left me...

863
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:32,437
animals. You know maybe
we'll do this another time.

864
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:33,772
It's sad to say,

865
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,190
but it's left me pretty shaken up.

866
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:37,525
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

867
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,318
'Cause, you know, they don't
have any choice in the matter.

868
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,362
- (phone chimes)
- Well, I'll tell you what.

869
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,948
I feel worse for the parents, okay?

870
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,449
Probably the kids thought

871
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,492
that they could fly the
plane all by themselves.

872
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:49,704
Bet you 500 bucks they find
a dead kid behind the stick.

873
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:52,624
You know, or maybe on the dead dad's lap

874
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:54,960
whose only fault was
loving that kid too much

875
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,419
and letting him fly the plane.

876
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,337
Next thing he knows,
he's bouncing of the top

877
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,339
of the Sports Chalet onto
the express lane of the 605.

878
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,217
<i>- I'll bet you 500 bucks.
- Michael was hurt</i>

879
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,511
<i>- and on his way out...
- See you. I'm out of your hair.</i>

880
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:07,346
<i>When he heard something
that cheered him up.</i>

881
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:09,307
The guy that was harassing
Rebel... he's on his way down.

882
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:10,892
Say, Rebel?

883
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:13,186
Hey, Andy Richter.

884
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:14,896
Michael Bluth. How you doing, Andy?

885
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:16,648
Oh, yeah. I... I'm Andy.

886
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:19,234
So, I know him. Can I
get on your membership,

887
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,986
- and can you vouch for me? Okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

888
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,195
Whatever you want... it's on Andy.

889
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:23,571
Thank you.

890
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:25,157
It's on this rich (bleep)hole.

891
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:26,616
Bye.

892
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:28,451
<i>But before Michael could find Rebel,</i>

893
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:30,996
<i>he ran into the man, that at that point,</i>

894
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,081
<i>he still thought was her lover.</i>

895
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,373
Ron!

896
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:36,709
- Hey.
- No, no. It's Michael.

897
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:39,963
Michael Bluth... doing the
film about my family and...

898
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,048
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature, though?

899
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,382
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Oh.

900
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:44,717
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

901
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,136
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

902
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:47,553
but I think that he's blowing me off.

903
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:50,056
Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

904
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:52,267
Well, you know, a month
ago, I would have told you

905
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,686
that he and I were exactly
the same, that we were twins.

906
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:59,482
But now, I wouldn't even
think of my son as my brother.

907
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:01,734
You know, the thing is...

908
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:04,279
He's busy.

909
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,618
<i>George Michael finds himself the subject</i>

910
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,620
<i>of a lawsuit over the ownership</i>

911
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:14,622
<i>- of Fakeblock.
- Could you put in a good word</i>

912
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,124
on the missing Lucille 2 case?

913
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,458
That's a career maker.

914
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,543
That's an O.J.

915
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,128
You just need one of those. Huh?

916
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,506
Uh, excuse me, uh, but was
it or was it not my client

917
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:26,759
who put up the initial seed
money for the block software

918
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,971
that served as the underlying
architecture of Fakeblock?

919
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:32,640
- It was 99 cents.
- Times three.
- Times three.

920
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:34,267
Times three.

921
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:39,438
Can I say something to my client?

922
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,733
Take to the sea!

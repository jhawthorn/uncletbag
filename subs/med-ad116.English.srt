1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:05,884
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,083
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,251
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,563
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:22,905
The local colleges
are on spring break...

6
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,567
and things are heating up
in Newport Beach.

7
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:28,805
<i>George Michael was off</i>
<i>from school for two weeks...</i>

8
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:31,108
<i>and was enjoying spending time</i>
<i>with his uncle.</i>

9
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:33,740
I'm intercepting
some telepathic energy...

10
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:37,218
that's telling me
it's the eight of diamonds.

11
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:40,052
That's amazingly close.

12
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:42,649
Gee, I got it wrong. Well.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,228
I guess you won
the shirt off my back.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,822
- Okay, that's amazing.
- It's the queen of diamonds.

15
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,632
No, no, no. I had... But if that
had been the actual card...

16
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:56,229
I'm pretty sure I'd be
almost too blown away.

17
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:59,003
You know, it's a new trick, so I'm
still kind of tweaking my nipples...

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,840
- The presentation was great.
- <i>Hey. Whoa!</i>

19
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:04,176
What's going on here, huh? George
Michael, you should get to school.

20
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:07,080
No, we're off for two weeks.
Gob's teaching me some new tricks.

21
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:10,780
Spring break!
It's my favorite holiday.

22
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,583
Nothing gets me more excited.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,817
I can see that.
You might wanna button that shirt up.

24
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:17,622
No, I'm good.
Anyway, listen, Michael.

25
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,629
I need the yacht.

26
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,199
I kind of made a commitment.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,530
<i>One year earlier, Gob had appeared...</i>

28
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,660
<i>on a youth-oriented</i>
<i>music network...</i>

29
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,103
<i>Newport Beach."</i>

30
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,641
Now that I've gotten
your attention...

31
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,234
I'd like to announce
that one year from today...

32
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,839
I shall make that
beautiful yacht disappear.

33
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,783
<i>Wow. He's amazing.</i>

34
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:46,345
He hasn't done it, and you're
holding a four of spades in your hand.

35
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:48,721
I don't care.
I'm loving the ride, you know?

36
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,852
- How are you gonna do it?
- Well, you've got two weeks off.

37
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:54,227
You're about to find out.

38
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:57,460
Maybe we'll meet a couple
young coeds along the way.

39
00:01:57,568 --> 00:02:01,800
- How young is too young for you?
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

40
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:05,307
There's not gonna be any coeds. There
certainly isn't gonna be any magic.

41
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,038
It is a path to a lonely life
where people mock you.

42
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:11,138
- And you don't even realize it.
- Michael, I'm a magi...

43
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,149
I see what you did.

44
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:16,652
You're not dressed yet? I thought you
were working for me today at the office.

45
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:19,552
You guys stay open
during spring break?

46
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:21,921
We're not Orthodox.
But don't worry about it.

47
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,995
Kitty's coming back,
and it's just in time.

48
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,031
Although she's caused nothing but
problems since she's worked for me.

49
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,726
Kitty, isn't that your phone?

50
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,429
<i>No, I'm on the phone with your dad.</i>
<i>That one's your line.</i>

51
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,940
<i>Kitty, these are not the files I asked for.</i>

52
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:42,706
Oh, then I don't know
what I shredded.

53
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:45,339
Have you had a chance
to type up that report yet?

54
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,113
- No, I have been Googling your father.
- So I've heard.

55
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:55,053
She's been out for two weeks
with this chest thing...

56
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,525
but she's had no problems cashing
the checks I've been sending her.

57
00:02:57,628 --> 00:02:59,789
Speaking of which,
have we gotten anything from Nana?

58
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,263
Buster got a perforated heart
and Gob got that receding hairline...

59
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,266
but you and I pretty much
dodged the bullet.

60
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:07,531
No, I meant in the mail. She usually
sends checks for Maeby's birthday.

61
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,971
There's been cash coming in?
Have you been holding out on me?

62
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,543
No. No, I've been investing it.

63
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:15,578
Let's face it.
I'm better with money than you are.

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,411
- Better at spending it.
- Okay, I tell you what.

65
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,748
I'll take you down to see Nana
if you split the money with me 60/40.

66
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,719
- 55/55.
- Deal.

67
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:27,757
Sounds like you guys are
getting more than you think.

68
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,225
We should go now
before your dad gets back.

69
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,888
- No need going halfsies with him too.
- Right.

70
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:35,056
<i>In fact, Tobias had gone to prison...</i>

71
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,761
<i>to research the role of Frightened Inmate #2</i>
<i>for a film.</i>

72
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,532
<i>This came at a bad time</i>
<i>for George Sr...</i>

73
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,574
<i>who was in a conflict with a</i>
<i>prisoner named White Power Bill...</i>

74
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:47,906
<i>a conflict Tobias</i>
<i>inadvertently helped him solve.</i>

75
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:51,072
I sold you for
a pack of cigarettes.

76
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:54,709
But didn't you come here
to research the nature of fear?

77
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,946
I can't think of a better
teacher than White Power Bill.

78
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,750
He's like a master's course
unto himself.

79
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,825
So you think I'm a coward.

80
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,591
There's only one man
I've ever called "coward".

81
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,630
That's Brian Doyle-Murray.

82
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:10,496
<i>No.</i>

83
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,263
What I'm calling you...

84
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,532
is a television actor.

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,267
Ouch.

86
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,434
<i>And so, Tobias remained in prison...</i>

87
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:21,808
<i>as Lindsay and Maeby arrived at Nana's.</i>

88
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,108
Remember,
she's a very old woman.

89
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:26,877
We're going to get in,
get the cash and get out.

90
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:31,116
Is this who I think it is?

91
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:33,349
Nana!

92
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:37,154
<i>Unfortunately, the woman</i>
<i>who now lived there was not their Nana.</i>

93
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:40,526
A fact that took Lindsay and Maeby
an hour and a half to ascertain.

94
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,531
Go! Go! It's not her!
Drop the photo album!

95
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,533
- We're not in the photo album!
- Drop the pie!

96
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,536
<i>And Michael arrived at work to find Kitty.</i>

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,437
Hey, Kitty, how are you feeling?

98
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:56,002
Much better.
Man, I was really stuffed up there!

99
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:59,048
Up here, Michael. Up here.

100
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,677
Why'd you have to get sick now?
What was the rush?

101
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:04,846
<i>In fact, it was</i>
<i>the previous year's spring break...</i>

102
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,015
<i>that was responsible</i>
<i>for Kitty's rush...</i>

103
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>when the makers</i>
<i>of the popular video series...</i>

104
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:13,525
Girls With Low Self-Esteem,
<i>chose not to include her.</i>

105
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,759
<i>Okay, we got all the good stuffhere.</i>

106
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:21,827
Let's just say I'm looking forward
to a more successful spring break.

107
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,272
- "Break"? You were just out.
- That was my sick leave.

108
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,674
- This is vacation.
- No, you're not going on vacation.

109
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,076
<i>Oh, yes, I absolutely am!</i>

110
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:33,344
If you need me,
I will be at Senor Tadpoles...

111
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,715
- having a margarita made in my mouth.
- No, no. Hey.

112
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,845
Kitty, there will be no
margarita in your mouth.

113
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,788
Oh, yes, there absolutely will be
a margarita in my mouth!

114
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,121
Spring break!

115
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:45,923
- Up here, Michael. Up here.
- Put the shirt back down and keep on moving.

116
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,521
You're fired.

117
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:51,932
I work for your father. You don't have
the hiring and firing power.

118
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,437
I absolutely do, and you're fired.

119
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,169
I don't think your father is
gonna be very happy about this.

120
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,802
But take a good look,
'cause it's the last time!

121
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,050
That's the seventh nipple
I've seen today.

122
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:10,347
<i>And Michael was called to the prison.</i>

123
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,479
<i>What are you doing firing Kitty?</i>
<i>You can't fire Kitty.</i>

124
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,252
- First of all, you don't
have hiring and firing power.
- I do.

125
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,055
- And I had to. She's crazy.
- That's why you don't fire her.

126
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,392
You don't fire crazy.
You never fire crazy.

127
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:23,524
Dad, she's incompetent.
She's completely unprofessional.

128
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:28,128
Look, she just came back from
sick leave, uh, with these...

129
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:31,174
Oh, my God, you paid
for those, didn't you?

130
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:35,109
You got carried away. Hell,
I've been so corrupted by my power...

131
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:37,976
that I even enjoyed
firing my own twin brother.

132
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,141
You should have seen his face
when he was begging me not to.

133
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,219
Well, he's my twin brother.
I can show you.

134
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,626
It was funny.
But, you know...

135
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,288
Kitty had access
to all kinds of information.

136
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,092
God knows what she poked
her nose into.

137
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,861
There's enough evidence
on this boat to put me away.

138
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:00,402
The only real thing
I have...

139
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,937
Oh, God, there's nothing
to hold on to down there.

140
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,033
- You're like a boy.
- What's wrong with you?

141
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:10,602
All these books are cooked!

142
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:15,979
- I'm sorry. I gotta do my job.
- And I gotta get out of prison.

143
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,612
Next time someone threatens me,
I may not have a son-in-law to offer.

144
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,850
I can't come in here
all the t... "Offer"?

145
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,290
I may not have a son-in-law
to offer me counseling.

146
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:26,955
You know, he should have stayed a shrink.
He's very gifted, you know.

147
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:31,228
<i>In fact, Tobias had even</i>
<i>produced a videotape...</i>

148
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:34,236
<i>but its brief success</i>
<i>was due to its misleading name.</i>

149
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,298
<i>Once this was discovered,</i>
<i>all but 10 of the videos were returned.</i>

150
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,743
Hire Kitty back, okay?
For the company. No, no.

151
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,181
For me, Michael.

152
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:51,413
- It is kind of a funny face.
- Oh, come on, now.

153
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:01,965
There's just absolutely no purse
that will go with this outfit.

154
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,330
You've got a little pocket
there, Annyong.

155
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,868
<i>Annyong.</i>

156
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,870
That's not getting old.

157
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:11,237
- Where's Nana?
- I sent her on a wonderful cruise.

158
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:13,242
You just missed
a wonderful call from her.

159
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:17,542
She just came back from a wonderful
costume party that the captain threw.

160
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:20,116
She gained 10 pounds...
there's so much food on that boat.

161
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:22,310
She's up to 74!

162
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,546
It's wonderful, just wonderful.

163
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:28,682
<i>In fact, Lucille's mother</i>
<i>had been dead for six months.</i>

164
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:31,193
She tried pesto
for the first time.

165
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:33,490
Can you believe that?

166
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,964
Ninety-two years old,
and she never tried pesto.

167
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,867
<i>Lucille feared that the family would</i>
<i>come after the inheritance if they found out.</i>

168
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,871
Was she on the phone, Annyong?

169
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:47,539
<i>Annyong.</i>

170
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,374
Emery board.

171
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:54,373
Isn't he great?
And he goes with everything.

172
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:58,717
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was adjusting</i>
<i>to a new companion ofhis own.</i>

173
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,314
<i>That's not the end of the trick.</i>
<i>There's a big surprise coming.</i>

174
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,552
Take your T-shirt off, please.

175
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,789
What? Oh, you changed the trick.
It's a different trick.

176
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:11,061
If I roll up this T-shirt,
put it in this hat...

177
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,932
<i>Gob! Hey, George Michael.</i>

178
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,562
Hang on. We're in
the middle of something.

179
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,608
If you'll be so kind as to
expose your breast, please.

180
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,974
No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey,
what the hell are you doing?

181
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,639
Dad, it's misdirection. You're supposed
to keep your eye on the shirt in the hat.

182
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:28,013
Get downstairs right now.
Come on.

183
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:32,578
- Buddy, what are you doing here?
- I'm dying to see how he
makes this yacht disappear.

184
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,590
He's not going to make
the yacht disappear. I told him that.

185
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:38,423
It's driving me crazy. It's like a mind
puzzle, an awesome mind puzzle.

186
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,429
<i>Michael looked at his son and saw...</i>

187
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,091
<i>that he truly was inspired</i>
<i>by his uncle</i>...

188
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,101
<i>that perhaps the boy</i>
<i>actually admired him.</i>

189
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,797
I gotta get you out of here. You're
gonna come work with me at the office.

190
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,874
Go wait in the stair car.

191
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:55,105
Hey, I want you to explain something to me.
I'm out looking for Kitty...

192
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,670
and I find my son in the middle of
a <i>Girls With Low Self-Esteem</i> video.

193
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,376
Don't worry. He's gonna be covered
with a blue dot. He approached me.

194
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:03,885
And as for Kitty,
I think you're crazy to have fired her.

195
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,979
Who knows what kind
of information she has?

196
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,150
He's my brother,
and he's never even said "Good job."

197
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,285
I just want him to love me,
you know?

198
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:15,354
Wow, you get really girlie after, huh?

199
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:19,197
Yeah, she definitely knows way too much.
Well, go get her. It's the holidays.

200
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,794
- I'm sure she's down at Senor Tadpoles.
- Right.

201
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,874
Having a cocktail made
in her mouth. All right.

202
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:27,307
I'm gonna go take care of that.
In the meantime, stay away from my son.

203
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,345
<i>Wow, Michael, I'm really hurt.</i>

204
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:32,347
<i>It's family. What's more important</i>
<i>than family, Michael?</i>

205
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,974
- This yacht?
- Of course not, Gob.

206
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:37,212
You'd make the deal?
Because I'd sign off on that right now.

207
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,722
<i>I stay away from your son,:</i>
<i>you let me use the yacht.</i>

208
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,019
The holidays really brings out
the best in you.

209
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,651
Well...

210
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:47,094
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias found</i>
<i>his experience as a therapist...</i>

211
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:49,097
<i>was helping him deal</i>
<i>with his new cell mate.</i>

212
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,190
<i>Yes, but where does</i>
<i>the hate come from, Bill?</i>

213
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:55,102
- What causes it?
- TheJews, I guess.

214
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,105
Sure. But I think you need
to look deeper.

215
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,175
I think these are issues
of self-esteem.

216
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,676
<i>I know what it's like.</i>
<i>I know how it feels...</i>

217
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,339
to have a father,
or, in my case, a father-in-law...

218
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,348
who doesn't respect you.

219
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,611
"Anyhoo," we have very
little time...

220
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,517
before this, uh, 4:00 pounding
you promised me.

221
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,749
I'm gonna take a shot
at something and say...

222
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:17,554
that I think you hate
White Power Bill.

223
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:21,358
- I hate you!
- You hate White Power Bill.

224
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:25,026
- I hate the government!
- You hate White Power Bill.

225
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:29,868
I hate my father!
- <i>Recreation.</i>
<i>All prisoners, one hour.</i>

226
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:33,740
Go get 'em.

227
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,978
I hate White Power Bill.

228
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,710
<i>I got a prisoner down! Prisoner down!</i>

229
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:43,548
- You killed him.
- Well, l...

230
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:47,146
Like Dorothy.
The Wicked Witch is dead.

231
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:50,818
All hail Dorothy!

232
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:55,331
<i>And at an elegant restaurant,</i>
<i>Michael asked Kitty to come back.</i>

233
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:59,892
Who are you asking back, Michael?
Me? Or these?

234
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:03,838
I want you all back.
I want the whole gang. Okay? Please, Kitty?

235
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:06,068
I'm trying
real hard here, you know.

236
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,873
Can we just make believe that none of
this ever happened and just start fresh?

237
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,073
Michael, of course I'll come back.

238
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,082
'Cause I never really left...

239
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,652
because we both know
that you can't fire people.

240
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,984
No, I did fire you,
and now I'm hiring you back.

241
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,319
You don't have authority
over me.

242
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:24,087
- They don't have nachos here.
- You know what? Why don't we forget it?

243
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,424
Because I've been trying to be
very, very generous to you...

244
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,465
and you don't respect me,
so I'm firing you, okay?

245
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:33,798
- You are fired.
- All right, Michael.

246
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:36,429
But I know where things are
and you don't...

247
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,499
and you are asking
for a whole world of trouble.

248
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,806
If you're threatening me,
you're gonna be very sorry.

249
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,848
- Are you threatening me?
- Yeah, that's a threat. I'm threatening you.

250
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,282
Did you hear that everyone?
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

251
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:52,685
I've gotta get out of here.
I'm a part of the story.

252
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,850
I can't be a part of the story.
I can't be a part of the story.

253
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,554
Say good-bye
to your company, Michael.

254
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:01,893
- And say good-bye to these.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

255
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,899
'Cause it's the last time.

256
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:12,732
A woman shows all during a fracas
at a local restaurant, sources say.

257
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,946
<i>George Michael was working</i>
<i>harder than ever over his spring break...</i>

258
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,814
<i>filling in for the now</i>
<i>twice-fired Kitty.</i>

259
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,081
Look at us working together.
You get the hang of this...

260
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,384
and this could be your summer.

261
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,482
I don't know, Dad. I really wanted
to see Gob's magic show and...

262
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:33,654
No, you don't. Isn't this much more fun,
working with your Dad?

263
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,994
- It's just, there was some other...
- You gonna get that?

264
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:39,835
- Thanks, Laura.
- Good afternoon. Bluth Company.

265
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:43,498
Talk you off?
Talk you off what, Pop-Pop?

266
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,173
George Michael.
I thought you were, um...

267
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:50,405
When's that voice gonna drop?
Where's Kitty?

268
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:53,847
I think Dad fired her again.
He wants to talk to you.

269
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:57,387
I don't wanna talk to him.
I made my decision, and that's that.

270
00:13:57,488 --> 00:14:01,288
Oh, you heard?
Yeah. All right.

271
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:08,528
- What did he say?
- If I clean it up, it's not really a sentence.

272
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,726
<i>And so, George Sr. made another call.</i>

273
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:15,236
Kitty's on the loose. I need you
to make something disappear for me.

274
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,502
just some books in that cooler
marked "Maddas."

275
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,134
- Great.
- <i>George Sr. hung up...</i>

276
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,271
<i>confident that his problems</i>
<i>would finally be taken care of.</i>

277
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:26,349
Hey, LittleJustice.

278
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,283
You, uh, painted your shoes red.

279
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:32,719
Call me the Tin Man.
I'm a Friend of Dorothy's now.

280
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:36,281
- <i>And she wants to see you.</i>
- <i>And back at the office...</i>

281
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:40,056
<i>Lindsay arrived with her daughter</i>
<i>and her mounting suspicions.</i>

282
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,997
Mom says she sent Nana on a cruise.

283
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,931
You're still on this?
How much was in those birthday cards?

284
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,902
It's not about the money,
Michael. It's about Nana.

285
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,905
I think Mom sent her
to a nursing home...

286
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,771
some gray, windowless room...
against her will.

287
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:56,334
- So what was it like out there today?
- Nice. Sunny.

288
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,243
Wow.

289
00:14:58,348 --> 00:15:00,839
So, how do you think Gob's gonna
make this yacht disappear?

290
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,511
Well, I'll be working here,
so I guess I'll never know.

291
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,781
The only real way to find out
how it's done...

292
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,789
is to sneak on the boat
while he does it.

293
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:10,826
But if he makes it disappear,
won't everyone see me standing there?

294
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:16,161
Let's just sit quietly and consider
how ridiculous that statement was.

295
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:20,768
Anyways, if it was me,
that's what I would do.

296
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,771
I wanna check out
Mom's financial activity.

297
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,932
Call her banks,
maybe run a hospital search.

298
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,203
<i>It's gonna mean a lot of</i>
<i>hard work, but I'll put somebody on it.</i>

299
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:30,212
George Michael.

300
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,646
Where is George Michael?

301
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,683
<i>In fact, at Maeby's suggestion...</i>

302
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,413
<i>George Michael was off to visit</i>
<i>his Uncle Gob.</i>

303
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,455
Hi, Uncle Gob.
I came by to see...

304
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:41,615
if you need any help
with your magic show.

305
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,956
- Great.
- I think it's so great that you're doing this.

306
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:48,554
- I'm prepping right now.
- How'd you get my Dad's permission?

307
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,462
<i>Suddenly, Gob remembered</i>
<i>the promise he had made...</i>

308
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,501
<i>to stay away from Michael's son.</i>

309
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:55,128
None of your damn business.
Get the hell out of here.

310
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,173
- What?
- You don't have the magic in you!

311
00:15:57,274 --> 00:15:59,174
You never did!
You don't have it here!

312
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,971
So take a look. It's the last time
you're gonna see these.

313
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,513
- Sorry, kid, more than you'll ever...
- What?

314
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:13,113
Beat it!
- <i>As Gob was forced</i>
<i>to send away someone he loved</i>...

315
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,987
- You'll be missed.
- <i>George Sr. was forced to visit...</i>

316
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:19,756
<i>someone he had once tried</i>
<i>to shove out of a moving car.</i>

317
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:24,031
- Welcome.
- You're Dorothy?

318
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:27,160
I thought the two of us
could talk, man-on-man.

319
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:31,464
<i>I'm afraid I'm serious.</i>

320
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,543
<i>I</i> bought you.

321
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,107
- Remember to let it steep for five minutes.
- Oh, dear God.

322
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,183
I've been in this family
for 16 years...

323
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:42,514
and I don't think we've
ever had a conversation.

324
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,951
- I'm not gonna discuss this.
- You hate me.

325
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,649
Yeah, I do hate you.
You took my daughter...

326
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,283
my precious little girl...
and moved her away...

327
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:53,625
and now I'm here, and I am afraid
I will never get her back.

328
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,290
Afraid. You're afraid.

329
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,868
Fear has turned into hate.

330
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:02,370
So Frightened Inmate #2
isn't frightened at all.

331
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:06,465
He's angry.
He's a crabby old coot...

332
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,567
and he needs love...

333
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,874
just like everyone.

334
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,972
Get your...
hands off of me.

335
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,950
Shh. Don't be scared.

336
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,356
<i>And on the beach,</i>
<i>the show was beginning.</i>

337
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:37,371
<i>Any magician can make</i>
<i>the queen of diamonds disappear...</i>

338
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,932
but what about a whole boat?

339
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:07,635
<i>Mom, have you seen</i>
<i>George Michael?</i>

340
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:10,172
We just got here.
I couldn't find my keys.

341
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:12,264
- I can never find anything in here.
- We love you!

342
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:18,238
Where once there was a yacht,
now there is naught!

343
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,096
- All right. So how'd you do it?
- Michael, a magician never reveals his...

344
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,495
I sunk it!
I sunk the yacht!

345
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,502
<i>At least I think I sunk it. I mean,</i>
<i>I blew it up, and I don't see it anywhere.</i>

346
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:43,038
My heart was in my throat when
that curtain came down and...

347
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,141
- You sank the yacht?
- Shh!

348
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,039
- You sank the yacht?
- Shh!

349
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:48,703
- You sunk a $700,000 yacht?
- $900,000 worth of insurance on it.

350
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:52,373
And got rid of the evidence.
How about a "good job"?

351
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,849
<i>Seeing a window of opportunity,</i>
<i>Lucille made a startling announcement.</i>

352
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,477
- Nana was on that yacht!
- What?

353
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:01,148
- <i>You killed Nana!</i>
- <i>She's lying!</i>

354
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:03,488
Nana wasn't on that yacht.
She's fine.

355
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:06,187
She's been dead for six months.
- <i>Lindsay had learned</i>
<i>this information</i>...

356
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:09,265
- For about six months.
- <i>when she spoke to the family's personal banker.</i>

357
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,732
<i>Later, fearing that</i>
<i>Lindsay was onto her...</i>

358
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:13,735
<i>Lucille went to the bank herself.</i>

359
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:17,034
<i>There must be somewhere I can put</i>
<i>this money where it can't be touched.</i>

360
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,267
I suppose you could keep it
in your purse.

361
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,504
Very funny, but I'm
not carrying a purse.

362
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:24,671
<i>Where's the money, Mom?</i>
<i>I want the money.</i>

363
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:28,444
You can't have it.
It's in a trust fund for Annyong.

364
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:30,179
-  Annyong.
- <i>No one can touch it but me...</i>

365
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,051
and I retain control of it
until he's 18.

366
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,420
I don't know what's more offensive...
the fact you didn't tell us...

367
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:39,552
<i>about our grandmother's death</i>
<i>or that you sunk a $ 700,000 yacht!</i>

368
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:42,564
<i>Stop lecturing me.</i>
<i>I just lost my mother.</i>

369
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,861
I'm so glad George Michael
wasn't here to see any of this.

370
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:47,368
Maeby, where is George Michael?

371
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:52,272
Um, well, if he's not here, I'd just
have to say he's probably on the yacht.

372
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,240
On the yacht?

373
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:56,812
<i>In fact, George Michael</i>
<i>had boarded the yacht.</i>

374
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,508
<i>But when he saw the evidence</i>
<i>of Gob's lifestyle...</i>

375
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,814
<i>he realized that this perhaps</i>
<i>was not the life he wanted.</i>

376
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,411
<i>While Kitty went in search</i>
<i>of retribution...</i>

377
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:09,117
<i>in the form of the files</i>
<i>in the cooler.</i>

378
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,457
<i>George Michael's a good kid.</i>
<i>I'm sure he's at the office.</i>

379
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,462
Right. I told him
to stay away from you.

380
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:18,125
- I told you to stay away from him!
- I tried. I told him to get out.

381
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,135
Bluth Company.
George Michael speaking, not Kitty.

382
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:23,297
- Thank God you're there.
- I don't need a real spring break.

383
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:27,103
I really think I am much better off here
alone in this office.

384
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,668
<i>Michael realized</i>
<i>what he had done to his son...</i>

385
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,680
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

386
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:35,012
- You're fired.
- Really?

387
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,382
Can you fire people?

388
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,421
Yeah. Go have a spring break.

389
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,957
Thanks, Dad.

390
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,753
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay without Kitty?

391
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,420
Don't you worry.
She'll turn up.

392
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:56,435
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

393
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,509
<i>Lupe makes</i>
<i>a startling discovery.</i>

394
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:03,443
Oh, so that makes
Annyong 18.

395
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:06,015
<i>And Michael finds himself</i>
<i>in the middle of the search...</i>

396
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:08,141
<i>for a missing Kitty.</i>

397
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,912
Well, we have a restaurant
full of people saying...

398
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,851
that you threatened Kitty
the last time she was seen.

399
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,185
How does anybody
even remember this?

400
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:19,024
- She showed her knobs in the steakhouse, sir.
- She...

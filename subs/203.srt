1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,400
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,842
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,948
<i>Michael Bluth arrived at work...</i>

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>to find his brother adjusting</i>
<i>to his newjob as president.</i>

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,185
What have you got there?
"Don't be afraid to make a mi-"

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,557
I'm not gonna
beat myself up over that.

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,362
Oh. It works. So, I wrote your "Message from
the President" on the shareholders' statement.

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,369
Starla's making copies.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,769
Did I tell you that she'd make
a great secretary?

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,035
Yeah. I'm not so sure that
hiring her wasn't a mistake.

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:47,443
And I'm not afraid to make mistakes.
Or have you forgotten this little- Damn it!

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,675
- My legs are so powerful.
- So I thought you might want to read it...

15
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,684
seeing as how you are
the president now...

16
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,449
- even though it's just a title.
- Uh, right. Yes, well...

17
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,024
we should "circumvrent"
union penalties.

18
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,992
- "Circumverate."
- Circumvent. Circumvent. Means to go around.

19
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,824
The old reach around.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,194
Trust me. This makes you
look like a leader. Okay?

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,961
I don't think that
I need any help with that.

22
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,236
it.
Just leave it where it is.

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,308
- Now, if you just flip-
- Here are the copies.

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,572
Hey. These are-
These are very small.

25
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,170
When you said you wanted
photocopies...

26
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,217
I thought that you meant you
wanted them on a photo printer.

27
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,515
Tell you what. From now on,
we're gonna use just the big printer.

28
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,215
Okay. You're a perfectionist.

29
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,224
Flashes of Quincy.

30
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:37,422
<i>Starla claimed to have had</i>
<i>a relationship with music legend QuincyJones.</i>

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,658
Mr. President, I'm gonna go look into
some LEGOLAND tickets for the weekend.

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,567
- Cool. Let's do it.
- Actually, I just meant me and my son.

33
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,400
Isn't he a little old
for that?

34
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,168
No. Sorry.
I've been looking...

35
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,938
to get some alone time with him,
and it just hasn't seemed to work out lately.

36
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,207
No problem. I'll just call up
some of my friends.

37
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,911
- What?
- What friends?

38
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,182
I've got friends, Michael.
I just don't talk to them because...

39
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,053
I work all the time.

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,057
I think the plant lady's
wearing a thong.

41
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,658
<i>Michael, this is</i>
<i>your office now?</i>

42
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,669
Yeah. Well, it's temporary.

43
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,739
We gotta make sure Gob
looks like he's in charge.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,537
Oh. Please. Allow me.
I'll just "circumvrent" you.

45
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,135
<i>Let's make sure we don't</i>
<i>give him any real power.</i>

46
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:31,741
- Mmm.
- So, I gotta a call today from
Gene Parmesan, our private eye.

47
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,786
- He said he found something big.
- We have a private eye, huh?

48
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,449
Oh, I hired him a hundred years ago to find out
if your father was cheating on me.

49
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,289
- He never did find anything.
- Well, he can't be very good then.

50
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,955
- What did he find?
- He said he wanted to tell us in person.

51
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,555
Don't get up. I just a-find-a the supplies...

52
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,101
because I'm a-
Private detective.

53
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,569
Gene Parmesan.
How are you doing?

54
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,936
Gene! Oh, Gene!

55
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,908
- Isn't he the best?
- <i>Gene was far from the best.</i>

56
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,911
- Very impressive.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,311
- What did you find?
- Oh, nothing.

58
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,248
- Just your father's getaway car.
- You're kidding.

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,515
<i>Michael's father had used</i>
<i>the family stairway vehicle to escape from prison.</i>

60
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,523
If I could find Dad, I'd be off the hook.
I could be president again.

61
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,423
- Where is it?
- Mexico.

62
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,759
You get the country for free.
The city-That's gonna cost ya.

63
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,928
- It's a $200 fine.
- Oh!

64
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,302
I feel like such an-

65
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,307
The car is in
a town called Encanta.

66
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,207
If you think that's worth more than $200,
I'd really appreciate it.

67
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,610
- All right. Here.
- I'm not even gonna count it.

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,946
You can leave tomorrow
after my going-away party for Buster.

69
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,612
I still can't believe
he's going into the army.

70
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,621
You know, he's doing it
just to spite me.

71
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,283
- Then why are you throwing him a party?
- Just to spite him.

72
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,223
You guys have such
a healthy thing going.

73
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,853
Okay, I'll go to your party,
and then I'll go to Mexico.

74
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,865
- I guess that'll be my quality time with my son.
- Mexico?

75
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,301
- Yeah. Mom's P.I. Found the stair car down there.
- Gene Parmesan?

76
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,498
Right here.

77
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,133
I counted it. Come on.

78
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,235
<i>And that's when Gob became suspicious...</i>

79
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,476
<i>that Michael had only made him president</i>
<i>to stick him with the failing business...</i>

80
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,383
<i>while Michael himself</i>
<i>escaped to Mexico to be with his father.</i>

81
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,355
- <i>So, inspired by his mother's private detective</i>-
- <i>"Ice."</i>

82
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,552
<i>He decided to hire someone</i>
<i>to keep an eye on his brother.</i>

83
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:25,825
I think I might have someone
who's going to "cirsumvrent" the law.

84
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,924
<i>And Michael returned home,</i>
<i>eager to tell his son of their trip.</i>

85
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,230
George Michael,
what say you and I take a road trip...

86
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,999
down to Mexico tomorrow
right after Buster's party?

87
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,701
- Oh, I can't. I'm meeting Ann.
- Who?

88
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,437
Ann. Here. You took
this picture of us...

89
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,446
in front of that bagel place
before it was burned down.

90
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,108
I guess I thought
she was with another family.

91
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,686
She's kind of my girlfriend.

92
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,051
- Her?
- Do you not like her?

93
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,852
I don't know her.
It's like you spend all your time with her.

94
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,292
It's like you're hoggin' her-
like you're a little Ann hog.

95
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,297
Okay? Don't be such an Ann hog.
But we're gonna go to Mexico.

96
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,367
Try to find Pop-Pop.
It'll be an adventure.

97
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,401
Well-

98
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,597
And 8:01. Curtain has risen.

99
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,802
Hey, Tobias, I was wondering if you were
available tomorrow to go down to Mexico.

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,640
- I need two drivers.
- Alas, I have two shows tomorrow...

101
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,805
<i>where I'm on standby</i>
<i>for the Blue Man Group.</i>

102
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:20,215
Might as well keep this makeup on
since it takes so- long to get off.

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,220
Hmm. Lindsay, what about you?

104
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,052
Uh, can't. I have
a big date tomorrow.

105
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,150
You know, this open marriage is ridiculous.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

106
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,526
The important thing is
that you guys don't lose focus on yourselves.

107
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,058
First of all,
we are doing this for her.

108
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,831
Okay? Because neither one of us
wants to get divorced.

109
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:42,135
<i>And "second-of-ly,"</i>
<i>I know you're the big marriage expert</i>-

110
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:47,269
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot. Your wife is dead.

111
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,583
I'm sorry. That was 100% inappropriate,
and I do apologize profusely.

112
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,588
I'm- Oh.

113
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,749
Okay, look. I don't
have a date tomorrow.

114
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,759
But why can't you ask
Gob to go with you?

115
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,489
<i>Michael and Gob had been to Mexico once before.</i>

116
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,589
- Chiclet? Chiclet?
- You're the Chiclet! Not me!

117
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,827
<i>Unfortunately, in Mexican culture...</i>

118
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,837
<i>this was a much more</i>
<i>inflammatory gesture.</i>

119
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,046
Hey, hey.

120
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,845
<i>I just think you and I would have</i>
<i>a lot more fun.</i>

121
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,921
- Plus you can bring Maeby.
- You know, I've sensed her...

122
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,717
feeling a little
left out lately.

123
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,590
<i>And the next morning,</i>
<i>the family met at Buster's send-off party...</i>

124
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,163
<i>where Lucille was not keeping</i>
<i>her feelings hidden.</i>

125
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,994
- A camcorder.
- That's so you can videotape it...

126
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,002
when they put you in a naked pyramid
and point to your Charlie Browns.

127
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,129
I ought to point to
Uncle Oscar's Charlie Browns...

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
next time you're
on top of him, Mother.

129
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,973
He's moving out.
See how he treats me?

130
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,606
Just because he <i>thinks</i>
I'm having an affair with the boy's uncle.

131
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,846
Yes. And she's not having an affair
with the boy's... uncle.

132
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,092
It's too late for apologies.
I'm going to the army.

133
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,650
Get me out.
You've got to get me out.

134
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,661
Well, I'm headed down
to Mexico to find Dad...

135
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,993
but when I get back,
maybe we'll try to figure something out.

136
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,660
<i>And that's when Buster decided</i>
<i>to sneak into Mexico to avoid the service.</i>

137
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,830
No, no. I think it'll be worked out by then.

138
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,602
- What was that all about?
- I think Buster's gonna escape to Mexico.

139
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,167
Did the secretary not give you the picture
for Dad? I need that to show people there.

140
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,341
- <i>Yeah. She brought that over.</i>
- Well, this, uh, is a blueprint...

141
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,942
of Dad's face.

142
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,682
- She used the big printer.
I'll give her that. Let's go.
- Not so fast.

143
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,055
- Gob, who is that man on the couch?
- Who? That guy?

144
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,129
- He's my friend.
- You don't have any friends.

145
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,130
I have lots of friends,
Lindsay.

146
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,393
<i>In fact, the man was Ice, a bounty hunter...</i>

147
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,401
<i>that Gob hired</i>
<i>to follow Michael.</i>

148
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,028
- Ice may be my best friend.
- George Michael.

149
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,869
- He's moving.
- He's moving.

150
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,205
- Fun party, huh?
- No. No, it isn't.

151
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,802
- Let's go down to Mexico.
- All right. Let me grab Ann real quick.

152
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,143
- Ann's here?
- Yeah. I invited her.

153
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,049
You said you wanted to spend some time with her.
You said I was being an Ann hog.

154
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,088
- Ann Hog's coming? I thought
it was just the two of us.
- Just Ann.

155
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,384
- All right. Load her up in the car.
- All right.

156
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,723
Lupe, that sweater's
not a take-home.

157
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,992
- Michael, give her a ride home.
- I'm gonna have to start
putting people in the trunk.

158
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,763
<i>In fact, at that moment,</i>
<i>Buster was climbing into the trunk.</i>

159
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,400
Mother, when you see this videotape,
you'll know that I left.

160
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,742
Not out of cowardice,
but out of-

161
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,473
Oh, man.
It's tiring in here.

162
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,052
Oh.

163
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,257
<i>Six minutes later,</i>
<i>Michael dropped offhis mother's housekeeper.</i>

164
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,761
Mexico.

165
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,889
<i>In fact, he was in Santa Ana...</i>

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,594
<i>a town six minutes inland</i>
<i>from his own.</i>

167
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,933
<i>But the combination oflosing his glasses</i>
<i>and breathing carbon monoxide...</i>

168
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,371
<i>had impaired Buster's judgment.</i>

169
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,468
Oh, this shall keep me safe
from the hot Mexican sun.

170
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,605
<i>Excuse me. What are you doing?</i>

171
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,310
I'm trying to find a place to live.

172
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,879
<i>Ay.</i>

173
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,789
<i>Michael was heading down to Mexico...</i>

174
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,798
<i>to find his fugitive father.</i>

175
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,835
Can you believe this?
This is my trip with my son...

176
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,872
and he's too busy whispering secrets
to Ann to say one word to me.

177
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,669
- What's that?
- Nothing.

178
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,836
We're not
whispering secrets up here.

179
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,210
<i>Hey. Check out who's on that hog</i>
<i>in the rearview mirror.</i>

180
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,647
- George Michael!
- What?

181
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,685
Twenty miles to LEGOLAND.

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,558
The Ice.

183
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:56,651
- What have you got?
- Still on his tail, about 20 miles from LEGOLAND.

184
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,391
- Go get him, friend.
- You're not my friend. You're a client.

185
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,333
<i>Gob realized that perhaps</i>
<i>he really didn't have any friends.</i>

186
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,701
<i>And Lucille sent hers away.</i>

187
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,933
Buster, Oscar's leaving.
You win.

188
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,872
Buster get in trunk
of car.

189
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,343
So he's not going
to the army.

190
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,382
<i>He must have had Michael</i>
<i>sneak him into Mexico. Oh, thank God.</i>

191
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,713
- It's better this way. Mmm.
- Mmm.

192
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,446
I'll go unpack.

193
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,022
Here's some money. Go see a <i>Star War.</i>

194
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,253
- Who is it?
- <i>Uh, your son.</i>

195
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,461
- What?
- I was looking for Buster.

196
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,091
- He's not here.
- Uh, what are you doing?

197
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:40,366
- <i>I mean, do you want to go out?</i>
- Why are you trying to get me out of the house?

198
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,964
I just thought
that we could hang out.

199
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:50,579
<i>Lucille was suspicious</i>
<i>that Gob was up to some sort of power grab.</i>

200
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,277
Gene Parmesan?
Lucille Bluth.

201
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,946
My son is trying to
get me out of my house.

202
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,421
I think he may be up to something.

203
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,924
Oh. Hold on.
That's probably him.

204
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,895
Gene?

205
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,558
It's just some idiot
with balloons.

206
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,196
- Oh, is it?
- I knew it!

207
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,773
I want you to keep an eye
on my son Gob.

208
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,607
<i>And Buster was finding himself right at home.</i>

209
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,272
Oh, my God.
I used to have a shirt just like that.

210
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,214
<i>It</i> was <i>Buster's old shirt.</i>
<i>Lucille had given it to Lupe.</i>

211
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:29,344
And the hand chair. I had one in my room.
I wonder where that went.

212
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,481
- <i>It went right there.</i>
- I never thought I'd miss a hand so much.

213
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,957
You people are just like me.

214
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,254
<i>Meanwhile, in the real Mexico...</i>

215
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,594
- <i>Michael had found the stair car.</i>
- There it is.

216
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,362
<i>And Michael set about</i>
<i>finding his father.</i>

217
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,429
Oh, yeah. Sure, <i>señor.</i> No problem.
When do you want us to start building?

218
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,542
Thank you.
<i>Gracias.</i>

219
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,669
- <i>Dad? Dad?</i>
- Yeah.

220
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,679
So, what do you
think of Ann so far?

221
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,615
Oh, Ann? I just-
You know, I barely know her.

222
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,281
You know? Neither of us do. She's just really
some girl as far as we're concerned. Right?

223
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,722
- L-l-I'm determined to get to know her.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,158
- Okay?
- Okay. I have an idea. When we go back...

225
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,128
why don't just the two of you go back
in the stair car together?

226
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,358
Well, that's no fun.

227
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,958
For you. You know,
you guys should be together.

228
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,731
- Oh-
- Or maybe just you and me...

229
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,069
- if you'd rather.
- Yeah.

230
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,972
- Or me and Ann-
- Great! Yes. Okay.

231
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,978
I'll tell Maeby that I'll be going back
with her and Aunt Lindsay. Great.

232
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,378
- No, no. Wait. Let's keep looking for Pop-Pop.
- Okay.

233
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,350
Maybe somebody in the church
will know something.

234
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,615
<i>In fact, George Sr.</i>
Was <i>in the church, where he was mourned...</i>

235
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,988
<i>by his longtime assistant</i>
<i>and accomplice to his escape, Kitty...</i>

236
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,392
<i>as only a few days earlier,</i>
<i>he'd been declared dead.</i>

237
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,059
<i>But before Michael could go inside the church</i>-

238
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,900
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

239
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,532
- I know you. You're Gob's friend.
- Not friend. Bounty hunter.

240
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,907
Gene? There's no way
you're that good.

241
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,504
Name's Ice. Gob hired me to stop you
from fleeing the country.

242
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,747
What? Are you kidding me? I'm not fleeing
the country. I'm here looking for my father.

243
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,516
But you're obviously better
at this kind of thing. I'll tell you what.

244
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,526
I'm gonna continue paying you
to find my father.

245
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,028
You can also collect
the real bounty on his head.

246
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,724
Nice deck.
Is this where you saw him last?

247
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,767
No, this-
That's actually him.

248
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,803
- He's just- He's much smaller in real life.
- I can see that's a man.

249
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,271
I'll find him.

250
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,310
- Lucky.
- <i>What did he say? Did he ask about me?</i>

251
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,777
I can't believe he followed us
all the way to Mexico.

252
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,907
Uh, that's a bounty hunter, and, uh,
he's on the case, so we can all head home.

253
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,545
So, he's not interested in me?

254
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,714
Not unless
you know where Dad is.

255
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,792
George Michael.

256
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:55,197
Oh, hi, Dad. Yeah. They think you're in Mexico.
I'll see you when I get home.

257
00:13:55,301 --> 00:14:00,500
Ye- Oh, yes. Thank you. No, I found
my birth control pills. Thanks for asking, <i>Dad.</i>

258
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,233
<i>Maeby had had enough ofher mother...</i>

259
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,243
<i>and decided to go back</i>
<i>with Michael.</i>

260
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,939
I'm so sick of her.
The lame flirting.

261
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,539
<i>Michael, of course,</i>
<i>thought Maeby was referring to Ann.</i>

262
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,414
I think he's gonna get sick of her
before it goes too far.

263
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,647
Of course he will.
She's a child.

264
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,689
Well, that- that part's
not really her fault.

265
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,986
I just hate to see him
wasting his time, you know?

266
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,153
- Let's go. I'll be in your car.
- Is George Michael okay with that?

267
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,595
- It's fine. Just drive.
- <i>At no point...</i>

268
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,929
<i>were Michael and Maeby</i>
<i>talking about the same person.</i>

269
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,127
<i>And there were only</i>
<i>four people in their group.</i>

270
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,072
And it's not a race thing.

271
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,106
Yeah. Whoever
gets there first.

272
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,768
<i>And so Michael left with his niece...</i>

273
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,177
<i>followed by his sister</i>
<i>and his son...</i>

274
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,181
<i>followed by the bounty hunter.</i>

275
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:50,051
<i>Unfortunately, this left the girl Michael was</i>
<i>determined to get to know alone in Mexico.</i>

276
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:54,649
<i>Meanwhile, Buster was adapting</i>
<i>to life in what he thought was Mexico...</i>

277
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,161
<i>but was in fact a town so close to home</i>
<i>that they shared a paperboy.</i>

278
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,994
I know that guy.
Hey! Where's your mother?

279
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,295
Oh, I love this way of life.
This is where I belong.

280
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,370
I love being Mexican.

281
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,407
- We must work now, <i>amigo. Adiós.</i>
- Oh, no. I'm going with you.

282
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,966
I am one of you now<i>. Ssí?</i>

283
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,876
<i>And Michael,</i>
<i>on his way back home, bonded with Maeby.</i>

284
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,814
I mean, why does everyone
have to date anyways?

285
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,409
Right. I mean, isn't family
enough for people?

286
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,547
<i>And, you know, not to feel sorry for myself,</i>
<i>but it's like I'm being forgotten here.</i>

287
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,155
<i>And soon they all arrived at home.</i>

288
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,390
- Hey. You're here already.
- Yeah. We won.

289
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,729
So, uh, you guys have
a good talk?

290
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,600
Yeah. Great talk. That cousin of yours
is a hell of a girl. Too bad you can't date her.

291
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,833
No. I meant-Wait, you wouldn't have
a problem with that?

292
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,578
Nothing. No, I was
talking about Ann.

293
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,671
What did you think of her?

294
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,920
<i>Michael hadjust discovered</i>
<i>he'd left his son's girlfriend in Mexico.</i>

295
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,797
She's gonna be fine.
We just gotta beat the sun.

296
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,696
Hey. You think I'm happy
about this?

297
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,138
But, hey, we are getting
that trip together we wanted, huh?

298
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,300
And look. Two exits
to LEGOLAND.

299
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,378
I just want to find Ann.

300
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,242
That's my whole thing too.

301
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,912
<i>And Gob was still searching for a friend.</i>

302
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:30,682
- Show tonight?
- Well, I won't know officially until 8:01...

303
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,316
but I figured
if I blue myself early...

304
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,658
I'd be nice and relaxed for
a 9:00 dinner reservation.

305
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,255
And if you'd like,
I can make that reservation for-

306
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,268
- Looking for some company or-
- I sure am.

307
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,036
What are you doing?
You're gonna scare away the Ice.

308
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,599
Ice? Ice is out there?
Where's Michael?

309
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,679
He went back to Mexico.

310
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,340
Hmm. I knew he was
trying to flee.

311
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,110
<i>Where the hell did he go?</i>

312
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,152
Whoa!

313
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,120
- Ice, what are you doing?
- George Bluth, you're coming with me.

314
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,953
- <i>That's not my father.</i>
- <i>Well, according to my photograph...</i>

315
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,050
it is.

316
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:13,598
It's an honest mistake.
Also, I think your knee is on my heart.

317
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,497
He's my husband.
My father is probably still in Mexico.

318
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,094
- I was just hoping to have sex with you.
- Why am I not blacking out?

319
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,265
He set me up.
Michael set me up.

320
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,640
Hey. Who wants to go to the hospital?

321
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,270
<i>And Buster went to his job as a dishwasher.</i>

322
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,849
This is great. We're like slave buddies.

323
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,316
Oh.

324
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,516
<i>Soon, the guys arrived</i>
<i>in Mexico and split up to find Ann.</i>

325
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,559
Ann? Ann?
Oh, thank God, you're all right.

326
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,289
- Mr. Bluth?
- Ann. Oh, thank God, you're all right.

327
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,992
Uh, you are Ann, right?
Yes. Of course you are.

328
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,626
- <i>Ann. Oh, my</i>-
- It is. We got her.

329
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,730
Okay. Let's go ahead and load up in the truck.
I think we're crashing some poor guy's wake.

330
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,045
Michael, Michael, Michael!

331
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,670
- Gob? What are you doing?
- Fleeing the country. You bastard.

332
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,681
No. I'm still not
fleeing. Okay?

333
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,842
I'm just here to pick up
my son's girlfriend.

334
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,920
She ran off the last time
we were leaving.

335
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,957
- Actually, I was sitting right there the whole time.
- Yeah? Way to plant, Ann.

336
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,993
George Michael, uh, listen.
Why don't you and Plant wait in the stair car.

337
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,757
- I'm gonna finish up with Gob.
- What a scare.

338
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,593
- That's his girlfriend?
- Yeah.

339
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,690
- Is she funny or something?
- Don't worry about it.

340
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,770
- Why do you keep thinking that I'm running away?
- It is kind of suspicious.

341
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,169
You didn't even ask me
to drive down here with you.

342
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,073
The only reason I didn't ask you to come
is because of your chicken impression.

343
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,873
- We sure did get in a lot
of trouble for that last time.
- Yeah.

344
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,540
- I was all-
- Hey, no. You're doing it again.

345
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,215
Get off him. He doesn't know
what he's doing. He's American.

346
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,221
<i>Americano,</i> eh?
Just like me.

347
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,848
Gene Parmesan.
How you doing?

348
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,053
- Gene! What the hell are you doing?
- Your mother sent me to find you.

349
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,258
- She was worried you were up to something.
- I was just looking for a friend.

350
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,391
- What?
- Yeah, that's right, Michael.

351
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,232
I went to our mother
because I don't have any friends.

352
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,068
- <i>Oh, that's funny.</i>
- Thank you.

353
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,108
Gene, can I have
a private moment, please?

354
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,109
- Okay. You're on the clock.
- Thank you.

355
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,236
Gob, what are you
talking about?

356
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,373
If anybody needs a friend right now, it's me.
My son's furious at me...

357
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,283
and he spends all his free time with this girl
that, frankly, I'm not that crazy about.

358
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,049
Not crazy about?
Or not crazy about your son growing up?

359
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,484
Uh- Maybe- Maybe
you're right about that.

360
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,960
And I really haven't
gotten to know her.

361
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,497
I've been
a little selfish. So-

362
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,726
See? You are a friend.

363
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,963
You know, I'm- I'm always gonna
look out for you. All right?

364
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,904
And you're always gonna
look out for me.

365
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,211
Sorry. I did see him
coming. It's just...

366
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,976
I kind of wanted to see
where you were going with that.

367
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,787
Where's Uncle Gob?

368
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,756
Well, I gave the bounty hunter
and the P. I<i>...</i>

369
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,259
a few extra bucks to be his friends
for the weekend-

370
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,192
while the three of them
are looking for my father.

371
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,663
And I want to get to know
a new friend too.

372
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:06,466
Ann, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

373
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,867
<i>The next day, Buster was happy.</i>

374
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,310
<i>And he decided to never go home again.</i>

375
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,281
Delivery from the kitchen.
- <i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>he was already there.</i>

376
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,817
- Mother!
- Buster!

377
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,979
- I thought you were in Mexico.
- So did I.

378
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,149
Oh!
- <i>And the next day,</i>
<i>Michael returned to work...</i>

379
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,352
<i>knowing a little more</i>
<i>about his son's girlfriend.</i>

380
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,760
Tell Ann to make sure she studies
for Mr. Mason's Algebra II test tomorrow...

381
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,630
and tell her to make sure that Kim Cho
doesn't cheat off her this time.

382
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,168
Wow. You really
got to know her.

383
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,740
Well, we did spend
three hours together in that car ride.

384
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,833
- So, what'd you think?
- I don't like her.

385
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,344
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

386
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,507
<i>Buster reclaims</i>
<i>his favorite chair.</i>

387
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,211
<i>But the victory is short-lived.</i>

388
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,313
Make love in
your own hand, Mother!

389
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,187
<i>And Tobias gets</i>
<i>medical attention.</i>

390
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,194
Thank God! A new doctor. Finally we can get
a straight answer in this place.

391
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,197
Uh, I've got
some bad news.

392
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm Gene Parmesan. How you doin'?

393
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,668
He got me again!

394
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,707
But I did overhear that
he's bleeding internally.

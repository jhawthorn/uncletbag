1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,050
<i>Michael Bluth</i>
<i>had scheduled a meeting with Stan Sitwell...</i>

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,590
<i>the Bluth Company's</i>
<i>chief competitor.</i>

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,751
Why are we having this meeting at home?

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,661
Let him see he's not the only one
who builds solid houses, you know?

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,463
I think he'll be pretty impressed,
knock on wood.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>In fact, Michael was meeting</i>
<i>at home at the behest ofhis fugitive father.</i>

11
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,908
<i>...knock on wood.</i>

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,504
Don't you find the timing
of this meeting a little suspicious?

13
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,915
Right before we play
<i>his</i> company in softball?

14
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,988
No, no. Our business is in trouble,
and I think he sees an opportunity.

15
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,058
So, I figured the guy's a family man,
why not invite him over...

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,787
- let him see us in our element.
- I hope you don't mean the whole family...

17
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,591
- 'cause George Michael's off with Ann.
- Ann?

18
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,996
<i>Hmm. That'll play well with Sitwell.</i>
<i>"Where's your son?" "He's out with Ann."</i>

19
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,968
"Who's Ann?" "Don't ask me,
I'm just the boy's father."

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,539
Hey, screw Sitwell!
He comes in here telling us...

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,303
how to build our houses,
how to raise our kids.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,776
We know what we're doing.
We don't need any help from him.

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,508
Damn it. This thing got pushed in again.

24
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,777
- Gonna need a butter knife.
- <i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

25
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,285
George Michael's got these powerful
little fingers. He should be here.

26
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,186
How do you think I feel?
He said he would help me on this essay...

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,260
- for <i>The Old Man and the Sea.</i>
- <i>I'll help you with that later.</i>

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,524
Oh, great. Okay. So you have to
read this, and then explain it...

29
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,122
and, this is important,
say it in my own words, okay?

30
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,032
Smart, but not too smart.
Let's have a four-syllable max.

31
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,072
Do you wanna say something
or should I, Tobias?

32
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,801
No. I believe in letting children learn
from their mistakes, Michael.

33
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,107
They make a mistake once,
they shan't make it twice.

34
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,580
Oh, here I go!

35
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:01,245
<i>Don't worry. It has not fallen</i>
<i>into the garage. Knock on wood.</i>

36
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,482
You gonna want to help me with that?

37
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,083
No, I can't.
I have an audition tomorrow.

38
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:12,563
I'm up for a minor, but meaty, role
in a feature film.

39
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,328
- "Confidence Man Two."
- Oh, yeah? I didn't see the first <i>Confidence Man.</i>

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,030
No. Confidence Man Two
is my character.

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,540
I think I'll drive up today
and plot my route to the studio.

42
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,872
How 'bout I come with you?
I could help you prepare.

43
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,415
Yes, well, it's for a con man, which
I don't think you know anything about.

44
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,110
And besides, don't you have school?

45
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:37,121
No. Um- Today is
"Help Your Dad Follow His Dream" day.

46
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,750
Great. We can take the carpool lane.

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,852
- I need ice.
- I'm glad Sitwell's coming over.

48
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,023
<i>Let him see that</i>
<i>we're doing fine as a family.</i>

49
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,761
<i>The only help we need</i>
<i>is from each other.</i>

50
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,497
- And apparently whatever's in that bottle.
- Thanks for reminding me.

51
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,199
- My Teamocil.
- Wait a minute. Teamocil?

52
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,800
Isn't that that supplement that you and Tobias
were hocking before the F.D.A. Shut you down?

53
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,040
<i>In the mid '90s,</i>
<i>Tobias formed a folk band...</i>

54
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,981
<i>to promote a supplement</i>
<i>that promised better unity and teamwork.</i>

55
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,282
- Teamocil
- Teamocil may decrease your sex drive.

56
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,051
- Teamocil
- Good job, buddy.
- Thanks, friend.

57
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,685
Since I've been taking this again, I've been
getting along great with my husband.

58
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,763
You're taking it for the side effect,
aren't you?

59
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,331
- <i>Michael.</i>
- Oh God.

60
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,400
Mother, not a good time.
I'm having a meeting here.

61
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,299
- Look at what Buster sent from the army.
- It's blacked out.

62
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,395
Oh, the government.
Keep reading.

63
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,304
"Sergeant Blank is
treating me very blank...

64
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,378
"and it looks like I'll be shipping off
to blank in about a blank.

65
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,641
- I blank you, Mother. Buster."
- I've done everything I can.

66
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,046
I even tried to convince them he's gay,
but no one would believe...

67
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,176
that a woman like me
would have a gay son.

68
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,084
Well, you certainly tried. You guys wore
matching outfits till he was 12.

69
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,089
<i>Even once on a magazine cover...</i>

70
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,853
<i>that had been mocked</i>
<i>within the family for years.</i>

71
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,193
Lucille, l-I'll say it again. You never know
what's going to happen in the army.

72
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:56,860
- Remember, Lucille?
- No, I don't.

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,939
- Get me a vodka, rocks.
- Mom, it's breakfast.

74
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,837
- And a piece of toast.
- Please, Stan Sitwell's coming over.

75
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,708
<i>That hairless freak is coming here?</i>
<i>None ofhis hair is real, you know.</i>

76
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,840
You mean the guy we're meeting with
can't even grow his own hair? Come on!

77
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,579
It's called alopecia, and I'd appreciate it
if we could all be sensitive to it, okay?

78
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,282
He happens to be
a very modest and generous man.
- <i>Modest and generous?</i>

79
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,360
Then why is he always waving giant
$10 million checks over his head...

80
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,919
- every time some-
- Go ahead, Mom. Finish your thought.

81
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,057
"Every time some children's
hospital needs funding"?

82
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,625
Nonetheless, we could get
a giant checkbook too.

83
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,138
We're just not
that starved for attention.

84
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,206
<i>And later, Sitwell</i>
<i>laid out his plans.</i>

85
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,144
- Sorry that my son couldn't be here-
- Let me guess. Girlfriend.

86
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:46,048
You know, it could be worse. He could
wanna marry your mother.

87
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,586
Oh, I'm sorry. Is your family not
laughing at that yet?

88
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,315
Okay. Let me tell you
what I'm offering.

89
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,721
You got a wonderful piece of property
here that's going nowhere.

90
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,623
So what I propose is a co-venture
with your Sudden Valley Development.

91
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,356
The first thing you might
wanna change though is the name.

92
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,433
You know, Sudden Valley conjures up
the image of a sinkhole, no?

93
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,332
I told that to Dad.
I told that to my dad.

94
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,531
<i>I'm thinking</i>- <i>Paradise Gardens.</i>

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,269
I swear to God, I have that written-

96
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,369
I want you to see so you don't think-
I have that written down in my notebook.

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,448
<i>When George Sr. Was in charge...</i>

98
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,007
<i>he had a habit of shooting down</i>
<i>any idea Michael came up with.</i>

99
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:24,749
And Sudden Valley just sort of implies that
something awful could happen all of a sudden.

100
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,349
- Plus, it's on a hill.
- What are you taking, stupid pills? Come on.

101
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,429
Save us some money.

102
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,363
<i>This was a management tool</i>
<i>that he used to keep Michael...</i>

103
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,027
- <i>working for his approval.</i>
- That was a hard one to say no to.

104
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,764
The only thing I ask is
out of the 450 homes we build...

105
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,363
one be given to a disadvantaged family
from the inner city.

106
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,411
<i>That's great. So the other</i>
<i>449 families live in fear?</i>

107
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,709
Is that what we're saying?
I mean, come on! Where's your decen-

108
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,114
What the hell just fell off your face?

109
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,210
- One of this guy's eyebrows fell in the candy beans.
- I always carry a spare.

110
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,381
<i>Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl</i>
<i>of candy beans.</i>

111
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,482
Gob! I'm very impressed
with the offer.

112
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,255
I'm gonna run it upstairs,
see what kind of reaction it gets.

113
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,161
- Hmm?
- So to speak.

114
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,757
- <i>Michael hoped to impress his father.</i>
- I think it sounds pretty good.

115
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,861
Pretty good? It was horrible.
What are you taking, stupid pills again?

116
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,066
<i>But their old dynamic</i>
<i>returned when George Sr. Did.</i>

117
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,804
Gob was the only one down there
who knew how to handle that hairless freak.

118
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,039
- Thank God we have Gob on our team.
- You know, Dad...

119
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,946
Gob doesn't really do
all that much for our team.

120
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,645
In fact, I think it's time
that I get put back in charge.

121
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,154
Michael, listen to me.
Lately, your ideas, they're horrible.

122
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,748
<i>And Sitwell's just trying to</i>
<i>figure out our batting order...</i>

123
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,351
for the softball game
on Saturday, I'm telling you.

124
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,953
Gob said the same thing, Dad,
but l-I doubt that this guy's...

125
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,626
trying to drop $15 million
to find out our batting order.

126
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,600
Hey. This game goes way, way back.

127
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,832
<i>It was a fierce rivalry, with George Sr. Using...</i>

128
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,172
- <i>everything at his disposal to win</i>-
- No hair. Hey, we got no hair.

129
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:56,942
<i>While Stan Sitwell used the game</i>
<i>to raise funds for underprivileged children.</i>

130
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:01,110
- Oh, I think one of your orphans
is heading towards the street.
- Strike three.

131
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,018
You go down there, and you tell him
to go screw himself...

132
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,522
and apologize to your brother.

133
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,059
We need him on our side,
and we need him happy.

134
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,492
- Where's Sitwell?
- Sorry. I told him to screw off.

135
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,565
- But get this, he offered me a job.
- What?

136
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,635
Well, I'm not waiting
on my brother. I pass.

137
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,228
- You look surprised.
- I'm sorry. I must've put it on too high.

138
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,968
But you were right. It was a bad offer
and you were smart enough not to take it.

139
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,375
You got gumption. You speak your mind. That
means you're good enough to work for me.

140
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,141
you.

141
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,876
And I accepted.
He's waiting for me outside.

142
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:36,216
We're gonna swing by his wigmaker.
His "just woke up" hair is finally ready.

143
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,586
You're really gonna do this?

144
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,991
It's ready, Mike. They're only
gonna hold it for 24 hours.

145
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,054
<i>Tobias and Maeby, meanwhile,</i>
<i>had mapped the route to the audition.</i>

146
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,624
Well, here we are
and home we go...

147
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,069
with plenty of time
to get you to English class.

148
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,232
Wait. You can't do
a U-turn on your dream.

149
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,142
I say, we get you on the lot and get
the Fünke name out there.

150
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,704
- Start talking you up around the watercoolers.
- Maeby, we'll never get on here.

151
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,343
I mean, behind these walls
are the biggest stars in the world.

152
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,081
<i>America's treasures.</i>

153
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:16,517
- Damn it!
- Dad, you're auditioning for the part
of a confidence man.

154
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,358
Let's try a little confidence.

155
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,058
You say confidence man?
Hey, I'm up for that part too.

156
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,465
- Oh.
- Good luck to you.

157
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,366
Good luck to you too.

158
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,871
<i>As Tobias was gaining</i>
<i>self-confidence...</i>

159
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,908
- <i>Michael was struggling to keep his.</i>
- Hi, Dad.

160
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,705
- Wow, you're president again?
- Yes, this is the way it should be.

161
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,474
What do you think of when you hear
the words, "Sudden Valley"?

162
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,483
Salad dressing, I think. But for
some reason, I don't wanna eat it.

163
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:44,488
- Right. But "Paradise Gardens."
- Yeah. Okay. I can see marinating a chicken in that.

164
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,957
Um, I'm actually here about the softball game.
We need some girls on the team, right?

165
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,891
Yes, we do.
That's a league requirement.

166
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,897
<i>One that was difficult to meet,</i>
<i>given Gob's behavior...</i>

167
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,331
<i>in the third inning</i>
<i>oflast year's game.</i>

168
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,265
We could stay here,
wait for another pop-up.

169
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,635
- <i>And in the fifth inning.</i>
- Come on! Yeah, here we go!

170
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,072
<i>Oh, and before the game.</i>

171
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,747
We lost our entire outfield
and a couple of court cases.

172
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,249
Well, you know who would be great
and not at all litigious is Ann.

173
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,911
- Mmm, not Ann.
- No?

174
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,821
'Cause you know this-this
game is kind of our thing.

175
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,189
But Ann's amazing.
You know, she could play my position.

176
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,162
You should be playing the field...
there, in right, you know?

177
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,529
Plus, I got Aunt Lindsay playing this year.
I can't very well pull her off the roster.

178
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:33,128
Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good
way to think about her... as a backup.

179
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,036
- She's gonna be so excited.
- Good.

180
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,941
- Maybe-Maybe now I'll get a kiss.
- Okay.

181
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:43,209
Oh. I meant from Ann.

182
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,452
Yes, I know.
I just want to get in there first.

183
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,351
Okay.

184
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,390
Lindsay, wake up. I need you
to play on the softball team this year.

185
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,622
<i>Lindsay felt the intended effect of Teamocil</i>-

186
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,360
- <i>a sense of camaraderie.</i>
- Count me in, Michael. Happy to help the team.

187
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,466
- Great news. I'm back.
- You just left.

188
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,701
Yeah, I don't think
things are gonna work out with Sitwell.

189
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,779
<i>I mean, we picked up his sleepy-head wig,</i>
<i>everything was cool.</i>

190
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,404
Next thing I know, he's asking me
for a bunch of work ideas.

191
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,576
So, I thought I'd just quit
and go back to being president here.

192
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,247
I need to do this job, okay?
I need to <i>prove</i> that I can do this job.

193
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,987
- To who?
- To... you.

194
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:33,156
Michael, I'm your big brother.
I'll never be impressed with you.

195
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,233
- Still.
- Anyway, look. You can still do it.

196
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,896
I just want the office
and my stuffs and title.

197
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:45,171
What about... if I help you with
your work over at Sitwell?

198
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,837
- You'd do that?
- Sure.

199
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,381
You really want me
to succeed at Sitwell.

200
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:56,115
Well, I just- Hey. Come on. I really want
you to be over at Sitwell.

201
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:05,959
<i>Lucille was worried that her son</i>
<i>Buster was being sent into battle with the army.</i>

202
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,193
I feel that we've not brought
something up that might be a solution...

203
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,861
um, to spare my feelings.

204
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,429
Send you in his place? I called.
They don't want you back.

205
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:20,171
<i>Oscar had served in Vietnam</i>
<i>as a croc spotter on a Swift boat.</i>

206
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,509
Croc! No, Sorry. Wait. Log.

207
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,583
Just a log.
No, wait. Sorry. Croc!

208
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,984
<i>It was there that he met</i>
<i>a young U.S.O. Dancer named Lucille.</i>

209
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,953
<i>I prefer an older man.</i>

210
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,653
- <i>Hey, I'm free after the show.</i>
- <i>I said older, Bob, not dead.</i>

211
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,624
I swore I'd never
say his name again, but...

212
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,395
it's time to call you-know-who.

213
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:47,632
<i>"You-know-who"was</i>
<i>an army sergeant named Bill Anderson.</i>

214
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,473
<i>He and Lucille were an item</i>
<i>before she left him for Oscar.</i>

215
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:57,379
<i>At the studio, Tobias began to</i>
<i>create buzz around the watercooler.</i>

216
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,474
That Fünke is some kind of something.

217
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,849
Boy, this Fünke is all anybody's
ever talking about.

218
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,287
So sick and tired of hearing about
how brilliant that Fünke is.

219
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,452
Overrated.
I'll just move- I'm sorry.

220
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,087
Okay. We're okay. Okay.

221
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,827
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby looked for</i>
<i>an empty office to call George Michael.</i>

222
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:20,031
Where are you? I bought you a day.
I can't put this book report off forever.

223
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,334
<i>Sorry, is this your office?</i>

224
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,968
No. I'm just sitting behind someone else's
desk pretending these are my kids.

225
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,104
<i>Can you getJude Law</i>
<i>in here for a meeting?</i>

226
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,274
- Oh, I'm just a reader.
- A reader?

227
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,012
- Yeah.
- I need a report by tomorrow.

228
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:39,751
<i>Before gym-lunch...</i>
<i>with Jim... Carrey.</i>

229
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,123
It's the <i>Grinch</i> guy.
You're too young.

230
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,865
So get this.
Sitwell loved my ideas.

231
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,938
Well, my ideas and I knew it.
That's great.

232
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,836
- You know, Dad never complimented any of those.
- Here's the thing.

233
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,809
- I need <i>more.</i>
- There were 34 proposals in there.

234
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,642
You'd be amazed how fast they come out
when you read them all in a row.

235
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,878
"Thirty-one, bamboo floor upgrades.
Cheaper, stronger." I can't read this word.

236
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,921
"Thirty-two, wireless 'crapability."'
That one explains itself.

237
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,320
- "Thirty-three"-
- Gob, that was six-months' worth of work.

238
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,392
- You can't just blurt them all out at once.
- <i>Mr. Bluth.</i>

239
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,724
- He's coming. I've got to go.
- You blew them away.

240
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,630
Bought you something. Maybe
we can play catch sometime.

241
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,033
<i>Gob's own father had only</i>
<i>once played catch with him.</i>

242
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,233
<i>And it ended as badly</i>
<i>as any game of catch could end.</i>

243
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,469
- White power!
- Better yet, maybe we can play ball on Saturday.

244
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,547
I'll meet you there.
I've got a neck hair fitting at 11:00.

245
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:40,608
<i>Gob was both angry...</i>
<i>and overwhelmed...</i>

246
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,847
<i>by the approval</i>
<i>from this new father figure.</i>

247
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,016
<i>It was confusing.</i>

248
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,027
<i>Michael was less torn</i>
<i>and went to brag to his father.</i>

249
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,862
So, apparently my ideas aren't so bad,
and that comes from Sitwell himself.

250
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,698
- You let your ideas go to Sitwell?
- Uh, no. I gave them to Gob...

251
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,535
who, uh, works there now.

252
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,609
You let Gob go to Sitwell?

253
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,008
- What'd I tell you? I told you-
- "Don't let him go." I know.

254
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:10,047
- But my point is that I do all the work, Pop.
- He makes all the plays.

255
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,481
Don't you understand? He was the best
softball player in the league.

256
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:17,716
<i>Gob was especially gifted</i>
<i>at sacrificing his body for the play.</i>

257
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,951
- <i>Play's at second. Play's at second.</i>
- Yeah! Suck on that, Sitwell.

258
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,551
<i>Although at times,</i>
<i>even that wasn't enough.</i>

259
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,495
Your Tweety Bird dance
just cost us a run, you moron.

260
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,829
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>Sitwell hired him?</i>

261
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,301
You can't do this. You're gonna lose the game,
the company, and you can't do this.

262
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,396
What are you saying? If I win the game,
you're comfortable with me running the company?

263
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,634
- That's what I'm saying.
- I'll win the game.

264
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,007
And I'll show him that
his little plan didn't work, all right?

265
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,742
- We can build houses. We can win games.
- That is what I wanna hear.

266
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,911
We can win games.

267
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,424
Lindsay, did that oven vent hit you?
Your foot is bleeding.

268
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:58,121
My foot is bleeding.
- <i>Teamocil may cause</i>
<i>numbness of the extremities.</i>

269
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,198
You're gonna be able
to play on our team, right?

270
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,598
- Why do you think I'm taking Teamocil?
- To curb your sex drive.

271
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,602
That's right. What team
are you talking about?

272
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,299
<i>It may also cause</i>
<i>short-term memory loss.</i>

273
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,104
<i>Okay. Looks like I'm gonna need</i>
<i>that female backup player after all.</i>

274
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,146
- And Ann's really good at softball, huh?
- <i>Yeah. She's amazing.</i>

275
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,841
You know, she's got this low center
of gravity. You can't knock her over.

276
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,680
- Well, <i>I</i> could knock her over.
- Dad, I'm telling you, you can't.

277
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,016
<i>They call her "The Wall,"</i>
<i>you know?</i>

278
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:27,286
Well, that's great. But I could
knock her over. I won't, but I could.

279
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,021
- <i>And Lucille called on an old lover.</i>
- William?

280
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,563
- Yes, ma'am?
- You don't remember me?

281
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,795
<i>General Anderson had done</i>
<i>three tours of duty in Vietnam...</i>

282
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:41,862
- <i>but the only memory he'd blocked</i>
<i>was being left by Lucille.</i>
- Oh, God. That touch.

283
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,842
- Oh, how could I forget? Pat?
- Lucille.

284
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,812
I could never forget that touch.

285
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,645
Bill, they're shipping my son Buster off.
I can't have that happen.

286
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:57,051
- I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
- Is there anything I can do?

287
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:03,420
Maybe if you... go downtown.

288
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,397
Oh, I haven't done that in 30 years.

289
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,606
You make me want to puke, Bluth!

290
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,511
<i>And so, Buster was pulled out</i>
<i>of combat training</i>-

291
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:28,177
- Put 'em down and halt!
- <i>and put into U.S.O. Training.</i>

292
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,516
- It jolts, but it's not really doing it right now.
<i>- And back at Gob's new office.</i>

293
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,424
- Michael.
- Do you still need those ideas?

294
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,362
<i>Come on. Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>I can't let Sitwell down.</i>

295
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,027
- L-I'm desperate here.
- Then I'll make you a deal.

296
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,129
- I want you to throw the softball game.
- Never!

297
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,902
- He gave me this.
- Course he did. Why do you think he hired you?

298
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,877
He liked my ideas.

299
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,879
They were my ideas,
and, no, he didn't.

300
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,712
He wants you for the softball game because
he's trying to make our family look foolish.

301
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:04,653
I knew you had bad ideas.
All right, we'll play <i>him.</i>

302
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,385
I'll throw that softball game.

303
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,724
Nobody makes a fool of
our family without my help.

304
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:21,334
<i>Tobias had talked up the name</i>
<i>Fünke, and it was time to audition.</i>

305
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,170
- What's your name?
- Tobias.

306
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,301
He's too short. Give it to the guard.

307
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:31,748
Oh. L- I'm not. L-
On camera, I seem much taller.

308
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,149
<i>And Maeby picked up the reader's report,</i>
<i>which had now become her book report.</i>

309
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,950
- Whatcha got there?
- I can't really discuss it.

310
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,457
If you wanna get it made,
I'm the guy who has to see it.

311
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,188
You're the Fünke everyone's talking about?
What are you, like, 15?

312
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:48,164
- Marry me.
- Everyone thinks I look young too.

313
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,259
- So who are you thinking about?
- Jude Law. Why do you ask?

314
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,838
Yeah. Go young<i>. Young Guy and the Sea.</i>
Big spring-breaker.

315
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,931
Four C.G.I. The fish.
Let's fast-track this one.

316
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,443
<i>And that's when Maeby realized</i>
<i>she had become a successful film executive.</i>

317
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,707
- It's all waxed up.
- All waxed up? What do you mean?

318
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,807
- I need something. Ajob for my dad.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay.

319
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,285
Listen to me.
Brand new cars don't get waxed!

320
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,856
<i>That afternoon it was game time...</i>

321
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,448
<i>and Michael felt confident</i>
<i>about a Bluth win.</i>

322
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,192
Spin, spin, spin.

323
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:24,031
<i>Ann wasn't as amazing as</i>
<i>George Michael led his father to believe.</i>

324
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,299
<i>But Gob was playing</i>
<i>worse than ever...</i>

325
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,307
<i>as per his agreement with Michael.</i>

326
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,082
<i>Your guy can't hit, Sitwell.</i>
<i>He's never gonna touch it.</i>

327
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,245
- Time out.
- Time out.

328
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,482
Gob, are you okay?

329
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,389
Yeah, just can't hit today.
Guess you're really disappointed in me.

330
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,657
Hey. Everybody has days like this.
It's only a game.

331
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,823
After that list of ideas you gave me,
I don't care if you blow the whole season.

332
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,663
Come here, you.

333
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,834
Okay. We're good.

334
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,898
<i>And Gob finally felt</i>
<i>that someone believed in him.</i>

335
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,673
<i>Even though they weren't his ideas.</i>

336
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,408
<i>And he decided</i>
<i>to make Sitwell proud.</i>

337
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,680
<i>Get on that ball!</i>

338
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,515
You go!

339
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,527
You better pull an ankle or something.

340
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,529
<i>Come on, George Michael!</i>
<i>Get that ball in there!</i>

341
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,690
<i>Then he went headfirst into The Wall.</i>

342
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,767
- I'm safe.
- You're out!

343
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,201
<i>Out? I was safe! I'm safe!</i>

344
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,365
- Stop with the Tweety Bird dance, you moron.
- Dad?

345
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,807
He made the call. You're out.
What are you doing?

346
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,708
- Shush, shush, shush.
- Dad?

347
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,212
- He's safe.
- What the hell are you doing here?

348
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,409
I'm taking care of what you
screwed up. You blew it again, Michael.

349
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,887
Let me tell you something. I blew it when
I let you start controlling me again.

350
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,889
I even stooped to cheat here
at a softball game.

351
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,391
You've been talking to each other.
How come nobody called me?

352
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,793
- What's going on there?
- I'm just fixing something that's been bugging me.

353
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,491
<i>He was safe.</i>

354
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,229
He was. We lost.
Get over it.

355
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,829
Yeah, and Stan Sitwell liked my ideas.
He really believed in me.

356
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,738
- My ideas.
- Well.

357
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,743
And I'm president, whether
you like it or not, Dad.

358
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,972
I don't need your approval anymore.

359
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,848
- I'm proud of you.
- Really?

360
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,046
Yeah. See ya.

361
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,583
Michael, I could've sworn
I just saw Dad.

362
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,095
Or not. I think hallucination
is one of the side-effects ofTeamocil.

363
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,324
<i>It isn't.</i>

364
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,731
- Thanks for making the right call there, Mike.
- Yeah.

365
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,963
- Sorry I didn't blow the game.
- No. You did the right thing...

366
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,632
and you finally got Dad
to one of your ball games.

367
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,369
- Screw him.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,140
I miss him so much.

369
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,012
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

370
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,314
- <i>Maeby gets her father a job.</i>
- I gotta fire one of ya.

371
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,116
<i>Andy Richter! Here are those head shots</i>
<i>I was telling you about.</i>

372
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,681
- Yeah. I gotta go.
- It's Tobias Fünke. I told you about the head shots?

373
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,284
<i>And Buster visits the general.</i>

374
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,796
I just wanted to thank you for my new job.

375
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,459
- What's wrong?
- I'm shipping out tomorrow.

376
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:16,303
- I've got just the thing.
- Oh. I haven't felt hands like that in years.

377
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,343
You are coming to the front.

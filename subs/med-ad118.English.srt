1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,591
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,684
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,964
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:23,671
<i>Against his betterjudgment,</i>
<i>Michael had recently set out...</i>

6
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:27,373
<i>to have an uncomplicated</i>
<i>one-night stand with this woman.</i>

7
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,882
<i>And at his brother's suggestion,</i>
<i>he gave a false identity.</i>

8
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:32,885
Chareth Cutestory.

9
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:35,956
<i>And what started as a night</i>
<i>of passion with no strings attached...</i>

10
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:40,426
<i>got complicated the next morning</i>
<i>when Michael found out she was blind.</i>

11
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,793
<i>He decided to keep seeing her</i>
<i>so as not to appear superficial.</i>

12
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:47,095
- If it's a one-night stand, I'm not very good at it.
- Wow.

13
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:49,226
But aren't you busy with
the trial and everything?

14
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:54,741
<i>Unfortunately, the woman also</i>
<i>turned out to be his father's prosecutor.</i>

15
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:58,073
<i>And so, Michael went to</i>
<i>Maggie's to reveal his identity.</i>

16
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,841
- <i>But, before he could</i>...
- It's an overview of the government's case...

17
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:03,143
against the Bluth family.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,310
What do you think? Do we have a case?

19
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:14,425
<i>Meanwhile, Michael's son,</i>
<i>George Michael...</i>

20
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:18,521
<i>discovered that his cousin</i>
<i>Maeby had been living a double life.</i>

21
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:23,036
Maeby, what are you doing?

22
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:26,106
I still don't get why you're pretending to be
two people, and why is one of you sick?

23
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:31,611
- Hey, you don't get giant checks
if you're healthy.
- Please welcome Surely Fünke.

24
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:33,873
Plus, who's going to
get mad at the dying girl?

25
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,940
- Surely's dying?
- I figure I'll kill her off just before graduation.

26
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:41,385
- Just so everyone gets really sad before prom.
- Someone's going to get hurt.

27
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,356
Not to mention it's kind of disrespectful
for kids who actually have this.

28
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,450
- Not a lot of kids have B.S. these days.
- What does that stand for?

29
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:49,859
I don't know. It's B.S.

30
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,956
<i>Michael wrestled with the dilemma...</i>

31
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:58,027
<i>of whether he should look at the evidence file</i>
<i>of the case against his father.</i>

32
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,438
- Michael.
- Hey, Gob. What the hell are you wearing?

33
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:04,170
What? Oh, this...

34
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:06,303
The wife likes me in bright sweaters.

35
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,508
<i>Gob, in a series of escalating dares...</i>

36
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:12,347
<i>recently got married to a woman</i>
<i>he had only known for an evening.</i>

37
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:15,149
Your wife? She's still your wife?

38
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,692
Well, I went to break up with her last night,
but my timing was not great.

39
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:22,661
- So, I think we should talk.
- My parents are getting a divorce.

40
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,698
Why aren't you wearing
that sweater I bought you?

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,166
- What, you don't like it?
- No. Of course I like it.

42
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,363
just because I like it doesn't mean I have to
wear it. I don't wear everything I like.

43
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,736
Why don't we just get a divorce?
Everybody else is.

44
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:37,436
No! We're not getting divorced.

45
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:40,275
She really wants to stay together, so...

46
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:43,612
Well, least you finally
consummated it, huh?

47
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,845
"Consummated."

48
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:48,421
What is up with that "prosecutie"?

49
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:50,456
- I hope you didn't break up with her?
- No, I didn't.

50
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:52,458
And to make matters worse,
she gave me this.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,528
It's a summary of the evidence
that they have against Dad.

52
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:58,120
Okay, Michael.
This makes matters better.

53
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,359
Let's just destroy it
and move on with our lives.

54
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:03,266
This is not the actual evidence.
It's just a list of the evidence.

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,703
And judging by the amount of boxes she has
in her place, I have a feeling there's a lot.

56
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:10,436
A feeling? Oh, don't tell me you won't
open it on ethical grounds?

57
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,603
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

58
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:16,342
- What is with the insane moral code in this family?
- Yes, we did it.

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,749
We're getting rid of the Ten Commandments.
The granite ones in front of the courthouse.

60
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:21,822
You know, all it took
was the threat of a lawsuit.

61
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:24,618
You're involved with those protesters now?
When did that happen?

62
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,590
Oh, who can remember.

63
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:29,026
<i>Lindsay's involvement</i>
<i>began hours before...</i>

64
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,496
<i>when, leaving the plea hearing,</i>
<i>she first determined...</i>

65
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,624
<i>the Ten Commandments didn't belong there.</i>

66
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:38,296
And they won't even allow
me one lousy cigarette!

67
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:42,239
Honey, they're just heels.
They can only support so much weight.

68
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,250
<i>I've always been very passionate about</i>
<i>the separation of church and state.</i>

69
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:54,150
- What are you gonna do with them?
- Give 'em to a school.

70
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:56,883
Can we let another family
bring down the Ten Commandments?

71
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,925
This family's already done
more than its share.

72
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:01,654
Oh, now you love
the Ten Commandments.

73
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:05,596
And yet, you're the one who so conveniently
forgot "Thou shalt protect thy father...

74
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,931
and honor no one above him
unless it beith me... thy sweet Lord."

75
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:12,631
I'm not sure that one
made it down the mountain, Gob.

76
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,300
- I told you someone would get hurt.
- If I knew it was you...

77
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,639
- I wouldn't have been so worried.
- Hey, what happened to you?

78
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:21,545
He was trying to help some handicapped
girl up to the bleachers, and he fell.

79
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,016
It's just a sprain.
But at least it's legitimate.

80
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:28,577
Ah, <i>le</i> clumsy adolescence.
It's a phase we've all been through.

81
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:33,820
Except for me. I was like a cat.
I always ended up on all fours.

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,389
- Like a cat.
- Wait a minute. They don't
have ramps at your school?

83
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,470
- Well, not up the bleachers.
- You should threaten to sue.

84
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:47,302
- It's free if it's just a threat, you know.
- Hey, that's a good idea.

85
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:49,569
No one's gonna sue anybody.
I'm not gonna have my son...

86
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:52,145
start abusing the legal system
like the rest of this family.

87
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:56,706
After all, we're gonna need it
for years to come.

88
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:59,377
<i>And that's when Michael</i>
<i>decided to do the right thing.</i>

89
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:07,553
So what do you think? Do we have
a case against this idiot family or what?

90
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,630
Well, that's actually why
I wanted to talk to you, Maggie.

91
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:16,363
You see, uh, it turns out that
I am actually one of those idiots.

92
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,930
I might even be the main idiot. Well, I'm not
the main idiot, but I'm the idiot in charge.

93
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,839
Yeah. I'm Michael Bluth. Okay?

94
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:26,276
And I want you to know that
I never opened up this folder.

95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,679
And if you could see my face...

96
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:32,684
uh, you'd see how sorry I am
that I lied to you.

97
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,456
You feel sincere.

98
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:42,518
Damn it. I have spent
the last five hours hating you...

99
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,962
ever since I found out you were
Michael Bluth in court.

100
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:48,967
- What? How did you know?
- I'm blind, Michael.

101
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,435
- I'm not stuffed up.
- You smelled me.

102
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:55,269
- I smelled you, baby.
- Maggie, why didn't you tell me at your house?

103
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,401
And why did you give me this folder?

104
00:05:57,511 --> 00:06:01,072
I was manipulating you.
This isn't the real list.

105
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:04,878
- This is a wish list.
- I can't believe you set me up.

106
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:07,453
Well, you lied to me.
Chareth Cutestory?

107
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:09,715
I know."Thou shalt not
make up a name in vain."

108
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:13,452
But, you know, I walked into that court,
and I saw you there...

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,088
- and... this can't happen, right?
- You're damn right this can't happen.

110
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,996
Look at me. This could get me...
Are you actually looking at me?

111
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:24,093
- Yes, I am.
- Okay. I could get disbarred for this.

112
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,934
And your dad would have to
spend tons more time in prison.

113
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,839
I gotta tell you something.
The thing that really gets to me is...

114
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:33,903
that I keep hearing that Michael Bluth is so...
cute.

115
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:39,646
Well, I know Maggie Lizer is adorable.
You don't know what you're missing.

116
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,482
- Really?
- Really.

117
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:46,218
- So what are we gonna do?
- I guess we're just gonna
have to go our separate ways...

118
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:49,421
- and agree to never speak about this again.
- That is probably best, huh?

119
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,591
The least you can do is buy me a drink.

120
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,602
Hmm. Yeah. I'll stay for one drink.

121
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:11,379
<i>The next morning, Michael,</i>
<i>once again, found himself at Maggie's.</i>

122
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,852
- <i>And once again, berated himself</i>
<i>for the mistake.</i>
- Oh, no.

123
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:17,150
I'm supposed to be at the prison
to talk to my dad in half an hour.

124
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:20,556
- I can't believe we did this again.
- It was so stupid.

125
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:26,293
Incredibly stupid. It's like
we're making naughty sex even naughtier.

126
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:31,968
Oh, no. I was supposed to be at the prison
to talk to my dad a half an hour ago.

127
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:34,370
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

128
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:37,035
This is the second most
unethical thing I've ever done.

129
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:40,136
- We cannot pretend that
this didn't happen, Maggie.
- Or that it won't happen again.

130
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:44,013
- You think it's gonna happen again?
- You tell me.

131
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:51,251
- Let's just assume that it will
happen again at some time.
- Right. Right.

132
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:54,759
We just need to, you know,
acknowledge this and keep it private...

133
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:57,490
- and I don't think that there's
anything wrong with that.
- Right.

134
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,692
I have a job, you know?
I'm trying to keep a man in prison.

135
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,827
Right. And that man happens to be my father.

136
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:07,566
- This could get ugly.
- Well, it's like the Ten Commandments saying.

137
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:11,872
- "Be true to thine own self,
and to thine own self..."
- "Be true." Yeah.

138
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,880
- Number seven.
- We'll just have to keep it a secret.

139
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:20,010
- Our secret.
- Our dirty little secret.

140
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,883
- I think I'm ready now.
- All right.

141
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:24,116
Okay.

142
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:28,024
<i>Thirty-two minutes earlier,</i>
<i>Gob, Lucille and Barry met with George Sr.</i>

143
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:32,258
- Where did you get this?
- They don't call me
a sleight-of-hand artist for nothing.

144
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:37,702
<i>Gob had switched out</i>
<i>the file while his siblings discussed</i>
<i>the Ten Commandments.</i>

145
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:40,603
<i>I've always been very passionate</i>
<i>about the separation of church and state.</i>

146
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:44,143
- <i>What are you gonna do with them?</i>
- <i>Give 'em to a school.</i>

147
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:48,112
<i>Can we let another family</i>
<i>bring down the Ten Commandments?</i>

148
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:50,775
Now you love the Ten Commandments.

149
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:54,183
Apparently, there are boxes
of it at the prosecutor's house.

150
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:57,223
I tracked down the address,
and you should be thanking me for this.

151
00:08:57,324 --> 00:09:00,316
Michael didn't want you to have it.
Mr. Moral.

152
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:03,919
Mm. Yeah, we did something
right there, huh?

153
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:07,398
- <i>So what do you think, Barry?</i>
- l-I haven't read it.

154
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,470
I had a really interesting
date last night.

155
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:13,938
A woman who actually works two jobs.

156
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:19,142
Well, it certainly looks like
they've got a lot on us.

157
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:22,409
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, you. I was raising the children.

158
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:24,484
When was the last time
you raised children?

159
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:28,578
Excuse me? I've got two in
the waiting room right this moment.

160
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:30,919
<i>In fact, Buster and Annyong...</i>

161
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:34,255
<i>Lucille's newly adopted</i>
<i>Korean child, were waiting.</i>

162
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:37,524
Wow. I wonder what
they're talking about in there?

163
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:41,761
- They don't tell you anything, huh?
- They tell me things.

164
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,771
It doesn't matter though, because Dad
is gonna be in here a long time.

165
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:48,341
No. We have court day today.

166
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:52,401
They take plea.
Daddy come home. You out.

167
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:55,141
<i>Annyong had hit a nerve,</i>
<i>and Buster recalled...</i>

168
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:58,878
<i>that right before George Sr. 's arrest,</i>
<i>he'd made a similar threat.</i>

169
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:03,116
I said he could wear that tie.
It looks better on him.

170
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,453
- No, no. Let me help you with that, son.
- Oh.

171
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,689
Hey, enjoy yourself tonight,
because you are out of here.

172
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:14,324
I'm not gonna spend my retirement
watching you wipe your nose on your sleeve.

173
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,629
- I can't breathe, Dad.
- Neither can I.

174
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:20,070
I haven't seen half this stuff...

175
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:23,905
but they've got these kind of documents,
uh, we've gotta get rid of this.

176
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:27,845
If you're thinking of stealing the evidence,
that is a very big offense.

177
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:32,885
l-I think I'm gonna say that I signed
myself out about 10 minutes ago.

178
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:35,216
You're right.
You can't afford to get caught.

179
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:38,849
I don't need my lawyer in prison.
We'll have Gob break in.

180
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,419
Well, gee, Dad,
I've got a wife now.

181
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,498
I don't think that I can
afford to get caught either.

182
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:50,832
Good point. You might want to
change out of that sweater.

183
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:53,338
Tell me again why this isn't wrong.

184
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,671
Look. We are just... we're two adults.
We've got absolutely nothing...

185
00:10:56,777 --> 00:11:00,178
- Cops. Hide.
- <i>Ms. Lizer.</i>

186
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,373
- It's Officer Kelley.
- Oh, hi.

187
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:05,212
Your office has asked me
to come pick you up. It's a surprise.

188
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:10,987
- I just winked. It's a surprise witness.
- Oh, great.

189
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:12,956
- Um...
- How are we doing?

190
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,520
I'll just put my dog inside,
and then I will be right with you.

191
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,259
I'll take the dog, okay? I've already
missed my meeting. You go ahead.

192
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,165
- Just put him through the doggy door.
- Okay.

193
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,795
- And, uh, I'll see you in court.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:28,374
- My dad's not gonna put himself in prison for life.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,033
- Bye. Kiss.
- Oh.

196
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:33,738
<i>And Gob decided to</i>
<i>pass offhis break-in assignment to Tobias.</i>

197
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:38,750
<i>Hey, there's the cat. Sorry you couldn't</i>
<i>have been down at the prison with us.</i>

198
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:42,913
- Dad was asking all about you.
- Oh. I doubt that very much.

199
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:47,824
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. He feels
you've been sucking off this family far too long.

200
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:52,729
If you don't start pulling your weight around
here, it's gonna be shape up or ship up.

201
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:57,099
<i>You know, try as I might,</i>
<i>I cannot seem to impress that man.</i>

202
00:11:57,204 --> 00:12:00,833
Isn't that funny... ...
I'm about to knock his socks off again.

203
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,399
Yeah, I'm gonna break into this house
that's got a bunch of evidence in it.

204
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,241
just to borrow it.
Ensure his freedom forever.

205
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,782
But, it's a tough job.
Might require some agility.

206
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:12,081
But, it's a tough job.
Might require some agility.

207
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:15,313
This kind of agility?

208
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:18,585
Let's go, little man.

209
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:23,152
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had decided</i>
<i>to see what life in Maggie's world was like.</i>

210
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:27,826
All right. Okay.

211
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,993
All right. Okay.

212
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:36,031
- Okay.
- This guy's the real deal. He's on the inside.

213
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:40,102
- But, he's got some demands.
- This could be the break we wanted.

214
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:43,444
- This is District Attorney Lizer.
- All right. What do you want?

215
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,680
Uh, l-I want immunity for
me and my mom...

216
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:50,621
and I want my dad to stay in prison.

217
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,955
- Also, can you send Annyong back to Korea?
- Huh?

218
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:58,256
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Justice!

219
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,866
<i>Meanwhile, Maggie's interrogation</i>
<i>of Buster was proving fruitless.</i>

220
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,464
Do you know anything
about your father's trips overseas?

221
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:12,011
I knew I'd have a fun time
at home alone with Mom.

222
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:16,913
<i>Fine. Did you ever see him</i>
<i>return from these trips...</i>

223
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:19,144
- with anything unusual?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:21,720
He came back home once
with a black statue...

225
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:24,655
with an erect penis.

226
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:27,386
It stayed in our living room
until my aunt objected.

227
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,228
What about business associates?

228
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,232
- I have none.
- All right.

229
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:37,997
This guy's wasting our time.
Take away his grilled cheese.

230
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:42,235
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

231
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:45,505
If it's evidence you want, I know where
they keep it. According to my brother...

232
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:48,445
there are boxes of evidence
in a house on Scenic View Drive.

233
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:52,177
- Isn't that where you live?
- Yeah.

234
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:56,346
And I'm headed there now.

235
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,914
<i>Tobias, meanwhile,</i>
<i>had used his catlike agility...</i>

236
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:04,156
- <i>to get the evidence at Maggie's house.</i>
- The cat is in.

237
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:07,722
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was just as Maggie came home.</i>

238
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,844
Is there someone here?

239
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,072
<i>Tobias, concerned about</i>
<i>Maggie's heightened sense of smell...</i>

240
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:23,809
<i>set off to cloak himself</i>
<i>in her scent.</i>

241
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,830
- <i>And Michael was at the vet's office.</i>
- Justice is fine.

242
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:47,566
- Great.
- Although, dressing him up like a seeing-eye dog...

243
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:50,142
- seems a little cruel.
- Cruel?

244
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,234
Well, yeah, because he can't see.

245
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:54,677
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:54,781 --> 00:14:57,409
Mr. Bluth, Justice is blind.

247
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,317
justice cannot be blind, Doc.

248
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:09,987
He's got a handle and everything.
Come on, boy.

249
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,669
Maybe his peripheral isn't great...

250
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:20,239
but he's been leading
a blind woman around.

251
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,740
I think she's been leading him around.

252
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:26,802
But that would mean that
Maggie isn't blind.

253
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,541
<i>In fact, Maggie wasn't blind...</i>

254
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,243
- <i>but had been pretending to be...</i>
- Son of a bitch.

255
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,820
<i>since she found it helpful</i>
<i>in taking the LSATs.</i>

256
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,389
"D." "B" places fourth.

257
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:45,554
- "A"?
- <i>Finding it a tremendous boon</i>
<i>to her professional life...</i>

258
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:49,965
- <i>Maggie continued the ruse.</i>
- I submit into evidence this wine glass...

259
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,538
with the defendant's fingerprints.

260
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:58,942
Don't worry. You're so ahead.

261
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,343
<i>Her ability to see, however...</i>

262
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,575
<i>was currently proving a disadvantage...</i>

263
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:06,675
<i>as she couldn't reveal to the man</i>
<i>she recognized as Tobias...</i>

264
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:10,222
<i>that she knew he was there</i>
<i>without betraying her secret.</i>

265
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,364
<i>And Tobias was finding her an uncannily</i>
<i>difficult blind girl to outmaneuver.</i>

266
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:32,545
<i>Their game of cat and mouse continued.</i>

267
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,781
<i>Until Michael showed up to return Justice.</i>

268
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:43,845
Oh, Justice, what is it, boy?
What is it?

269
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:47,825
Is there some jackass in my bathrobe?

270
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:53,962
Oh! I can't see!

271
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,434
<i>And later, the family gathered at</i>
<i>the courthouse to respond to the plea offer.</i>

272
00:16:57,537 --> 00:17:01,268
They don't have a case against us.
I took care of everything.

273
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:05,174
- Something smells wonderful.
- Well, thank you.

274
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:08,076
Would that I could say that
I wore it to impress you...

275
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:13,619
but, no, I'm afraid it's merely a cloaking
agent from a sadly blunderous afternoon.

276
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,087
Who else have we got?
What about Buster?

277
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,785
Worst-case scenario
he gets caught, no more Buster.

278
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:23,692
I'm not going anywhere.
You're the one who's staying put.

279
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,425
Not me. You.

280
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:30,094
What's gotten into you?
Have you been eating cheese?

281
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:36,205
<i>Outside the courthouse,</i>
<i>Surely Fünke was addressing the crowd.</i>

282
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,607
<i>George Michael prepared to</i>
<i>confront her about it.</i>

283
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:42,113
Not just to me, but to all
handicapped kids out there...

284
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:46,345
who are sick and tired of sitting in
the front rows at basketball games.

285
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:49,354
<i>George Michael spotted his father...</i>

286
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:53,119
<i>and not wanting to appear to be abusing</i>
<i>the legal system, found a place to hide.</i>

287
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:58,493
<i>Michael, determined to expose Maggie,</i>
<i>hid to avoid tipping his hand.</i>

288
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:04,459
<i>It was then, however, that Lindsay's</i>
<i>advocacy group had their big moment.</i>

289
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,208
Hey, George Michael,
what are you doing here?

290
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:12,767
I just thought I'd come down
and see the family. See everyone.

291
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:14,506
- Oh.
- That's why I'm here.

292
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:17,139
Well, pal, you don't need to do that.
You can head on home.

293
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,241
Why don't you go help that
handicapped friend of yours?

294
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:23,311
- She kind of lied to me.
- I was recently lied to myself.

295
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:26,256
And for what it's worth, George Michael,
you cannot let people get away with that.

296
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,486
It's just so hard to know what
the right thing to do is.

297
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:31,564
I know it. It's not like
there's some list of rules...

298
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,963
- handed down to us from on high.
- No.

299
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,058
Watch your head.

300
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:49,377
<i>So Michael set out to expose in court</i>
<i>that Maggie wasn't really blind.</i>

301
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:52,508
- She's right there. What are we gonna do?
- I got a plan.

302
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,918
Your Honor, the purpose of
a court of law is to find the truth...

303
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:59,082
which is why witnesses swear on this.

304
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,217
<i>After all, they sayjustice is blind.</i>

305
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:05,661
Surely, she has enough sight
to catch the truth...

306
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:08,563
before it hits her in the face.

307
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:11,136
Objection, Your...

308
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,673
<i>Unfortunately, Maggie had been</i>
<i>temporarily blinded that day.</i>

309
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:17,470
- I can't see!
- Bailiff.

310
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,545
That was my plan.
What do you got?

311
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:25,306
<i>So George Michael decided to</i>
<i>once and for all put an end to Surely Fünke.</i>

312
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:28,148
- I need to talk to you.
- And this is the man who inspired me.

313
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:32,213
George Michael Bluth.

314
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:35,089
He is the one who is responsible for
the new ramps at our school.

315
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:39,154
And he will carry on my legacy
and put an end to B.S.

316
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:50,808
- Surely can beat this thing.
- No more B.S. No more B.S.

317
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,869
<i>And Michael reunited with</i>
<i>Maggie, who had been kicked off the case.</i>

318
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:57,677
I really thought you were lying to me.
I am so sorry.

319
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:01,584
Michael, I've been doing
this blind act thing for years. It's wacked.

320
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:05,317
- Are you going to admit that you were faking it?
- I think I'm gonna go for...

321
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:09,293
"I was struck by the Bible
and it restored my sight."

322
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:16,130
So what about us?
We were starting to establish some trust...

323
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:18,295
except for all the lies.

324
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:20,599
You know, I was originally looking for
something completely uncomplicated.

325
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:24,165
Yeah. Me too.
Forget it. This is so over.

326
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:27,337
You know, we're saying good-bye,
and this is actually the first time...

327
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,540
that I feel that you can really see me.

328
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,277
Yeah.

329
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:36,344
We're just two people
staring at each other...

330
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:41,359
fully exposed in a court of law.

331
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:57,869
justice!

332
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:00,502
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

333
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:04,014
<i>Barry gets a sign</i>
<i>from God.</i>

334
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:07,177
<i>I will obey your will.</i>
<i>I will lead a good life.</i>

335
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:11,290
Well, the hell
with this then!

336
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:14,849
<i>And Maggie is replaced</i>
<i>with a new, less generous, prosecutor.</i>

337
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,452
I was made to understand there were
grilled cheese sandwiches here.

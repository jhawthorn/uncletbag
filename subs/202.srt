1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,530
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,608
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,773
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,853
<i>Michael Bluth was at home</i>
<i>working on a plan to save the company.</i>

6
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,859
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black...

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,088
by starting construction
on the phase two development.

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,096
I know what you're thinking,
we're not in the black.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,689
How're we gonna build 30 houses without
any money? We don't. We build one-

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,703
then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony
while raising funds for the others.

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,104
<i>Michael's father always</i>
<i>unveiled his construction projects...</i>

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,405
<i>with a highly publicized</i>
<i>ribbon-cutting ceremony.</i>

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,742
<i>He even did so</i>
<i>for the prison he built...</i>

14
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,543
<i>and, somewhat ironically,</i>
<i>would later occupy.</i>

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,416
The only difference is this time
I get to cut the ribbon. What do you think?

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,614
There's a cream
with real diamonds in it.

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,557
I can actually smear diamonds on my face,
and it's only $400 a tub.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,152
That's like, what, like
a million diamonds for $400?

19
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,562
- Mm.
- A million- diamonds.

20
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,227
- Okay.
- <i>Is she on you about that diamond cream?</i>

21
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,964
<i>My husband's jealous because since</i>
<i>we decided to have an open marriage...</i>

22
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,064
I've been doing
a little better than he has.

23
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,302
It is not a competition, Lindsay.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,742
We are doing this
to save our marriage.

25
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,612
<i>But I should be telling you that I have</i>
<i>been meeting my fair share of groupies.</i>

26
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,276
Or should I say "Bluepies"?

27
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,581
<i>Tobias had recently</i>
<i>auditioned as an understudy...</i>

28
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,452
<i>for the silent performance</i>
<i>art trio, the Blue Man Group.</i>

29
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:36,188
And this is "Kids" from <i>Bye, Bye, Birdie.</i>

30
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,931
<i>He had yet to hear back from them.</i>

31
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,525
You guys really think you have the guts to go
through with this "seeing other people" thing?

32
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,538
<i>In fact, neither Lindsay nor</i>
<i>Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.</i>

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,540
- I already have.
- I have too.

34
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,769
Can I buy you a drink?

35
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,972
No.
- <i>Lindsay, because</i>
<i>she'd lost her self-confidence.</i>

36
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,050
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?

37
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,678
<i>And Tobias, because</i>
<i>he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.</i>

38
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,222
Who are you gonna bring
to this ribbon-cutting dance?

39
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,454
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...

40
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,359
I'd love for you to come with me
when I cut the ribbon at the new house.

41
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,398
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,195
Who?

43
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,668
Ann. You know, she's- she's the girl
I'm kinda hanging out with.

44
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,295
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.

45
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,705
- <i>Michael had met Ann.</i>
- You let her in.

46
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,812
See, that's her right over there.

47
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,814
- <i>Oh, Ann. Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>
- Yeah.

48
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:34,148
I know Ann. Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.

49
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,916
Oh, it's so cute. She sometimes takes
a little pack of mayonnaise...

50
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,389
and she'll squirt it in her mouth,
and then she'll take an egg...

51
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,653
and kind of- mmm.

52
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,559
She calls it a mayonn-egg.

53
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,757
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.

54
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,494
You know, I kind of wanna
buy her a diamond.

55
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,332
- Her?
- Ann.

56
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,373
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay
was telling me about this diamond cream.

57
00:02:55,475 --> 00:03:00,105
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is
a very nice person. I just don't want you spending-

58
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,546
- It's Ann. Her na-
- all your money getting her
all glittered up for Easter.

59
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,675
You know? More importantly,
I want us to do this together.

60
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,185
Kinda like a father-son
sort of thing, you know?

61
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,689
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president,
we get to do it.

62
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,352
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.

63
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,328
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>since Michael's father escaped from prison...</i>

64
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,424
<i>his brother Gob had been made president,</i>
<i>albeit in name only.</i>

65
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,993
<i>Which is why Michael was surprised</i>
<i>when he got to work the next day.</i>

66
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,097
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.

67
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,769
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?

68
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,473
Just doing this to appease the stockholders,
while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.

69
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,712
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes
in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.

70
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,810
I know, but that's why
I've got a business model...

71
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,549
that I think is going
to restore the image of our company.

72
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,557
We're going to build
a second model home.

73
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,718
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?

74
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Gee, it is my business model.

75
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,730
If you had a business model, then by all means,
go in there and do your little dance.

76
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,824
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.

77
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,426
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.

78
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,769
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though. It should beat everything.

79
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:06,106
There's not a lot of logic to it. It's like
on a boat with "Women and children first."

80
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,909
Why should they-which, before I forget,
I'm buying a company boat.

81
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,916
Sorry?

82
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,419
<i>That morning, Gob had gone to a</i>
<i>boat show, where he saw something he wanted.</i>

83
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,921
- Hello.
- Hi.

84
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,958
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.

85
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,425
- I meant you.
- Well.

86
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,929
<i>Gob flirted with her</i>
<i>for a while, and finally asked for her number.</i>

87
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:30,093
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry. I don't give it out without a firm offer.

88
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,036
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.

89
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,164
<i>Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.</i>

90
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,711
And here again, please.

91
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,644
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.

92
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,649
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.

93
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,276
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine. But rock sinks boat.

94
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,912
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.

95
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,356
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.

96
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,790
<i>It's about your Uncle Oscar.</i>
<i>I want him to move in with you.</i>

97
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,957
You're not kicking him out
already, are you?

98
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,332
<i>Michael's uncle</i>
<i>had recently moved into Lucille's apartment...</i>

99
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,895
<i>where they quickly rekindled</i>
<i>a long-dormant romance.</i>

100
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,135
- <i>It was a secret she hoped to keep-</i>
- Oscar, we'll be heard.

101
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,712
- <i>and he didn't.</i>
- That's what makes it so hot.

102
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,043
<i>Mother?</i>

103
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,673
<i>Mother!</i>

104
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,153
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing. Go back to bed.

105
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,247
<i>So, everybody's still up, huh?</i>

106
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,656
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.

107
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,359
He's going into the army,
for God's sake.

108
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,834
You volunteered him.

109
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,168
I knew you were going to
throw that in my face.

110
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,504
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.

111
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,976
<i>At that moment, Buster was taking</i>
<i>his physical at the recruitment center.</i>

112
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,379
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.

113
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,508
My-
Reproductive organ...

114
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,848
is shaped like-
a lobster tail...

115
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,354
but without its shell, hmm?

116
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,652
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks
under control.

117
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,284
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.

118
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,024
<i>But Buster had miscalculated</i>
<i>the army's current need for personnel.</i>

119
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,032
Okay, then, let's get you fitted
for a uniform.

120
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,694
What? What?

121
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,397
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.

122
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,633
He'd never cut his hair.

123
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,733
That hair.

124
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,972
Listen, Oscar's your problem. I'm taking care
of everything else in this family...

125
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,607
including starting construction
on a second model home.

126
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,049
We're having
a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

127
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,554
We can't have a ribbon-cutting
without your father, and he's God knows where.

128
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,920
<i>George Sr. Was in Mexico...</i>

129
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,050
<i>with his escape accomplice</i>
<i>and ex-secretary, Kitty.</i>

130
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:39,962
I keep eating so many eggs. It must be
my unconscious desire to have a baby.

131
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,059
Oh, my God. Can you even imagine how cute
the combination of the two of us would be?

132
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,032
I mean, we're all out of
"prophylacticos" anyway.

133
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,078
Somebody used the last two on his feet
to walk across the bathroom floor.

134
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,046
<i>But he was growing tired</i>
<i>of their confined intimacy.</i>

135
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,913
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.

136
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,646
- Dad?
- Yeah. Listen, I gotta make this quick.

137
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,281
You're the only one who can save the family,
but you gotta keep the company strong...

138
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,416
because I'm gonna need
some of that money later.

139
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,791
I will, Dad. It's funny,
after all these years of...

140
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,922
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!

141
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,365
Oh, for God's- I called to talk to Michael,
you horse's-

142
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,170
- <i>Gob was hurt.</i>
- Bye, Pop.

143
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,038
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?

144
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,543
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.

145
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,773
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?

146
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,781
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.

147
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,374
- <i>Down South America way.</i>
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?

148
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,785
No, he wanted to talk
to the president.

149
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,450
- I have no problem with that.
- <i>Michael was also hurt.</i>

150
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,687
<i>And George Sr.</i>
<i>Was brutally hurt...</i>

151
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,286
<i>when he was mistaken</i>
<i>for his twin brother Oscar.</i>

152
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,525
<i>Marijuana? No, no.</i>

153
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,659
That's my brother.
"Brothero. Brothero."

154
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,239
<i>That night, Lindsay headed to the club...</i>

155
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,275
<i>to try again to meet someone.</i>

156
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,682
<i>Soon, having struck out again,</i>
<i>she spotted a man who looked interesting.</i>

157
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,187
<i>He had the lean look,</i>
<i>effortless hair...</i>

158
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,348
<i>and dressed-down manner</i>
<i>of a movie star.</i>

159
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,689
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.

160
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,922
I know a place.

161
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,829
<i>It was at that point</i>
<i>that Lindsay had a startling revelation.</i>

162
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,803
Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out. Get out. Out, out, out!

163
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,342
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless? You're homeless?

164
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,935
You're gross. Oh, God.

165
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,686
They're taking me in the army. They didn't
think there was enough wrong with me.

166
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,450
Well, did they check everything?

167
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,517
Yes. They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.

168
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,688
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.

169
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,697
Let's calm down, people.

170
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,927
Um, I think I know a little bit
about avoiding combat duty.

171
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,368
Now which pinkie do you use less?

172
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,771
Are you nuts? Do you know
what I went through to have this boy?

173
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,402
Oh, I know where the boy came from.

174
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,039
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?

175
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,545
<i>And Lucille realized</i>
<i>it was time to end...</i>

176
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,554
<i>whatever it was</i>
<i>she had with Oscar.</i>

177
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,556
So, I believe it's a good plan.

178
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,150
<i>The next day, Michael was ready to wow</i>
<i>the board with his new business model.</i>

179
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,491
As I told my brother,
the president...

180
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,622
if we start construction
on a second model home...

181
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,132
we can be cutting this ribbon
within two months.

182
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,566
I said, "That's why you're
no longer president."

183
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:39,270
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks. Hey!

184
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,578
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?

185
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,119
<i>I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.</i>

186
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,383
Gob, I think we both agree
that we would do things your way...

187
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,754
if you had a business model.

188
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,453
Do you have
a business model, Gob?

189
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,962
I am so happy
that you asked me that, Michael...

190
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,933
because I just happen
to have a business model right here.

191
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,868
<i>Solid as a rock</i>

192
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,373
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company
business model...

193
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,534
<i>for our phase two campaign.</i>

194
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,943
Solid as a rock.

195
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,210
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting
in two weeks...

196
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,877
if my brother doesn't
screw it up first.

197
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,023
- Hey!

198
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:31,126
<i>Gob had committed Michael</i>
<i>to building a model home in two weeks.</i>

199
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,394
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"...

200
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,527
helps people forget the fact
that we built houses in Iraq.

201
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,970
- I love that.
- But you probably know best
because you're president.

202
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,973
We don't have to build
a real house, Michael.

203
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,567
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.

204
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,647
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?

205
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,308
Nothing on the inside.

206
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,011
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.

207
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,418
Then you build it
yourself, damn it!

208
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,219
Hey, there she is,
my little business model.

209
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,723
Sorry about that
"build it yourself' crap.

210
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,560
I might take her
to the ribbon-cutting.

211
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,931
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.

212
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,164
<i>As Michael grew frustrated</i>
<i>by his relationship with Gob...</i>

213
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,934
<i>Lucille tried to end hers</i>
<i>with Oscar.</i>

214
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,533
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.

215
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,910
Oscar, no. I can't have this in my life
anymore. I'm a married woman.

216
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,176
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.

217
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,946
But before you do, ask yourself,
"Where's your husband?"

218
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,081
Because I am here. I am real.
I am flesh and blood.

219
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,091
<i>And hair.</i>

220
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,060
Oh, God, that hair.

221
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,654
What will people say?

222
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,996
They'll say,
"Those people are in love."

223
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,397
<i>That night, the evening news</i>
<i>report said something very different.</i>

224
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,876
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape
breathing life into a homeless man.

225
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,879
The surprising home video
at 10:00.

226
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,949
<i>And Michael prepared to build a house.</i>

227
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,541
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?

228
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,645
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...

229
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,657
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.

230
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,920
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.

231
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,758
He is homeless.

232
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,060
Well, I didn't know
he was homeless at the time.

233
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,897
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?

234
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,665
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.

235
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,402
Gangy gave C.P.R.
To a homeless guy on the beach.

236
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,444
<i>Lindsay felt respect for her mother...</i>

237
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,413
<i>and decided that perhaps she could overcome</i>
<i>her pride and help someone too.</i>

238
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:35,351
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.

239
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,787
I wonder if he even has an apartment or-

240
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,621
- Hello.
- Did you see the news?

241
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,457
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me
at the beach today...

242
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,929
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.

243
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,762
It was Uncle Oscar. Mom,
you're not having an affair with him, are you?

244
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,429
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.

245
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,769
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect. He's not a real man.

246
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,639
<i>And George Sr.</i>
<i>Made his case to the Mexican police.</i>

247
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,872
<i>My God, I was beaten up here. I'm telling you.</i>
<i>I'm George. I'm not Oscar. I'm George.</i>

248
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:06,213
- The Cornballer.
- <i>Ssí.</i> The Cornballer.

249
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:11,119
<i>George Sr. Had marketed</i>
<i>a device called the Cornballer in Mexico...</i>

250
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,488
<i>after the severe burns</i>
<i>it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.</i>

251
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,290
- Why, did you have one?
- <i>Ssí.</i>

252
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,161
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was having trouble finding her homeless man.</i>

253
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,731
- He looked like a movie star.
- <i>The man looked like a movie star</i>
<i>because he was a movie star.</i>

254
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,573
<i>His name was Tom Jane, and he was making</i>
<i>two movies for a major studio.</i>

255
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,773
<i>One was a gritty personal project</i>
<i>about a junkie's life...</i>

256
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,544
<i>which he got to do</i>
<i>in exchange for making...</i>

257
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,212
<i>a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.</i>

258
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,812
- <i>He was living on the streets, researching his role.</i>
- <i>Hey, homeless guy.</i>

259
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,518
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...

260
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,060
I was so grossed out when I found out
you were gross before.

261
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,062
You really thought
I was gross, huh?

262
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,260
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot,
but I hadn't looked closely enough.

263
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,235
Listen, I have
a construction job for you.

264
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,707
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.

265
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,007
- Okay.
- See ya.

266
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,782
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here,
but we all want the same thing.

267
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,916
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.

268
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,393
<i>I'm just hoping to get mildly injured,</i>
<i>so I can get out of the army.</i>

269
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,862
Bottom line is we've got two weeks
to build a house.

270
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,127
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.

271
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,430
I just want my kids back.

272
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,464
<i>And so, the guys went to work.</i>

273
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,804
<i>Things didn't go smoothly at first.</i>

274
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,746
<i>Buster looked for ways</i>
<i>to hurt himself.</i>

275
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:57,086
<i>But soon the project came together</i>-
<i>when Gob stopped by.</i>

276
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,564
<i>Now</i> we're building a house.

277
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,067
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think? Did I do this or what?

278
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,069
Seems like your brother did it.

279
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,435
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.

280
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,940
Where's your "P"?

281
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,671
What?
Oh, no, not again.

282
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,747
I got it.

283
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,340
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does
what I tell him to do" crap...

284
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,681
but I want this to be perfect
for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.

285
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,687
You're cutting the ribbon?

286
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,121
I kinda thought
that since I built it...

287
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,420
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.

288
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,995
Can you imagine how
that would look to the board?

289
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,430
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.

290
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,128
<i>Michael had a problem with that.</i>

291
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,569
- <i>Gob had taken away something</i>
<i>Michael always wanted.</i>
- You got the "P."

292
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,473
<i>Now it was Michael's turn</i>
<i>to take something from Gob- Starla.</i>

293
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,945
<i>And later, Michael</i>
<i>set about his plan.</i>

294
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,948
Gob, do you have
Starla's phone number?

295
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,610
<i>I got a few business things</i>
<i>I'd like to go over with the business model.</i>

296
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,815
Guess who <i>was</i> just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.

297
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,619
- Hmm?
- L- the business model.

298
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,353
<i>Actually, theyjust made out.</i>

299
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,294
Yeah, she had
all kinds of orgasms.

300
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,298
Imagine that. I finally nailed
somebody that you weren't after.

301
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,166
That's it. I've worked too hard and too long
for you to keep getting all the credit.

302
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,535
I built that company, that house,
and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon...

303
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,336
whether we're all pretending
that you're president or not.

304
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,468
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-

305
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,810
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.

306
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,852
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.

307
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,649
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.

308
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,886
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me. He never has.

309
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,065
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?

310
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,862
- Yeah. How about that?
- Michael.

311
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,937
I have no problem with it.

312
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,940
- All right? Take it easy. Come on.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,678
<i>The next day, the Bluth family</i>
<i>prepared to unveil phase two.</i>

314
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,079
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?

315
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,084
No. And I can't find that diamond dust
that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.

316
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,451
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.

317
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,354
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?

318
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,586
Well, actually, I figured,
give Gob a chance, you know?

319
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,186
The guy doesn't get
a whole lot of attention in this family.

320
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:17,792
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president</i>
<i>of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.</i>

321
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,964
My brother wasn't optimistic
it could be done.

322
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:27,136
<i>But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic</i>
<i>it could be done"...</i>

323
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,146
<i>for an answer.</i>

324
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,217
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you</i>
<i>phase two of the Bluth Company.</i>

325
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,222
A house truly solid as a rock.

326
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,723
<i>But as it turns out...</i>

327
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,995
<i>Michael was right to not be optimistic</i>
<i>it could be done.</i>

328
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,304
<i>And Buster</i>
<i>saw the chance to get injured enough...</i>

329
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,308
<i>to keep him out of the army.</i>

330
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,576
<i>But instead...</i>

331
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,083
- <i>got a glimpse inside.</i>
- <i>I can't look at that.</i>

332
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,086
<i>Unfortunately, Tobias had to.</i>

333
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,749
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry. I was looking for Lindsay.

334
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,919
<i>You lied to me.</i>
<i>You both lied to me. I'm goin'to war.</i>

335
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,328
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

336
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,923
I don't agree
with your dirty doings here...

337
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,663
but I will defend with my life
your right to do it.

338
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,840
<i>You planned this all along,</i>
<i>didn't you, Michael?</i>

339
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,775
- No, I didn't. I had no crew. I had no time.
- You set me up.

340
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,642
<i>Gob charged</i>
<i>at Michael with the scissors...</i>

341
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,614
<i>but Michael,</i>
<i>as he always did, picked rock</i>-

342
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,015
<i>- You wanted to make me look foolish!</i>
- Put down the scissors.

343
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,850
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!

344
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,186
<i>Which beat scissors.</i>

345
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,187
<i>Unfortunately, the whole incident</i>
<i>was covered by the paper.</i>

346
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,196
Nobody looks good in this.

347
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,756
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.

348
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,860
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter. Listen.

349
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,372
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight...

350
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,136
is that since we were little kids,
Dad's always played us off each other.

351
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,678
Dad always said
that was your fault.

352
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,974
Anyway, what we oughta do
is make a decision right now...

353
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,209
not to let Dad get in the middle
of our relationship anymore.

354
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,717
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.

355
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,221
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me. I'm the president of a company now.

356
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,349
Oh, that's Dad's line. I bet he saw the paper.

357
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,395
Listen, if you want my respect,
you won't answer that, okay?

358
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,396
It's just gonna
cause more problems.

359
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,897
Hello? They hung up.

360
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,269
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.

361
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,569
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.

362
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,576
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?

363
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,908
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.

364
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,346
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.

365
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,508
- These are the lines. There's a line here.
- But she said-

366
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,518
- It's line and then-
- Hey.

367
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,589
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead
for us to get along.

368
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,056
<i>But it was too late...</i>

369
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,026
<i>as George Sr. Would be declared dead...</i>

370
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,359
<i>within the hour.</i>

371
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,297
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.

372
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,564
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?

373
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,037
We almost pulled it off.

374
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,768
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.

375
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,367
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great. Not great.

376
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,413
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

377
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,916
<i>Lindsay finds out the true identity</i>
<i>ofher homeless man.</i>

378
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:24,114
Look. You're a really nice chick,
but I'm not homeless.

379
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,316
I'm Tom Jane.

380
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,450
<i>And even though Lindsay</i>
<i>doesn't know who that is...</i>

381
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,824
<i>hearing that he isn't homeless</i>
<i>is good enough for her.</i>

382
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,263
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.

383
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,267
I'm Tom Jane.

384
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,803

Tobias.

387
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,642
Lindsay, I'm-

388
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,479
Is that George Michael's
diamond cream?

389
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,077
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue,
and I couldn't find anything else.

390
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,647
I think my nipples are bleeding though. I don't
know if you're supposed to use quite this much.

391
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,491
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.

392
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,089
No, no, I am.

393
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,465
Because I think I need
to go to the hospital right away...

394
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,973
and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust
vacuumed from out of my lungs.

395
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,701
This way.
